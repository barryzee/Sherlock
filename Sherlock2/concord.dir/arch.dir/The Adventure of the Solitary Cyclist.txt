==>      From the years 1894 to 1901 inclusive Mr. Sherlock Holmes was a very <==
     busy man. It is safe to say that there was no public case of any
     difficulty in which he was not consulted during those eight years,
     and there were hundreds of private cases, some of them of the most
     intricate and extraordinary character, in which he played a prominent
     part. Many startling successes and a few unavoidable failures were

     made it stand out in those long records of crime from which I gather
     the material for these little narratives.

     On referring to my note-book for the year 1895 I find that it was
     upon Saturday, the 23rd of April, that we first heard of Miss Violet
==>      Smith. Her visit was, I remember, extremely unwelcome to Holmes, for <==
     he was immersed at the moment in a very abstruse and complicated
     problem concerning the peculiar persecution to which John Vincent
     Harden, the well-known tobacco millionaire, had been subjected. My
     friend, who loved above all things precision and concentration of
     thought, resented anything which distracted his attention from the

     herself at Baker Street late in the evening and implored his
     assistance and advice. It was vain to urge that his time was already
     fully occupied, for the young lady had come with the determination to
     tell her story, and it was evident that nothing short of force could
     get her out of the room until she had done so. With a resigned air
==>      and a somewhat weary smile, Holmes begged the beautiful intruder to <==
     take a seat and to inform us what it was that was troubling her.

     "At least it cannot be your health," said he, as his keen eyes darted
     over her; "so ardent a bicyclist must be full of energy."

     She glanced down in surprise at her own feet, and I observed the
     slight roughening of the side of the sole caused by the friction of
     the edge of the pedal.

==>      "Yes, I bicycle a good deal, Mr. Holmes, and that has something to do <==
     with my visit to you to-day."

     My friend took the lady's ungloved hand and examined it with as close
     an attention and as little sentiment as a scientist would show to a
     specimen.

     the spatulate finger-end, Watson, which is common to both
     professions? There is a spirituality about the face, however"--he
     gently turned it towards the light--"which the typewriter does not
     generate. This lady is a musician."

==>      "Yes, Mr. Holmes, I teach music." <==

     "In the country, I presume, from your complexion."

     "Yes, sir; near Farnham, on the borders of Surrey."

     to you near Farnham, on the borders of Surrey?"

     The young lady, with great clearness and composure, made the
     following curious statement:--

==>      "My father is dead, Mr. Holmes. He was James Smith, who conducted the <==
     orchestra at the old Imperial Theatre. My mother and I were left
     without a relation in the world except one uncle, Ralph Smith, who
     went to Africa twenty-five years ago, and we have never had a word
     from him since. When father died we were left very poor, but one day
     we were told that there was an advertisement in the Times inquiring

     took no notice of us when he was alive, should be so careful to look
     after us when he was dead; but Mr. Carruthers explained that the
     reason was that my uncle had just heard of the death of his brother,
     and so felt responsible for our fate."

==>      "Excuse me," said Holmes; "when was this interview?" <==

     "Last December--four months ago."

     "Pray proceed."


[line number in individual story] matching line = 110    window = 105 115

     making eyes at me--a coarse, puffy-faced, red-moustached young man,
     with his hair plastered down on each side of his forehead. I thought
     that he was perfectly hateful--and I was sure that Cyril would not
     wish me to know such a person."

==>      "Oh, Cyril is his name!" said Holmes, smiling. <==

     The young lady blushed and laughed.

     "Yes, Mr. Holmes; Cyril Morton, an electrical engineer, and we hope
     to be married at the end of the summer. Dear me, how did I get

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 34578    window = 34573 34583



     "Oh, Cyril is his name!" said Holmes, smiling.

     The young lady blushed and laughed.

==>      "Yes, Mr. Holmes; Cyril Morton, an electrical engineer, and we hope <==
     to be married at the end of the summer. Dear me, how did I get
     talking about him? What I wished to say was that Mr. Woodley was
     perfectly odious, but that Mr. Carruthers, who was a much older man,
     was more agreeable. He was a dark, sallow, clean-shaven, silent
     person; but he had polite manners and a pleasant smile. He inquired

     open. That was the end of his visit, as you can imagine. Mr.
     Carruthers apologized to me next day, and assured me that I should
     never be exposed to such an insult again. I have not seen Mr. Woodley
     since.

==>      "And now, Mr. Holmes, I come at last to the special thing which has <==
     caused me to ask your advice to-day. You must know that every
     Saturday forenoon I ride on my bicycle to Farnham Station in order to
     get the 12.22 to town. The road from Chiltern Grange is a lonely one,
     and at one spot it is particularly so, for it lies for over a mile
     between Charlington Heath upon one side and the woods which lie round

     Hill. Two weeks ago I was passing this place when I chanced to look
     back over my shoulder, and about two hundred yards behind me I saw a
     man, also on a bicycle. He seemed to be a middle-aged man, with a
     short, dark beard. I looked back before I reached Farnham, but the
     man was gone, so I thought no more about it. But you can imagine how
==>      surprised I was, Mr. Holmes, when on my return on the Monday I saw <==
     the same man on the same stretch of road. My astonishment was
     increased when the incident occurred again, exactly as before, on the
     following Saturday and Monday. He always kept his distance and did
     not molest me in any way, but still it certainly was very odd. I
     mentioned it to Mr. Carruthers, who seemed interested in what I said,

[line number in individual story] matching line = 190    window = 185 195

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 34654    window = 34649 34659


     stop. But he never appeared. Then I went back and looked round the
     corner. I could see a mile of road, but he was not on it. To make it
     the more extraordinary, there was no side road at this point down
     which he could have gone."

==>      Holmes chuckled and rubbed his hands. "This case certainly presents <==
     some features of its own," said he. "How much time elapsed between
     your turning the corner and your discovery that the road was clear?"

     "Two or three minutes."

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 34674    window = 34669 34679



     "So by the process of exclusion we arrive at the fact that he made
     his way towards Charlington Hall, which, as I understand, is situated
     in its own grounds on one side of the road. Anything else?"

==>      "Nothing, Mr. Holmes, save that I was so perplexed that I felt I <==
     should not be happy until I had seen you and had your advice."

     Holmes sat in silence for some little time.

     "Where is the gentleman to whom you are engaged?" he asked, at last.

[line number in individual story] matching line = 213    window = 208 218

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 34677    window = 34672 34682


     in its own grounds on one side of the road. Anything else?"

     "Nothing, Mr. Holmes, save that I was so perplexed that I felt I
     should not be happy until I had seen you and had your advice."

==>      Holmes sat in silence for some little time. <==

     "Where is the gentleman to whom you are engaged?" he asked, at last.

     "He is in the Midland Electrical Company, at Coventry."

     "He is in the Midland Electrical Company, at Coventry."

     "He would not pay you a surprise visit?"

==>      "Oh, Mr. Holmes! As if I should not know him!" <==

     "Have you had any other admirers?"

     "Several before I knew Cyril."

     "No one else?"

     Our fair client seemed a little confused.

==>      "Who was he?" asked Holmes. <==

     "Oh, it may be a mere fancy of mine; but it has seemed to me
     sometimes that my employer, Mr. Carruthers, takes a great deal of
     interest in me. We are thrown rather together. I play his
     accompaniments in the evening. He has never said anything. He is a

     sometimes that my employer, Mr. Carruthers, takes a great deal of
     interest in me. We are thrown rather together. I play his
     accompaniments in the evening. He has never said anything. He is a
     perfect gentleman. But a girl always knows."

==>      "Ha!" Holmes looked grave. "What does he do for a living?" <==

     "He is a rich man."

     "No carriages or horses?"


[line number in individual story] matching line = 260    window = 255 265

     busy just now, but I will find time to make some inquiries into your
     case. In the meantime take no step without letting me know. Good-bye,
     and I trust that we shall have nothing but good news from you."

     "It is part of the settled order of Nature that such a girl should
==>      have followers," said Holmes, as he pulled at his meditative pipe, <==
     "but for choice not on bicycles in lonely country roads. Some
     secretive lover, beyond all doubt. But there are curious and
     suggestive details about the case, Watson."

     "That he should appear only at that point?"

     been let about a month ago. Mr. Williamson was the name of the
     tenant. He was a respectable elderly gentleman. The polite agent was
     afraid he could say no more, as the affairs of his clients were not
     matters which he could discuss.

==>      Mr. Sherlock Holmes listened with attention to the long report which <==
     I was able to present to him that evening, but it did not elicit that
     word of curt praise which I had hoped for and should have valued. On
     the contrary, his austere face was even more severe than usual as he
     commented upon the things that I had done and the things that I had
     not.

     Next morning we had a note from Miss Smith, recounting shortly and
     accurately the very incidents which I had seen, but the pith of the
     letter lay in the postscript:

==>      "I am sure that you will respect my confidence, Mr. Holmes, when I <==
     tell you that my place here has become difficult owing to the fact
     that my employer has proposed marriage to me. I am convinced that his
     feelings are most deep and most honourable. At the same time my
     promise is, of course, given. He took my refusal very seriously, but
     also very gently. You can understand, however, that the situation is

[line number in individual story] matching line = 393    window = 388 398

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 34857    window = 34852 34862


     feelings are most deep and most honourable. At the same time my
     promise is, of course, given. He took my refusal very seriously, but
     also very gently. You can understand, however, that the situation is
     a little strained."

==>      "Our young friend seems to be getting into deep waters," said Holmes, <==
     thoughtfully, as he finished the letter. "The case certainly presents
     more features of interest and more possibility of development than I
     had originally thought. I should be none the worse for a quiet,
     peaceful day in the country, and I am inclined to run down this
     afternoon and test one or two theories which I have formed."

     more features of interest and more possibility of development than I
     had originally thought. I should be none the worse for a quiet,
     peaceful day in the country, and I am inclined to run down this
     afternoon and test one or two theories which I have formed."

==>      Holmes's quiet day in the country had a singular termination, for he <==
     arrived at Baker Street late in the evening with a cut lip and a
     discoloured lump upon his forehead, besides a general air of
     dissipation which would have made his own person the fitting object
     of a Scotland Yard investigation. He was immensely tickled by his own
     adventures, and laughed heartily as he recounted them.

     day on the Surrey border has not been much more profitable than your
     own."

     The Thursday brought us another letter from our client.

==>      You will not be surprised, Mr. Holmes [said she] to hear that I am <==
     leaving Mr. Carruthers's employment. Even the high pay cannot
     reconcile me to the discomforts of my situation. On Saturday I come
     up to town and I do not intend to return. Mr. Carruthers has got a
     trap, and so the dangers of the lonely road, if there ever were any
     dangers, are now over.

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 34924    window = 34919 34929


     sooner have a savage wild animal loose about the place. I loathe and
     fear him more than I can say. How can Mr. Carruthers endure such a
     creature for a moment? However, all my troubles will be over on
     Saturday.

==>      "So I trust, Watson; so I trust," said Holmes, gravely. "There is <==
     some deep intrigue going on round that little woman, and it is our
     duty to see that no one molests her upon that last journey. I think,
     Watson, that we must spare time to run down together on Saturday
     morning, and make sure that this curious and inconclusive
     investigation has no untoward ending."

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 34942    window = 34937 34947


     Woodley was a very different person, but, except on one occasion, he
     had not molested our client, and now he visited the house of
     Carruthers without intruding upon her presence. The man on the
     bicycle was doubtless a member of those week-end parties at the Hall
     of which the publican had spoken; but who he was or what he wanted
==>      was as obscure as ever. It was the severity of Holmes's manner and <==
     the fact that he slipped a revolver into his pocket before leaving
     our rooms which impressed me with the feeling that tragedy might
     prove to lurk behind this curious train of events.

     A rainy night had been followed by a glorious morning, and the

[line number in individual story] matching line = 486    window = 481 491

     prove to lurk behind this curious train of events.

     A rainy night had been followed by a glorious morning, and the
     heath-covered country-side with the glowing clumps of flowering gorse
     seemed all the more beautiful to eyes which were weary of the duns
==>      and drabs and slate-greys of London. Holmes and I walked along the <==
     broad, sandy road inhaling the fresh morning air, and rejoicing in
     the music of the birds and the fresh breath of the spring. From a
     rise of the road on the shoulder of Crooksbury Hill we could see the
     grim Hall bristling out from amidst the ancient oaks, which, old as
     they were, were still younger than the building which they

     broad, sandy road inhaling the fresh morning air, and rejoicing in
     the music of the birds and the fresh breath of the spring. From a
     rise of the road on the shoulder of Crooksbury Hill we could see the
     grim Hall bristling out from amidst the ancient oaks, which, old as
     they were, were still younger than the building which they

     reddish yellow band, between the brown of the heath and the budding
     green of the woods. Far away, a black dot, we could see a vehicle
     moving in our direction. Holmes gave an exclamation of impatience.

     "I had given a margin of half an hour," said he. "If that is her trap

     grim Hall bristling out from amidst the ancient oaks, which, old as
     they were, were still younger than the building which they
     surrounded. Holmes pointed down the long tract of road which wound, a
     reddish yellow band, between the brown of the heath and the budding
     green of the woods. Far away, a black dot, we could see a vehicle

     "I had given a margin of half an hour," said he. "If that is her trap
     she must be making for the earlier train. I fear, Watson, that she
     will be past Charlington before we can possibly meet her."


[line number in individual story] matching line = 504    window = 499 509

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 34968    window = 34963 34973


     will be past Charlington before we can possibly meet her."

     From the instant that we passed the rise we could no longer see the
     vehicle, but we hastened onwards at such a pace that my sedentary
     life began to tell upon me, and I was compelled to fall behind.
==>      Holmes, however, was always in training, for he had inexhaustible <==
     stores of nervous energy upon which to draw. His springy step never
     slowed until suddenly, when he was a hundred yards in front of me, he
     halted, and I saw him throw up his hand with a gesture of grief and
     despair. At the same instant an empty dog-cart, the horse cantering,
     the reins trailing, appeared round the curve of the road and rattled

     halted, and I saw him throw up his hand with a gesture of grief and
     despair. At the same instant an empty dog-cart, the horse cantering,
     the reins trailing, appeared round the curve of the road and rattled
     swiftly towards us.

==>      "Too late, Watson; too late!" cried Holmes, as I ran panting to his <==
     side. "Fool that I was not to allow for that earlier train! It's
     abduction, Watson--abduction! Murder! Heaven knows what! Block the
     road! Stop the horse! That's right. Now, jump in, and let us see if I
     can repair the consequences of my own blunder."

     can repair the consequences of my own blunder."

==>      We had sprung into the dog-cart, and Holmes, after turning the horse, <==
     gave it a sharp cut with the whip, and we flew back along the road.
     As we turned the curve the whole stretch of road between the Hall and
     the heath was opened up. I grasped Holmes's arm.

     "That's the man!" I gasped.

     A solitary cyclist was coming towards us. His head was down and his

     "Halloa! Stop there!" he shouted, holding his bicycle to block our
     road. "Where did you get that dog-cart? Pull up, man!" he yelled,
     drawing a pistol from his side pocket. "Pull up, I say, or, by
     George, I'll put a bullet into your horse."

==>      Holmes threw the reins into my lap and sprang down from the cart. <==

     "You're the man we want to see. Where is Miss Violet Smith?" he said,
     in his quick, clear way.

     "That's what I am asking you. You're in her dog-cart. You ought to

     blackguard parson. Come, man, come, if you really are her friend.
     Stand by me and we'll save her, if I have to leave my carcass in
     Charlington Wood."

     He ran distractedly, his pistol in his hand, towards a gap in the
==>      hedge. Holmes followed him, and I, leaving the horse grazing beside <==
     the road, followed Holmes.

     "This is where they came through," said he, pointing to the marks of
     several feet upon the muddy path. "Halloa! Stop a minute! Who's this
     in the bush?"

     He ran distractedly, his pistol in his hand, towards a gap in the
     hedge. Holmes followed him, and I, leaving the horse grazing beside

     "This is where they came through," said he, pointing to the marks of
     several feet upon the muddy path. "Halloa! Stop a minute! Who's this

     a woman."

     We ran frantically down the path, which wound among the trees. We had

     up.

     "They didn't go to the house. Here are their marks on the left--here,

     "Come on!" cried our guide; "come on!" He rushed across the glade,

     against the trunk of the tree for support. Williamson, the

     advanced with a shout of brutal and exultant laughter.

     back, his hideous red face turning suddenly to a dreadful mottled
     pallor. The old man, still clad in his surplice, burst into such a
