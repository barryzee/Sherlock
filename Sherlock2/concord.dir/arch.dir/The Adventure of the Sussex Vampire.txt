==>      Holmes had read carefully a note which the last post had brought him. <==
      Then, with the dry chuckle which was his nearest approach to a
     laugh, he tossed it over to me.

     "For a mixture of the modern and the mediaeval, of the practical and
     of the wildly fanciful, I think this is surely the limit," said he.

     "Matilda Briggs was not the name of a young woman, Watson," said
==>      Holmes in a reminiscent voice. "It was a ship which is associated <==
     with the giant rat of Sumatra, a story for which the world is not yet
     prepared. But what do we know about vampires? Does it come within our
     purview either? Anything is better than stagnation, but really we
     seem to have been switched on to a Grimms' fairy tale. Make a long
     arm, Watson, and see what V has to say."

     I leaned back and took down the great index volume to which he
==>      referred. Holmes balanced it on his knee, and his eyes moved slowly <==
     and lovingly over the record of old cases, mixed with the accumulated
     information of a lifetime.

     "Voyage of the Gloria Scott," he read.  "That was a bad business. I
     have some recollection that you made a record of it, Watson, though I

     "Not very far, eh? And Cheeseman's?"

==>      "I know that country, Holmes. It is full of old houses which are <==
     named after the men who built them centuries ago. You get Odley's and
     Harvey's and Carriton's--the folk are forgotten but their names live
     in their houses.

     his proud, self-contained nature that though he docketed any fresh
     information very quietly and accurately in his brain, he seldom made
     any acknowledgment to the giver. "I rather fancy we shall know a good
     deal more about Cheeseman's, Lamberley, before we are through. The

     "You had better read it."

     He handed the letter across. It was headed with the address quoted.

==>      Dear Mr. Holmes [it said]: <==
     I have been recommended to you by my lawyers, but indeed the matter
     is so extraordinarily delicate that it is most difficult to discuss.
     It concerns a friend for whom I am acting. This gentleman married
     some five years ago a Peruvian lady, the daughter of a Peruvian
     merchant, whom he had met in connection with the importation of

     upon her stepson, a loving mother. Why, then, should she wound her
     own dear little baby? He told the nurse that she was dreaming, that
     her suspicions were those of a lunatic, and that such libels upon her
     mistress were not to be tolerated.  While they were talking a sudden
     cry of pain was heard. Nurse and master rushed together to the
==>      nursery. Imagine his feelings, Mr. Holmes, as he saw his wife rise <==
     from a kneeling position beside the cot and saw blood upon the
     child's exposed neck and upon the sheet. With a cry of horror, he
     turned his wife's face to the light and saw blood all round her lips.
     It was she--she beyond all question--who had drunk the poor baby's
     blood.

     "Of course I remembered him," said I as I laid down the letter. "Big
     Bob Ferguson, the finest three-quarter Richmond ever had. He was
     always a good-natured chap. It's like him to be so concerned over a
     friend's case."

==>      Holmes looked at me thoughtfully and shook his head. <==

     "I never get your limits, Watson," said he.  "There are unexplored
     possibilities about you. Take a wire down, like a good fellow. 'Will
     examine your case with pleasure.'"

     "Hullo, Watson," said he, and his voice was still deep and hearty.
     "You don't look quite the man you did when I threw you over the ropes
     into the crowd at the Old Deer Park. I expect I have changed a bit
     also. But it's this last day or two that has aged me. I see by your

     very far from being at my wit's end, and that I am confident we shall
     find some solution.  First of all, tell me what steps you have taken.
     Is your wife still near the children?"

==>      "We had a dreadful scene. She is a most loving woman, Mr.  Holmes. If <==
     ever a woman loved a man with all her heart and soul, she loves me.
     She was cut to the heart that I should have discovered this horrible,
     this incredible, secret. She would not even speak. She gave no answer
     to my reproaches, save to gaze at me with a sort of wild, despairing
     look in her eyes. Then she rushed to her room and locked herself in.

     "No, she struck him savagely. It is the more terrible as he is a poor

     spoke of his boy. "You would think that the dear lad's condition
     would soften anyone's heart. A fall in childhood and a twisted spine,

     "Then your wife's character would really be better known by Dolores
     than by you?"

     "Yes, you may say so."

==>      Holmes made a note. <==

     "I fancy," said he, "that I may be of more use at Lamberley than
     here. It is eminently a case for personal investigation. If the lady
     remains in her room, our presence could not annoy or inconvenience
     her. Of course, we would stay at the inn."

     Ferguson gave a gesture of relief.

     "Yet you say he is affectionate?"

     "Never in the world could there be so devoted a son. My life is his
     life. He is absorbed in what I say or do."

     "No doubt you and the boy were great comrades before this second
     marriage. You were thrown very close together, were you not?"

     "Very much so."

     "That certainly complicates matters."

     "Possibly not. One forms provisional theories and waits for time or
     fuller knowledge to explode them. A bad habit, Mr. Ferguson, but
     human nature is weak. I fear that your old friend here has given an
     exaggerated view of my scientific methods. However, I will only say

     ornamented, however, on the lower part by a line of well-chosen
     modern water-colours; while above, where yellow plaster took the
     place of oak, there was hung a fine collection of South American
     utensils and weapons, which had been brought, no doubt, by the

     sprang from his eager mind, and examined them with some care. He
     returned with his eyes full of thought.

     "Hullo!" he cried. "Hullo!"

     A spaniel had lain in a basket in the corner. It came slowly forward
     towards its master, walking with difficulty. Its hind legs moved
     irregularly and its tail was on the ground. It licked Ferguson's

     "Please God you may! If you will excuse me, gentlemen, I will go up
     to my wife's room and see if there has been any change."

     of the curiosities upon the wall. When our host returned it was clear
     from his downcast face that he had made no progress. He brought with
     him a tall, slim, brown-faced girl.

     Ferguson gently disengaged himself from the embrace with some little
     show of embarrassment.

     make the acquaintance of the baby?"

     "Ask Mrs. Mason to bring baby down," said Ferguson.  The boy went off
     with a curious, shambling gait which told my surgical eyes that he
     was suffering from a weak spine. Presently he returned, and behind

     glanced down at the small, angry red pucker upon the cherub throat.

     most singular intentness in his expression. His face was as set as if
     it had been carved out of old ivory, and his eyes, which had glanced
     for a moment at father and child, were now fixed with eager curiosity
     upon something at the other side of the room.  Following his gaze I

     melancholy, dripping garden. It is true that a shutter had half
     closed outside and obstructed the view, but none the less it was

     attention. Then he smiled, and his eyes came back to the baby. On its
     chubby neck there was this small puckered mark. Without speaking,
     Holmes examined it with care. Finally he shook one of the dimpled
     fists which waved in front of him.

     He took her aside and spoke earnestly for a few minutes. I only heard
     the last words, which were: "Your anxiety will soon, I hope, be set

     creature, withdrew with the child.

     "Not very prepossessing externally, as you can see, but a heart of
     gold, and devoted to the child."

     The boy cooed and nestled his head upon his father's breast. Ferguson
     gently disengaged him.

     "Run away, little Jacky," said he, and he watched his son with loving

     boy was gone, "I really feel that I have brought you on a fool's
     errand, for what can you possibly do save give me your sympathy? It
     must be an exceedingly delicate and complex affair from your point of
     view."

     Ferguson put his big hand to his furrowed forehead.

==>      "For heaven's sake, Holmes," he said hoarsely; "if you can see the <==
     truth in this matter, do not keep me in suspense. How do I stand? 
     What shall I do? I care nothing as to how you have found your facts
     so long as you have really got them."

     "Very good. It is only in her presence that we can clear the matter

     "She will not see me," cried Ferguson.

     sheet of paper. "You at least have the entree, Watson. Will you have
     the goodness to give the lady this note?"

     I ascended again and handed the note to Dolores, who cautiously
     opened the door. A minute later I heard a cry from within, a cry in

     opened the door. A minute later I heard a cry from within, a cry in
     which joy and surprise seemed to be blended. Dolores looked out.

     "She will see them. She will leesten," said she.

==>      At my summons Ferguson and Holmes came up. As we entered the room <==
     Ferguson took a step or two towards his wife, who had raised herself
     in the bed, but she held out her hand to repulse him. He sank into an
     armchair, while Holmes seated himself beside him, after bowing to the
     lady, who looked at him with wide-eyed amazement.

     be short and direct.  The swiftest surgery is the least painful. Let

     Ferguson sat up with a cry of joy.

     "I will do so, but in doing so I must wound you deeply in another
     direction."

     was better that I should wait and that it should come from some other
     lips than mine. When this gentleman, who seems to have powers of
     magic, wrote that he knew all, I was glad."

     "I think a year at sea would be my prescription for Master Jacky,"
==>      said Holmes, rising from his chair. "Only one thing is still clouded, <==
     madame. We can quite understand your attacks upon Master Jacky. There
     is a limit to a mother's patience. But how did you dare to leave the
     child these last two days?"

     "I had told Mrs. Mason. She knew."

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 70216    window = 70211 70221


     "Exactly. So I imagined."

     Ferguson was standing by the bed, choking, his hands outstretched and
     quivering.

==>      "This, I fancy, is the time for our exit, Watson," said Holmes in a <==
     whisper. "If you will take one elbow of the too faithful Dolores, I
     will take the other. There, now," he added as he closed the door
     behind him, "I think we may leave them to settle the rest among
     themselves."

     will take the other. There, now," he added as he closed the door

     I have only one further note of this case. It is the letter which
==>      Holmes wrote in final answer to that with which the narrative begins. <==
     It ran thus:

     Baker Street,
     Nov. 21st.

      Then, with the dry chuckle which was his nearest approach to a
     laugh, he tossed it over to me.

     "For a mixture of the modern and the mediaeval, of the practical and
     of the wildly fanciful, I think this is surely the limit," said he.

     I read as follows:

     I leaned back and took down the great index volume to which he
     referred. Holmes balanced it on his knee, and his eyes moved slowly
     and lovingly over the record of old cases, mixed with the accumulated
     information of a lifetime.

     referred. Holmes balanced it on his knee, and his eyes moved slowly

     expression of intense interest and concentration. When he had
     finished he sat for some little time lost in thought with the letter
     dangling from his fingers. Finally, with a start, he aroused himself
     from his reverie.

     "It is in Sussex, south of Horsham."

     you see me? Will you use your great powers in aiding a distracted

     Yours faithfully,
     Robert Ferguson.
==>      P. S. I believe your friend Watson played Rugby for Blackheath when I <==
     was three-quarter for Richmond. It is the only personal introduction
     which I can give.

     always a good-natured chap. It's like him to be so concerned over a
     friend's case."

     Holmes looked at me thoughtfully and shook his head.

==>      "I never get your limits, Watson," said he.  "There are unexplored <==
     possibilities about you. Take a wire down, like a good fellow. 'Will

     There is surely nothing in life more painful than to meet the wreck
     of a fine athlete whom one has known in his prime. His great frame
     had fallen in, his flaxen hair was scanty, and his shoulders were
     bowed. I fear that I roused corresponding emotions in him.

==>      "Hullo, Watson," said he, and his voice was still deep and hearty. <==
     "You don't look quite the man you did when I threw you over the ropes
     into the crowd at the Old Deer Park. I expect I have changed a bit
     also. But it's this last day or two that has aged me. I see by your

     from Victoria if you could come."

     "Of course we could come. There is a lull at present. I can give you

     are one or two points upon which I wish to be very sure before I

     Ferguson looked at me with a question in his eyes.

     "I should be so glad if I could be of use."

     "I take him. I no ask leave. She needs doctor."

     Ferguson gently disengaged himself from the embrace with some little
     show of embarrassment.

     "Dear old chap," said he, patting the flaxen head with a very tender
==>      hand. "I came early because my friends, Mr. Holmes and Dr. Watson, <==
     have been persuaded to come down and spend an evening with us."

     "Is that Mr. Holmes, the detective?"

     "She is ill, but she is quite rational."

     "Very good. It is only in her presence that we can clear the matter
