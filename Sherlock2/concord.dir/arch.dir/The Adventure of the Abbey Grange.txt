     It was on a bitterly cold and frosty morning during the winter of '97
==>      that I was awakened by a tugging at my shoulder. It was Holmes. The <==
     candle in his hand shone upon his eager, stooping face and told me at
     a glance that something was amiss.

     "Come, Watson, come!" he cried. "The game is afoot. Not a word! Into
     your clothes and come!"

     Ten minutes later we were both in a cab and rattling through the
     silent streets on our way to Charing Cross Station. The first faint
     winter's dawn was beginning to appear, and we could dimly see the
     occasional figure of an early workman as he passed us, blurred and
==>      indistinct in the opalescent London reek. Holmes nestled in silence <==
     into his heavy coat, and I was glad to do the same, for the air was
     most bitter and neither of us had broken our fast. It was not until
     we had consumed some hot tea at the station, and taken our places in
     the Kentish train, that we were sufficiently thawed, he to speak and
     I to listen. Holmes drew a note from his pocket and read it aloud:

     Except for releasing the lady I will see that everything is kept

     it is difficult to leave Sir Eustace there.

     "Hopkins has called me in seven times, and on each occasion his

     every one of his cases has found its way into your collection, and I
     must admit, Watson, that you have some power of selection which
     atones for much which I deplore in your narratives. Your fatal habit
     of looking at everything from the point of view of a story instead of
     as a scientific exercise has ruined what might have been an

     carried out, and one wing of the house appeared to be entirely new.
     The youthful figure and alert, eager face of Inspector Stanley
     Hopkins confronted us in the open doorway.

==>      "I'm very glad you have come, Mr. Holmes. And you too, Dr. Watson! <==
     But, indeed, if I had my time over again I should not have troubled
     you, for since the lady has come to herself she has given so clear an
     account of the affair that there is not much left for us to do. You
     remember that Lewisham gang of burglars?"

     "I thought they had better hear your ladyship's story first."

     "I shall be glad when you can arrange matters. It is horrible to me
     to think of him still lying there." She shuddered and buried her face
     in her hands. As she did so the loose gown fell back from her
==>      forearms. Holmes uttered an exclamation. <==

     "You have other injuries, madam! What is this?" Two vivid red spots
     stood out on one of the white, round limbs. She hastily covered it.

     "It is nothing. It has no connection with the hideous business of

     other servants were soon alarmed, and we sent for the local police,
     who instantly communicated with London. That is really all that I can
     tell you, gentlemen, and I trust that it will not be necessary for me
     to go over so painful a story again."

==>      "Any questions, Mr. Holmes?" asked Hopkins. <==

     "I will not impose any further tax upon Lady Brackenstall's patience
     and time," said Holmes. "Before I go into the dining-room I should
     like to hear your experience." He looked at the maid.

     like to hear your experience." He looked at the maid.

     "I saw the men before ever they came into the house," said she. "As I
     sat by my bedroom window I saw three men in the moonlight down by the
     lodge gate yonder, but I thought nothing of it at the time. It was

     "She has been with her all her life," said Hopkins. "Nursed her as a
     baby, and came with her to England when they first left Australia
     eighteen months ago. Theresa Wright is her name, and the kind of maid

     The keen interest had passed out of Holmes's expressive face, and I
     knew that with the mystery all the charm of the case had departed.
     There still remained an arrest to be effected, but what were these
     commonplace rogues that he should soil his hands with them? An

     expression. He had evidently been in his bed when the alarm had
     broken out, for he wore a foppish embroidered night-shirt, and his
     bare feet projected from his trousers. His head was horribly injured,
     and the whole room bore witness to the savage ferocity of the blow
     which had struck him down. Beside him lay the heavy poker, bent into
==>      a curve by the concussion. Holmes examined both it and the <==
     indescribable wreck which it had wrought.

     "He must be a powerful man, this elder Randall," he remarked.

     "Yes," said Hopkins. "I have some record of the fellow, and he is a

     worse--and that was only hushed up with difficulty. Then he threw a
     decanter at that maid, Theresa Wright; there was trouble about that.
     On the whole, and between ourselves, it will be a brighter house
     without him. What are you looking at now?"

==>      Holmes was down on his knees examining with great attention the knots <==
     upon the red cord with which the lady had been secured. Then he
     carefully scrutinized the broken and frayed end where it had snapped
     off when the burglar had dragged it down.

     "When this was pulled down the bell in the kitchen must have rung

     house."

     "How did the burglar know no one would hear it? How dared he pull at
     a bell-rope in that reckless fashion?"

==>      "Exactly, Mr. Holmes, exactly. You put the very question which I have <==
     asked myself again and again. There can be no doubt that this fellow
     must have known the house and its habits. He must have perfectly
     understood that the servants would all be in bed at that
     comparatively early hour, and that no one could possibly hear a bell
     ring in the kitchen. Therefore he must have been in close league with

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 42493    window = 42488 42498


     comparatively early hour, and that no one could possibly hear a bell
     ring in the kitchen. Therefore he must have been in close league with
     one of the servants. Surely that is evident. But there are eight
     servants, and all of good character."

==>      "Other things being equal," said Holmes, "one would suspect the one <==
     at whose head the master threw a decanter. And yet that would involve
     treachery towards the mistress to whom this woman seems devoted.
     Well, well, the point is a minor one, and when you have Randall you
     will probably find no difficulty in securing his accomplice. The
     lady's story certainly seems to be corroborated, if it needed

     wine, and one of them containing some dregs of bees-wing. The bottle
     stood near them, two-thirds full, and beside it lay a long,
     deeply-stained cork. Its appearance and the dust upon the bottle
     showed that it was no common vintage which the murderers had enjoyed.

==>      A change had come over Holmes's manner. He had lost his listless <==
     expression, and again I saw an alert light of interest in his keen,
     deep-set eyes. He raised the cork and examined it minutely.

     "How did they draw it?" he asked.

     when Randall is arrested, and any further developments which may
     occur. I trust that I shall soon have to congratulate you upon a
     successful conclusion. Come, Watson, I fancy that we may employ
     ourselves more profitably at home."

==>      During our return journey I could see by Holmes's face that he was <==
     much puzzled by something which he had observed. Every now and then,
     by an effort, he would throw off the impression and talk as if the
     matter were clear, but then his doubts would settle down upon him
     again, and his knitted brows and abstracted eyes would show that his
     thoughts had gone back once more to the great dining-room of the

     construct our case for ourselves without any help from them. That is
     the mission which now lies before us, and here, Watson, is the
     Chislehurst train."

     The household of the Abbey Grange were much surprised at our return,
==>      but Sherlock Holmes, finding that Stanley Hopkins had gone off to <==
     report to head-quarters, took possession of the dining-room, locked
     the door upon the inside, and devoted himself for two hours to one of
     those minute and laborious investigations which formed the solid
     basis on which his brilliant edifices of deduction were reared.
     Seated in a corner like an interested student who observes the

     demonstration of his professor, I followed every step of that
     remarkable research. The window, the curtains, the carpet, the chair,
     the rope--each in turn was minutely examined and duly pondered. The
     body of the unfortunate baronet had been removed, but all else
     remained as we had seen it in the morning. Then, to my astonishment,
==>      Holmes climbed up on to the massive mantelpiece. Far above his head <==
     hung the few inches of red cord which were still attached to the
     wire. For a long time he gazed upward at it, and then in an attempt
     to get nearer to it he rested his knee upon a wooden bracket on the
     wall. This brought his hand within a few inches of the broken end of
     the rope, but it was not this so much as the bracket itself which

     our Marengo, for it begins in defeat and ends in victory. I should
     like now to have a few words with the nurse Theresa. We must be wary
     for awhile, if we are to get the information which we want."

     She was an interesting person, this stern Australian nurse. Taciturn,
==>      suspicious, ungracious, it took some time before Holmes's pleasant <==
     manner and frank acceptance of all that she said thawed her into a
     corresponding amiability. She did not attempt to conceal her hatred
     for her late employer.

     "Yes, sir, it is true that he threw the decanter at me. I heard him

     more to foment the bruise upon her mistress's brow.

     "I hope," said the lady, "that you have not come to cross-examine me
     again?"

==>      "No," Holmes answered, in his gentlest voice, "I will not cause you <==
     any unnecessary trouble, Lady Brackenstall, and my whole desire is to
     make things easy for you, for I am convinced that you are a
     much-tried woman. If you will treat me as a friend and trust me you
     may find that I will justify your trust."

     "What do you want me to do?"

     "To tell me the truth."

==>      "Mr. Holmes!" <==

     "No, no, Lady Brackenstall, it is no use. You may have heard of any
     little reputation which I possess. I will stake it all on the fact
     that your story is an absolute fabrication."

     frightened eyes.

     "You are an impudent fellow!" cried Theresa. "Do you mean to say that
     my mistress has told a lie?"

     "I have told you everything."

     For an instant there was hesitation in her beautiful face. Then some
     new strong thought caused it to set like a mask.

     "I have told you all I know."

==>      Holmes took his hat and shrugged his shoulders. "I am sorry," he <==
     said, and without another word we left the room and the house. There
     was a pond in the park, and to this my friend led the way. It was
     frozen over, but a single hole was left for the convenience of a
     solitary swan. Holmes gazed at it and then passed on to the lodge
     gate. There he scribbled a short note for Stanley Hopkins and left it

     South Australia with England, but we will draw the larger cover

     he was not long in acquiring all the information which he needed. In
     June of '95 only one of their line had reached a home port. It was
     the Rock of Gibraltar, their largest and best boat. A reference to
     the passenger list showed that Miss Fraser of Adelaide, with her
     maid, had made the voyage in her. The boat was now on her way to

     Jack Croker, had been made a captain and was to take charge of their
     new ship, the Bass Rock, sailing in two days' time from Southampton.
     He lived at Sydenham, but he was likely to be in that morning for
     instructions, if we cared to wait for him.

==>      No; Mr. Holmes had no desire to see him, but would be glad to know <==
     more about his record and character.

     His record was magnificent. There was not an officer in the fleet to
     touch him. As to his character, he was reliable on duty, but a wild,
     desperate fellow off the deck of his ship, hot-headed, excitable, but

     desperate fellow off the deck of his ship, hot-headed, excitable, but
     loyal, honest, and kind-hearted. That was the pith of the information

     company. Thence he drove to Scotland Yard, but instead of entering he
     sat in his cab with his brows drawn down, lost in profound thought.
     Finally he drove round to the Charing Cross telegraph office, sent
     off a message, and then, at last, we made for Baker Street once more.

     Before evening we had a visit from Inspector Stanley Hopkins. Things
     were not going very well with him.

==>      "I believe that you are a wizard, Mr. Holmes. I really do sometimes <==
     think that you have powers that are not human. Now, how on earth
     could you know that the stolen silver was at the bottom of that
     pond?"

     "I didn't know it."

     "Ah, a hiding-place--that is better!" cried Stanley Hopkins. "Yes,
     yes, I see it all now! It was early, there were folk upon the roads,
     they were afraid of being seen with the silver, so they sank it in
     the pond, intending to return for it when the coast was clear.
==>      Excellent, Mr. Holmes--that is better than your idea of a blind." <==

     "Quite so; you have got an admirable theory. I have no doubt that my
     own ideas were quite wild, but you must admit that they have ended in
     discovering the silver."

     "Yes, sir, yes. It was all your doing. But I have had a bad
     set-back."

     "A set-back?"

==>      "Yes, Mr. Holmes. The Randall gang were arrested in New York this <==
     morning."

     "Dear me, Hopkins! That is certainly rather against your theory that
     they committed a murder in Kent last night."

     "Dear me, Hopkins! That is certainly rather against your theory that
     they committed a murder in Kent last night."

     gangs of three besides the Randalls, or it may be some new gang of
     which the police have never heard."

     "Quite so; it is perfectly possible. What, are you off?"

     "Quite so; it is perfectly possible. What, are you off?"

     bottom of the business. I suppose you have no hint to give me?"

     "I have given you one."

     "Ah, that's the question, of course. But I commend the idea to your
     mind. You might possibly find that there was something in it. You

     It was on a bitterly cold and frosty morning during the winter of '97
     that I was awakened by a tugging at my shoulder. It was Holmes. The
     candle in his hand shone upon his eager, stooping face and told me at
     a glance that something was amiss.

==>      "Come, Watson, come!" he cried. "The game is afoot. Not a word! Into <==
     your clothes and come!"

     Ten minutes later we were both in a cab and rattling through the
     silent streets on our way to Charing Cross Station. The first faint
     winter's dawn was beginning to appear, and we could dimly see the

     "Stanley Hopkins."

     "Hopkins has called me in seven times, and on each occasion his
     summons has been entirely justified," said Holmes. "I fancy that
     every one of his cases has found its way into your collection, and I
==>      must admit, Watson, that you have some power of selection which <==
     atones for much which I deplore in your narratives. Your fatal habit
     of looking at everything from the point of view of a story instead of
     as a scientific exercise has ruined what might have been an
     instructive and even classical series of demonstrations. You slur
     over work of the utmost finesse and delicacy in order to dwell upon

     sensational details which may excite, but cannot possibly instruct,
     the reader."

     "Why do you not write them yourself?" I said, with some bitterness.

==>      "I will, my dear Watson, I will. At present I am, as you know, fairly <==
     busy, but I propose to devote my declining years to the composition
     of a text-book which shall focus the whole art of detection into one
     volume. Our present research appears to be a case of murder."

     "You think this Sir Eustace is dead, then?"

     "I should say so. Hopkins's writing shows considerable agitation, and
     he is not an emotional man. Yes, I gather there has been violence,
     and that the body is left for our inspection. A mere suicide would
     not have caused him to send for me. As to the release of the lady, it
     would appear that she has been locked in her room during the tragedy.

     coat-of-arms, picturesque address. I think that friend Hopkins will
     live up to his reputation and that we shall have an interesting
     morning. The crime was committed before twelve last night."

     in ivy, but the large windows showed that modern changes had been
     carried out, and one wing of the house appeared to be entirely new.
     The youthful figure and alert, eager face of Inspector Stanley
     Hopkins confronted us in the open doorway.

==>      "I'm very glad you have come, Mr. Holmes. And you too, Dr. Watson! <==
     But, indeed, if I had my time over again I should not have troubled
     you, for since the lady has come to herself she has given so clear an
     account of the affair that there is not much left for us to do. You
     remember that Lewisham gang of burglars?"

     hand. Of course, it must be a mere chance about the glasses. Well,
     good morning, Hopkins. I don't see that I can be of any use to you,
     and you appear to have your case very clear. You will let me know
     when Randall is arrested, and any further developments which may
     occur. I trust that I shall soon have to congratulate you upon a
==>      successful conclusion. Come, Watson, I fancy that we may employ <==
     ourselves more profitably at home."

     During our return journey I could see by Holmes's face that he was
     much puzzled by something which he had observed. Every now and then,
     by an effort, he would throw off the impression and talk as if the

     after him.

     "Excuse me, my dear fellow," said he, as we watched the rear
     carriages of our train disappearing round a curve; "I am sorry to
     make you the victim of what may seem a mere whim, but on my life,
==>      Watson, I simply can't leave that case in this condition. Every <==
     instinct that I possess cries out against it. It's wrong--it's all
     wrong--I'll swear that it's wrong. And yet the lady's story was
     complete, the maid's corroboration was sufficient, the detail was
     fairly exact. What have I to put against that? Three wine-glasses,
     that is all. But if I had not taken things for granted, if I had

     fairly exact. What have I to put against that? Three wine-glasses,
     that is all. But if I had not taken things for granted, if I had
     examined everything with care which I would have shown had we
     approached the case de novo and had no cut-and-dried story to warp my
     mind, would I not then have found something more definite to go upon?
==>      Of course I should. Sit down on this bench, Watson, until a train for <==
     Chislehurst arrives, and allow me to lay the evidence before you,
     imploring you in the first instance to dismiss from your mind the
     idea that anything which the maid or her mistress may have said must
     necessarily be true. The lady's charming personality must not be
     permitted to warp our judgment.

     scream; it is unusual for them to commit murder when their numbers
     are sufficient to overpower one man; it is unusual for them to be
     content with a limited plunder when there is much more within their
     reach; and finally I should say that it was very unusual for such men
     to leave a bottle half empty. How do all these unusuals strike you,
==>      Watson?" <==

     "Their cumulative effect is certainly considerable, and yet each of
     them is quite possible in itself. The most unusual thing of all, as
     it seems to me, is that the lady should be tied to the chair."

     they must either kill her or else secure her in such a way that she
     could not give immediate notice of their escape. But at any rate I
     have shown, have I not, that there is a certain element of
     improbability about the lady's story? And now on the top of this
     comes the incident of the wine-glasses."

     the exceedingly remarkable, for it can only mean that Lady
     Brackenstall and her maid have deliberately lied to us, that not one
     word of their story is to be believed, that they have some very
     strong reason for covering the real criminal, and that we must
     construct our case for ourselves without any help from them. That is

     Chislehurst train."

     The household of the Abbey Grange were much surprised at our return,
     but Sherlock Holmes, finding that Stanley Hopkins had gone off to
     report to head-quarters, took possession of the dining-room, locked

     the rope, but it was not this so much as the bracket itself which
     seemed to engage his attention. Finally he sprang down with an
     ejaculation of satisfaction.

     most remarkable in our collection. But, dear me, how slow-witted I
     have been, and how nearly I have committed the blunder of my

     height, active as a squirrel, dexterous with his fingers; finally,
