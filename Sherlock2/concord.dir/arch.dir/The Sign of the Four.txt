==>      Sherlock Holmes took his bottle from the corner of the mantelpiece <==
     and his hypodermic syringe from its neat morocco case. With his long,
     white, nervous fingers he adjusted the delicate needle, and rolled
     back his left shirt-cuff. For some little time his eyes rested
     thoughtfully upon the sinewy forearm and wrist all dotted and scarred
     with innumerable puncture-marks. Finally he thrust the sharp point

     vanity underlay my companion's quiet and didactic manner. I made no
     remark, however, but sat nursing my wounded leg. I had a Jezail
     bullet through it some time before, and, though it did not prevent me
     from walking, it ached wearily at every change of the weather.

==>      "My practice has extended recently to the Continent," said Holmes, <==
     after a while, filling up his old brier-root pipe. "I was consulted
     last week by Francois Le Villard, who, as you probably know, has come
     rather to the front lately in the French detective service. He has
     all the Celtic power of quick intuition, but he is deficient in the
     wide range of exact knowledge which is essential to the higher

     with stray magnifiques, coup-de-maÃ®tres and tours-de-force, all
     testifying to the ardent admiration of the Frenchman.

     "He speaks as a pupil to his master," said I.

==>      "Oh, he rates my assistance too highly," said Sherlock Holmes, <==
     lightly. "He has considerable gifts himself. He possesses two out of
     the three qualities necessary for the ideal detective. He has the
     power of observation and that of deduction. He is only wanting in
     knowledge; and that may come in time. He is now translating my small
     works into French."

     and finally, taking to drink, he died. That is all I can gather."

     I sprang from my chair and limped impatiently about the room with
     considerable bitterness in my heart.

==>      "This is unworthy of you, Holmes," I said. "I could not have believed <==
     that you would have descended to this. You have made inquires into
     the history of my unhappy brother, and you now pretend to deduce this
     knowledge in some fanciful way. You cannot expect me to believe that
     you have read all this from his old watch! It is unkind, and, to
     speak plainly, has a touch of charlatanism in it."

     her expression was sweet and amiable, and her large blue eyes were
     singularly spiritual and sympathetic. In an experience of women which
     extends over many nations and three separate continents, I have never
     looked upon a face which gave a clearer promise of a refined and
     sensitive nature. I could not but observe that as she took the seat
==>      which Sherlock Holmes placed for her, her lip trembled, her hand <==
     quivered, and she showed every sign of intense inward agitation.

     "I have come to you, Mr. Holmes," she said, "because you once enabled
     my employer, Mrs. Cecil Forrester, to unravel a little domestic
     complication. She was much impressed by your kindness and skill."

     "Mrs. Cecil Forrester," he repeated thoughtfully. "I believe that I
     was of some slight service to her. The case, however, as I remember

     "She did not think so. But at least you cannot say the same of mine.
     I can hardly imagine anything more strange, more utterly
     inexplicable, than the situation in which I find myself."

==>      Holmes rubbed his hands, and his eyes glistened. He leaned forward in <==
     his chair with an expression of extraordinary concentration upon his
     clear-cut, hawklike features. "State your case," said he, in brisk,
     business tones.

     I felt that my position was an embarrassing one. "You will, I am

     inquiries let to no result; and from that day to this no word has
     ever been heard of my unfortunate father. He came home with his heart
     full of hope, to find some peace, some comfort, and instead--" She
     put her hand to her throat, and a choking sob cut short the sentence.

==>      "The date?" asked Holmes, opening his note-book. <==

     "He disappeared upon the 3d of December, 1878,--nearly ten years
     ago."

     "His luggage?"

     "Only one that we know of,--Major Sholto, of his own regiment, the
     34th Bombay Infantry. The major had retired some little time before,
     and lived at Upper Norwood. We communicated with him, of course, but
     he did not even know that his brother officer was in England."

==>      "A singular case," remarked Holmes. <==

     "I have not yet described to you the most singular part. About six
     years ago--to be exact, upon the 4th of May, 1882--an advertisement
     appeared in the Times asking for the address of Miss Mary Morstan and
     stating that it would be to her advantage to come forward. There was

     by an expert to be of a rare variety and of considerable value. You
     can see for yourselves that they are very handsome." She opened a
     flat box as she spoke, and showed me six of the finest pearls that I
     had ever seen.

==>      "Your statement is most interesting," said Sherlock Holmes.  "Has <==
     anything else occurred to you?"

     "Yes, and no later than to-day. That is why I have come to you.  This
     morning I received this letter, which you will perhaps read for
     yourself."

[line number in individual story] matching line = 432    window = 427 437

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 5121    window = 5116 5126



     "Yes, and no later than to-day. That is why I have come to you.  This
     morning I received this letter, which you will perhaps read for
     yourself."

==>      "Thank you," said Holmes. "The envelope too, please. Postmark, <==
     London, S.W. Date, July 7. Hum! Man's thumb-mark on corner,--probably
     postman. Best quality paper. Envelopes at sixpence a packet.
     Particular man in his stationery. No address. 'Be at the third pillar

     "You are both very kind," she answered. "I have led a retired life,
     and have no friends whom I could appeal to. If I am here at six it
     will do, I suppose?"

==>      "You must not be later," said Holmes. "There is one other point, <==
     however. Is this handwriting the same as that upon the pearl-box
     addresses?"

     "I have them here," she answered, producing half a dozen pieces of
     paper.

[line number in individual story] matching line = 513    window = 508 518

     of this fellow's scribble?"

     "It is legible and regular," I answered. "A man of business habits
     and some force of character."

==>      Holmes shook his head. "Look at his long letters," he said. "They <==
     hardly rise above the common herd. That d might be an a, and that l
     an e. Men of character always differentiate their long letters,
     however illegibly they may write. There is vacillation in his k's and
     self-esteem in his capitals. I am going out now. I have some few
     references to make. Let me recommend this book,--one of the most

     that I should dare to think of such things? She was a unit, a
     factor,--nothing more. If my future were black, it was better surely
     to face it like a man than to attempt to brighten it by mere
     will-o'-the-wisps of the imagination.

==>      It was half-past five before Holmes returned. He was bright, eager, <==
     and in excellent spirits,--a mood which in his case alternated with
     fits of the blackest depression.

     "There is no great mystery in this matter," he said, taking the cup
     of tea which I had poured out for him. "The facts appear to admit of

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 5242    window = 5237 5247


     fact, that is all. It is, however, very suggestive. The details are
     still to be added. I have just found, on consulting the back files of
     the Times, that Major Sholto, of Upper Norword, late of the 34th
     Bombay Infantry, died upon the 28th of April, 1882."

==>      "I may be very obtuse, Holmes, but I fail to see what this suggests." <==

     "No? You surprise me. Look at it in this way, then. Captain Morstan
     disappears. The only person in London whom he could have visited is
     Major Sholto. Major Sholto denies having heard that he was in London.
     Four years later Sholto dies. Within a week of his death Captain

     letter speaks of giving her justice. What justice can she have? It is
     too much to suppose that her father is still alive. There is no other
     injustice in her case that you know of."

     "There are difficulties; there are certainly difficulties," said
==>      Sherlock Holmes, pensively. "But our expedition of to-night will <==
     solve them all. Ah, here is a four-wheeler, and Miss Morstan is
     inside. Are you all ready? Then we had better go down, for it is a
     little past the hour."

     I picked up my hat and my heaviest stick, but I observed that Holmes

[line number in individual story] matching line = 579    window = 574 584

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 5268    window = 5263 5273


     Sherlock Holmes, pensively. "But our expedition of to-night will
     solve them all. Ah, here is a four-wheeler, and Miss Morstan is
     inside. Are you all ready? Then we had better go down, for it is a
     little past the hour."

==>      I picked up my hat and my heaviest stick, but I observed that Holmes <==
     took his revolver from his drawer and slipped it into his pocket. It
     was clear that he thought that our night's work might be a serious
     one.

     Miss Morstan was muffled in a dark cloak, and her sensitive face was

[line number in individual story] matching line = 588    window = 583 593

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 5277    window = 5272 5282



     Miss Morstan was muffled in a dark cloak, and her sensitive face was
     composed, but pale. She must have been more than woman if she did not
     feel some uneasiness at the strange enterprise upon which we were
     embarking, yet her self-control was perfect, and she readily answered
==>      the few additional questions which Sherlock Holmes put to her. <==

     "Major Sholto was a very particular friend of papa's," she said. "His
     letters were full of allusions to the major. He and papa were in
     command of the troops at the Andaman Islands, so they were thrown a
     great deal together. By the way, a curious paper was found in papa's

[line number in individual story] matching line = 598    window = 593 603

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 5287    window = 5282 5292


     great deal together. By the way, a curious paper was found in papa's
     desk which no one could understand. I don't suppose that it is of the
     slightest importance, but I thought you might care to see it, so I
     brought it with me. It is here."

==>      Holmes unfolded the paper carefully and smoothed it out upon his <==
     knee. He then very methodically examined it all over with his double
     lens.

     "It is paper of native Indian manufacture," he remarked. "It has at
     some time been pinned to a board. The diagram upon it appears to be a

     bars of light,--sad faces and glad, haggard and merry. Like all human
     kind, they flitted from the gloom into the light, and so back into
     the gloom once more. I am not subject to impressions, but the dull,
     heavy evening, with the strange business upon which we were engaged,
     combined to make me nervous and depressed. I could see from Miss
==>      Morstan's manner that she was suffering from the same feeling. Holmes <==
     alone could rise superior to petty influences. He held his open
     note-book upon his knee, and from time to time he jotted down figures
     and memoranda in the light of his pocket-lantern.

     At the Lyceum Theatre the crowds were already thick at the

[line number in individual story] matching line = 684    window = 679 689

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 5373    window = 5368 5378


     moving anecdote as to how a musket looked into my tent at the dead of
     night, and how I fired a double-barrelled tiger cub at it. At first I
     had some idea as to the direction in which we were driving; but soon,
     what with our pace, the fog, and my own limited knowledge of London,
     I lost my bearings, and knew nothing, save that we seemed to be going
==>      a very long way. Sherlock Holmes was never at fault, however, and he <==
     muttered the names as the cab rattled through squares and in and out
     by tortuous by-streets.

     "Rochester Row," said he. "Now Vincent Square. Now we come out on the
     Vauxhall Bridge Road. We are making for the Surrey side, apparently.

     "Mr. Thaddeus Sholto," said the little man, still jerking and
     smiling. "That is my name. You are Miss Morstan, of course. And these
     gentlemen--"

==>      "This is Mr. Sherlock Holmes, and this is Dr. Watson." <==

     "A doctor, eh?" cried he, much excited. "Have you your stethoscope?
     Might I ask you--would you have the kindness? I have grave doubts as
     to my mitral valve, if you would be so very good. The aortic I may
     rely upon, but I should value your opinion upon the mitral."

     satisfactorily among ourselves, without any interference. Nothing
     would annoy Brother Bartholomew more than any publicity." He sat down
     upon a low settee and blinked at us inquiringly with his weak, watery
     blue eyes.

==>      "For my part," said Holmes, "whatever you may choose to say will go <==
     no further."

     I nodded to show my agreement.

     "That is well! That is well!" said he. "May I offer you a glass of

     for a few moments. We had all sat absorbed, listening to his
     extraordinary narrative. At the short account of her father's death
     Miss Morstan had turned deadly white, and for a moment I feared that
     she was about to faint. She rallied however, on drinking a glass of
     water which I quietly poured out for her from a Venetian carafe upon
==>      the side-table. Sherlock Holmes leaned back in his chair with an <==
     abstracted expression and the lids drawn low over his glittering
     eyes. As I glanced at him I could not but think how on that very day
     he had complained bitterly of the commonplaceness of life. Here at
     least was a problem which would tax his sagacity to the utmost. Mr.
     Thaddeus Sholto looked from one to the other of us with an obvious

[line number in individual story] matching line = 1023    window = 1018 1028

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 5712    window = 5707 5717


     and demand our share. I explained my views last night to Brother
     Bartholomew: so we shall be expected, if not welcome, visitors."

     Mr. Thaddeus Sholto ceased, and sat twitching on his luxurious
     settee. We all remained silent, with our thoughts upon the new
==>      development which the mysterious business had taken. Holmes was the <==
     first to spring to his feet.

     "You have done well, sir, from first to last," said he. "It is
     possible that we may be able to make you some small return by
     throwing some light upon that which is still dark to you. But, as

     confirmed hypochondriac, and I was dreamily conscious that he was
     pouring forth interminable trains of symptoms, and imploring
     information as to the composition and action of innumerable quack
     nostrums, some of which he bore about in a leather case in his
     pocket. I trust that he may not remember any of the answers which I
==>      gave him that night. Holmes declares that he overheard me caution him <==
     against the great danger of taking more than two drops of castor oil,
     while I recommended strychnine in large doses as a sedative. However
     that may be, I was certainly relieved when our cab pulled up with a
     jerk and the coachman sprang down to open the door.

     "Very sorry, Mr. Thaddeus," said the porter, inexorably. "Folk may be
     friends o' yours, and yet no friends o' the master's. He pays me well
     to do my duty, and my duty I'll do. I don't know none o' your
     friends."

==>      "Oh, yes you do, McMurdo," cried Sherlock Holmes, genially. "I don't <==
     think you can have forgotten me. Don't you remember the amateur who
     fought three rounds with you at Alison's rooms on the night of your
     benefit four years back?"

     "Not Mr. Sherlock Holmes!" roared the prize-fighter. "God's truth!

     how could I have mistook you? If instead o' standin' there so quiet
     you had just stepped up and given me that cross-hit of yours under
     the jaw, I'd ha' known you without a question. Ah, you're one that
     has wasted your gifts, you have! You might have aimed high, if you
     had joined the fancy."

     had joined the fancy."

     "You see, Watson, if all else fails me I have still one of the
==>      scientific professions open to me," said Holmes, laughing. "Our <==
     friend won't keep us out in the cold now, I am sure."

     "In you come, sir, in you come,--you and your friends," he answered.
     "Very sorry, Mr. Thaddeus, but orders are very strict. Had to be
     certain of your friends before I let them in."

     "I cannot understand it," he said. "There must be some mistake. I
     distinctly told Bartholomew that we should be here, and yet there is
     no light in his window. I do not know what to make of it."

==>      "Does he always guard the premises in this way?" asked Holmes. <==

     "Yes; he has followed my father's custom. He was the favorite son,
     you know, and I sometimes think that my father may have told him more
     than he ever told me. That is Bartholomew's window up there where the
     moonshine strikes. It is quite bright, but there is no light from

     you know, and I sometimes think that my father may have told him more
     than he ever told me. That is Bartholomew's window up there where the
     moonshine strikes. It is quite bright, but there is no light from
     within, I think."

==>      "None," said Holmes. "But I see the glint of a light in that little <==
     window beside the door."

     "Ah, that is the housekeeper's room. That is where old Mrs. Bernstone
     sits. She can tell us all about it. But perhaps you would not mind
     waiting here for a minute or two, for if we all go in together and

     "Oh, Mr. Thaddeus, sir, I am so glad you have come! I am so glad you
     have come, Mr. Thaddeus, sir!" We heard her reiterated rejoicings
     until the door was closed and her voice died away into a muffled
     monotone.

==>      Our guide had left us the lantern. Holmes swung it slowly round, and <==
     peered keenly at the house, and at the great rubbish-heaps which
     cumbered the grounds. Miss Morstan and I stood together, and her hand
     was in mine. A wondrous subtle thing is love, for here were we two
     who had never seen each other before that day, between whom no word
     or even look of affection had ever passed, and yet now in an hour of

     "It looks as though all the moles in England had been let loose in
     it. I have seen something of the sort on the side of a hill near
     Ballarat, where the prospectors had been at work."

==>      "And from the same cause," said Holmes. "These are the traces of the <==
     treasure-seekers. You must remember that they were six years looking
     for it. No wonder that the grounds look like a gravel-pit."

     At that moment the door of the house burst open, and Thaddeus Sholto
     came running out, with his hands thrown forward and terror in his

     frightened! My nerves cannot stand it." He was, indeed, half
     blubbering with fear, and his twitching feeble face peeping out from
     the great Astrakhan collar had the helpless appealing expression of a
     terrified child.

==>      "Come into the house," said Holmes, in his crisp, firm way. <==

     "Yes, do!" pleaded Thaddeus Sholto. "I really do not feel equal to
     giving directions."

     We all followed him into the housekeeper's room, which stood upon the

     up and peeped through the key-hole. You must go up, Mr.
     Thaddeus,--you must go up and look for yourself. I have seen Mr.
     Bartholomew Sholto in joy and in sorrow for ten long years, but I
     never saw him with such a face on him as that."

==>      Sherlock Holmes took the lamp and led the way, for Thaddeus Sholto's <==
     teeth were chattering in his head. So shaken was he that I had to
     pass my hand under his arm as we went up the stairs, for his knees
     were trembling under him. Twice as we ascended Holmes whipped his
     lens out of his pocket and carefully examined marks which appeared to
     me to be mere shapeless smudges of dust upon the cocoa-nut matting

     holding the lamp, and shooting keen glances to right and left. Miss
     Morstan had remained behind with the frightened housekeeper.

     long black shadows streaming backwards down the corridor. The third
     door was that which we were seeking. Holmes knocked without receiving
     any answer, and then tried to turn the handle and force it open. It
     was locked on the inside, however, and by a broad and powerful bolt,

     "There is something devilish in this, Watson," said he, more moved
     than I had ever before seen him. "What do you make of it?"

     to the nerves than any scowl or contortion. So like was the face to
     that of our little friend that I looked round at him to make sure
     that he was indeed with us. Then I recalled to mind that he had
     mentioned to us that his brother and he were twins.

==>      "This is terrible!" I said to Holmes. "What is to be done?" <==

     "The door must come down," he answered, and, springing against it, he
     put all his weight upon the lock. It creaked and groaned, but did not
     yield. Together we flung ourselves upon it once more, and this time
     it gave way with a sudden snap, and we found ourselves within

     and had clearly been dead many hours. It seemed to me that not only
     his features but all his limbs were twisted and turned in the most
     fantastic fashion. By his hand upon the table there lay a peculiar
     instrument,--a brown, close-grained stick, with a stone head like a
     hammer, rudely lashed on with coarse twine. Beside it was a torn
==>      sheet of note-paper with some words scrawled upon it. Holmes glanced <==
     at it, and then handed it to me.

     "You see," he said, with a significant raising of the eyebrows.

     In the light of the lantern I read, with a thrill of horror, "The

     don't think that it was I? Is it likely that I would have brought you
     here if it were I? Oh, dear! oh, dear! I know that I shall go mad!"
     He jerked his arms and stamped his feet in a kind of convulsive
     frenzy.

==>      "You have no reason for fear, Mr. Sholto," said Holmes, kindly, <==
     putting his hand upon his shoulder. "Take my advice, and drive down
     to the station to report this matter to the police. Offer to assist
     them in every way. We shall wait here until your return."

     The little man obeyed in a half-stupefied fashion, and we heard him

     them in every way. We shall wait here until your return."

     The little man obeyed in a half-stupefied fashion, and we heard him
     stumbling down the stairs in the dark.

==>      "Now, Watson," said Holmes, rubbing his hands, "we have half an hour <==
     to ourselves. Let us make good use of it. My case is, as I have told
     you, almost complete; but we must not err on the side of
     over-confidence. Simple as the case seems now, there may be something
     deeper underlying it."

     "This is all very well," said I, "but the thing becomes more
     unintelligible than ever. How about this mysterious ally? How came he
     into the room?"

==>      "Yes, the ally!" repeated Holmes, pensively. "There are features of <==
     interest about this ally. He lifts the case from the regions of the
     commonplace. I fancy that this ally breaks fresh ground in the annals
     of crime in this country,--though parallel cases suggest themselves
     from India, and, if my memory serves me, from Senegambia."

     beam to beam. The roof ran up to an apex, and was evidently the inner
     shell of the true roof of the house. There was no furniture of any
     sort, and the accumulated dust of years lay thick upon the floor.

==>      "Here you are, you see," said Sherlock Holmes, putting his hand <==
     against the sloping wall. "This is a trap-door which leads out on to
     the roof. I can press it back, and here is the roof itself, sloping
     at a gentle angle. This, then, is the way by which Number One
     entered. Let us see if we can find one other traces of his
     individuality."

     For myself, as I followed his gaze my skin was cold under my clothes.
     The floor was covered thickly with the prints of a naked
     foot,--clear, well defined, perfectly formed, but scarce half the
     size of those of an ordinary man.

==>      "Holmes," I said, in a whisper, "a child has done the horrid thing." <==

     He had recovered his self-possession in an instant. "I was staggered
     for the moment," he said, "but the thing is quite natural. My memory
     failed me, or I should have been able to foretell it. There is
     nothing more to be learned here. Let us go down."

     accredited representatives of the law."

     Heavy steps and the clamor of loud voices were audible from below,
     and the hall door shut with a loud crash.

==>      "Before they come," said Holmes, "just put your hand here on this <==
     poor fellow's arm, and here on his leg. What do you feel?"

     "The muscles are as hard as a board," I answered.

     "Quite so. They are in a state of extreme contraction, far exceeding

     "Here's a business!" he cried, in a muffled, husky voice. "Here's a
     pretty business! But who are all these? Why, the house seems to be as
     full as a rabbit-warren!"

==>      "I think you must recollect me, Mr. Athelney Jones," said Holmes, <==
     quietly.

     "Why, of course I do!" he wheezed. "It's Mr. Sherlock Holmes, the
     theorist. Remember you! I'll never forget how you lectured us all on
     causes and inferences and effects in the Bishopgate jewel case. It's

     quietly.

     true you set us on the right track; but you'll own now that it was
     more by good luck than good guidance."

     this? Bad business! Bad business! Stern facts here,--no room for
     theories. How lucky that I happened to be out at Norwood over another
     case! I was at the station when the message arrived. What d'you think
     the man died of?"

==>      "Oh, this is hardly a case for me to theorize over," said Holmes, <==
     dryly.

     "No, no. Still, we can't deny that you hit the nail on the head
     sometimes. Dear me! Door locked, I understand. Jewels worth half a
     million missing. How was the window?"

     "Well, well, if it was fastened the steps could have nothing to do
     with the matter. That's common sense. Man might have died in a fit;
     but then the jewels are missing. Ha! I have a theory. These flashes
     come upon me at times.--Just step outside, sergeant, and you, Mr.
==>      Sholto. Your friend can remain.--What do you think of this, Holmes? <==
     Sholto was, on his own confession, with his brother last night. The
     brother died in a fit, on which Sholto walked off with the treasure.
     How's that?"

     His bed had not been slept in. Thaddeus is evidently in a most
     disturbed state of mind. His appearance is--well, not attractive. You
     see that I am weaving my web round Thaddeus. The net begins to close
     upon him."

==>      "You are not quite in possession of the facts yet," said Holmes. <==
     "This splinter of wood, which I have every reason to believe to be
     poisoned, was in the man's scalp where you still see the mark; this
     card, inscribed as you see it, was on the table; and beside it lay
     this rather curious stone-headed instrument. How does all that fit
     into your theory?"

     he depart? Ah, of course, here is a hole in the roof." With great
     activity, considering his bulk, he sprang up the steps and squeezed
     through into the garret, and immediately afterwards we heard his
     exulting voice proclaiming that he had found the trap-door.

==>      "He can find something," remarked Holmes, shrugging his shoulders. <==
     "He has occasional glimmerings of reason. Il n'y a pas des sots si
     incommodes que ceux qui ont de l'esprit!"

     "You see!" said Athelney Jones, reappearing down the steps again.
     "Facts are better than mere theories, after all. My view of the case

     your brother."

     "There, now! Didn't I tell you!" cried the poor little man, throwing
     out his hands, and looking from one to the other of us.

==>      "Don't trouble yourself about it, Mr. Sholto," said Holmes. "I think <==
     that I can engage to clear you of the charge."

     "Don't promise too much, Mr. Theorist,--don't promise too much!"
     snapped the detective. "You may find it a harder matter than you
     think."

     "Ah! the other man--?" asked Athelney Jones, in a sneering voice, but
     impressed none the less, as I could easily see, by the precision of
     the other's manner.

==>      "Is a rather curious person," said Sherlock Holmes, turning upon his <==
     heel. "I hope before very long to be able to introduce you to the
     pair of them. A word with you, Watson."

     He led me out to the head of the stair. "This unexpected occurrence,"

     London."

     "I shall bring him, then," said I. "It is one now. I ought to be back
     before three, if I can get a fresh horse."

==>      "And I," said Holmes, "shall see what I can learn from Mrs. <==
     Bernstone, and from the Indian servant, who, Mr. Thaddeus tell me,
     sleeps in the next garret. Then I shall study the great Jones's
     methods and listen to his not too delicate sarcasms. 'Wir sind

     conventionalities of life could not teach me to know her sweet, brave
     nature as had this one day of strange experiences. Yet there were two
     thoughts which sealed the words of affection upon my lips. She was
     weak and helpless, shaken in mind and nerve. It was to take her at a
     disadvantage to obtrude love upon her at such a time. Worse still,
==>      she was rich. If Holmes's researches were successful, she would be an <==
     heiress. Was it fair, was it honorable, that a half-pay surgeon
     should take such advantage of an intimacy which chance had brought
     about? Might she not look upon me as a mere vulgar fortune-seeker? I
     could not bear to risk that such a thought should cross her mind.

     effect, for the window instantly slammed down, and within a minute
     the door was unbarred and open. Mr. Sherman was a lanky, lean old
     man, with stooping shoulders, a stringy neck, and blue-tinted
     glasses.

     the dog on my mentioning the detective's name.

     you. Now I must kick off my boots and stockings.--Just you carry them
     down with you, Watson. I am going to do a little climbing. And dip my
     handkerchief into the creasote. That will do. Now come up into the
     garret with me for a moment."

     upon the footsteps in the dust.

     "I wish you particularly to notice these footmarks," he said. "Do you
     observe anything noteworthy about them?"

     "That is where he put his foot in getting out. If you can trace him,
     I should think that Toby will have no difficulty. Now run
     down-stairs, loose the dog, and look out for Blondin."

==>      By the time that I got out into the grounds Sherlock Holmes was on <==
     the roof, and I could see him like an enormous glow-worm crawling
     very slowly along the ridge. I lost sight of him behind a stack of
     chimneys, but he presently reappeared, and then vanished once more
     upon the opposite side. When I made my way round there I found him
     seated at one of the corner eaves.

     "Here you are, doggy! Good old Toby! Smell it, Toby, smell it!" He
     pushed the creasote handkerchief under the dog's nose, while the
     creature stood with its fluffy legs separated, and with a most
     comical cock to its head, like a connoisseur sniffing the bouquet of
==>      a famous vintage. Holmes then threw the handkerchief to a distance, <==
     fastened a stout cord to the mongrel's collar, and let him to the
     foot of the water-barrel. The creature instantly broke into a
     succession of high, tremulous yelps, and, with his nose on the
     ground, and his tail in the air, pattered off upon the trail at a
     pace which strained his leash and kept us at the top of our speed.

     On reaching the boundary wall Toby ran along, whining eagerly,
     underneath its shadow, and stopped finally in a corner screened by a
     young beech. Where the two walls joined, several bricks had been
     loosened, and the crevices left were worn down and rounded upon the
     lower side, as though they had frequently been used as a ladder.

     upon the other side.

     "There's the print of wooden-leg's hand," he remarked, as I mounted
     up beside him. "You see the slight smudge of blood upon the white

     fears were soon appeased, however. Toby never hesitated or swerved,
     but waddled on in his peculiar rolling fashion. Clearly, the pungent
     smell of the creasote rose high above all other contending scents.

     in the chemical. I have knowledge now which would enable me to trace
     them in many different ways. This, however, is the readiest and,

     be. There might have been some credit to be gained out of it, but for
     this too palpable clue."

==>      "There is credit, and to spare," said I. "I assure you, Holmes, that <==
     I marvel at the means by which you obtain your results in this case,
     even more than I did in the Jefferson Hope Murder. The thing seems to
     me to be deeper and more inexplicable. How, for example, could you
     describe with such confidence the wooden-legged man?"

     Toby ceased to advance, but began to run backwards and forwards with
     one ear cocked and the other drooping, the very picture of canine
     indecision. Then he waddled round in circles, looking up to us from
     time to time, as if to ask for sympathy in his embarrassment.

==>      "What the deuce is the matter with the dog?" growled Holmes. "They <==
     surely would not take a cab, or go off in a balloon."

     "Perhaps they stood here for some time," I suggested.

     "Ah! it's all right. He's off again," said my companion, in a tone of

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 6869    window = 6864 6874


     He was indeed off, for after sniffing round again he suddenly made up
     his mind, and darted away with an energy and determination such as he
     had not yet shown. The scent appeared to be much hotter than before,
     for he had not even to put his nose on the ground, but tugged at his
     leash and tried to break into a run. I cold see by the gleam in
==>      Holmes's eyes that he thought we were nearing the end of our journey. <==

     Our course now ran down Nine Elms until we came to Broderick and
     Nelson's large timber-yard, just past the White Eagle tavern. Here
     the dog, frantic with excitement, turned down through the side-gate
     into the enclosure, where the sawyers were already at work. On the

     Toby stood upon the cask, looking from one to the other of us for
     some sign of appreciation. The staves of the barrel and the wheels of
     the trolley were smeared with a dark liquid, and the whole air was
     heavy with the smell of creasote.

==>      Sherlock Holmes and I looked blankly at each other, and then burst <==
     simultaneously into an uncontrollable fit of laughter.

     "What now?" I asked. "Toby has lost his character for infallibility."

     "He acted according to his lights," said Holmes, lifting him down

     Sherlock Holmes and I looked blankly at each other, and then burst
     simultaneously into an uncontrollable fit of laughter.

     "What now?" I asked. "Toby has lost his character for infallibility."

==>      "He acted according to his lights," said Holmes, lifting him down <==
     from the barrel and walking him out of the timber-yard. "If you
     consider how much creasote is carted about London in one day, it is
     no great wonder that our trail should have been crossed. It is much
     used now, especially for the seasoning of wood. Poor Toby is not to
     blame."

     and Prince's Street. At the end of Broad Street it ran right down to
     the water's edge, where there was a small wooden wharf. Toby led us
     to the very edge of this, and there stood whining, looking out on the
     dark current beyond.

==>      "We are out of luck," said Holmes. "They have taken to a boat here." <==
     Several small punts and skiffs were lying about in the water and on
     the edge of the wharf. We took Toby round to each in turn, but,
     though he sniffed earnestly, he made no sign.

     Close to the rude landing-stage was a small brick house, with a

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 6930    window = 6925 6935


     Close to the rude landing-stage was a small brick house, with a
     wooden placard slung out through the second window. "Mordecai Smith"
     was printed across it in large letters, and, underneath, "Boats to
     hire by the hour or day." A second inscription above the door
     informed us that a steam launch was kept,--a statement which was
==>      confirmed by a great pile of coke upon the jetty. Sherlock Holmes <==
     looked slowly round, and his face assumed an ominous expression.

     "This looks bad," said he. "These fellows are sharper than I
     expected. They seem to have covered their tracks. There has, I fear,
     been preconcerted management here."

     "You come back and be washed, Jack," she shouted. "Come back, you
     young imp; for if your father comes home and finds you like that,
     he'll let us hear of it."

==>      "Dear little chap!" said Holmes, strategically. "What a rosy-cheeked <==
     young rascal! Now, Jack, is there anything you would like?"

     The youth pondered for a moment. "I'd like a shillin'," said he.

     "Nothing you would like better?"

     much for me to manage, 'specially when my man is away days at a
     time."

==>      "Away, is he?" said Holmes, in a disappointed voice. "I am sorry for <==
     that, for I wanted to speak to Mr. Smith."

     "He's been away since yesterday mornin', sir, and, truth to tell, I
     am beginnin' to feel frightened about him. But if it was about a
     boat, sir, maybe I could serve as well."

     don't like that wooden-legged man, wi' his ugly face and outlandish
     talk. What did he want always knockin' about here for?"

==>      "A wooden-legged man?" said Holmes, with bland surprise. <==

     "Yes, sir, a brown, monkey-faced chap that's called more'n once for
     my old man. It was him that roused him up yesternight, and, what's
     more, my man knew he was comin', for he had steam up in the launch. I
     tell you straight, sir, I don't feel easy in my mind about it."

     are frightening yourself about nothing. How could you possibly tell
     that it was the wooden-legged man who came in the night? I don't
     quite understand how you can be so sure."

     Smith.--There is a boatman here with a wherry, Watson. We shall take
     it and cross the river.

==>      "The main thing with people of that sort," said Holmes, as we sat in <==
     the sheets of the wherry, "is never to let them think that their
     information can be of the slightest importance to you. If you do,
     they will instantly shut up like an oyster. If you listen to them

     of use to us yet."

     despatched his wire. "Whom do you think that is to?" he asked, as we

     however, was a different matter. That, or part of it, belonged
     rightfully to Miss Morstan. While there was a chance of recovering it
     I was ready to devote my life to the one object. True, if I found it
     it would probably put her forever beyond my reach. Yet it would be a
     petty and selfish love which would be influenced by such a thought as

     stronger reason to urge me on to find the treasure.

     A bath at Baker Street and a complete change freshened me up
     wonderfully. When I came down to our room I found the breakfast laid

     Bartholomew Sholto, of Pondicherry Lodge, Upper Norwood, was found
     dead in his room under circumstances which point to foul play. As far
     as we can learn, no actual traces of violence were found upon Mr.
     Sholto's person, but a valuable collection of Indian gems which the
     deceased gentleman had inherited from his father has been carried
==>      off. The discovery was first made by Mr. Sherlock Holmes and Dr. <==
     Watson, who had called at the house with Mr. Thaddeus Sholto, brother
     of the deceased. By a singular piece of good fortune, Mr. Athelney
     Jones, the well-known member of the detective police force, happened
     to be at the Norwood Police Station, and was on the ground within
     half an hour of the first alarm. His trained and experienced

     think that it supplies an argument to those who would wish to see our
     detectives more decentralized, and so brought into closer and more
     effective touch with the cases which it is their duty to
     investigate."

==>      "Isn't it gorgeous!" said Holmes, grinning over his coffee-cup. "What <==
     do you think of it?"

     "I think that we have had a close shave ourselves of being arrested
     for the crime."

     At this moment there was a loud ring at the bell, and I could hear
     Mrs. Hudson, our landlady, raising her voice in a wail of
     expostulation and dismay.

==>      "By heaven, Holmes," I said, half rising, "I believe that they are <==
     really after us."

     "No, it's not quite so bad as that. It is the unofficial force,--the
     Baker Street irregulars."

     "Got your message, sir," said he, "and brought 'em on sharp. Three
     bob and a tanner for tickets."

     can report to you, Wiggins, and you to me. I cannot have the house
     invaded in this way. However, it is just as well that you should all
     hear the instructions. I want to find the whereabouts of a steam

     "The old scale of pay, and a guinea to the boy who finds the boat.
     Here's a day in advance. Now off you go!" He handed them a shilling
     each, and away they buzzed down the stairs, and I saw them a moment
     later streaming down the street.

==>      "If the launch is above water they will find her," said Holmes, as he <==
     rose from the table and lit his pipe. "They can go everywhere, see
     everything, overhear every one. I expect to hear before evening that
     they have spotted her. In the mean while, we can do nothing but await
     results. We cannot pick up the broken trail until we find either the
     Aurora or Mr. Mordecai Smith."

     fall of his bow. Then I seemed to be floated peacefully away upon a
     soft sea of sound, until I found myself in dream-land, with the sweet
     face of Mary Morstan looking down upon me.

     It was late in the afternoon before I woke, strengthened and
==>      refreshed. Sherlock Holmes still sat exactly as I had left him, save <==
     that he had laid aside his violin and was deep in a book. He looked
     across at me, as I stirred, and I noticed that his face was dark and
     troubled.

     "Then I shall run over to Camberwell and call upon Mrs. Cecil
     Forrester. She asked me to, yesterday."

==>      "On Mrs. Cecil Forrester?" asked Holmes, with the twinkle of a smile <==
     in his eyes.

     happened."

     in his eyes.

     "Well, of course Miss Morstan too. They were anxious to hear what
     happened."

==>      "I would not tell them too much," said Holmes. "Women are never to be <==
     entirely trusted,--not the best of them."

     I did not pause to argue over this atrocious sentiment. "I shall be
     back in an hour or two," I remarked.

     It was evening before I left Camberwell, and quite dark by the time I
     reached home. My companion's book and pipe lay by his chair, but he
     had disappeared. I looked about in the hope of seeing a note, but
     there was none.

==>      "I suppose that Mr. Sherlock Holmes has gone out," I said to Mrs.  <==
     Hudson as she came up to lower the blinds.

     "No, sir. He has gone to his room, sir. Do you know, sir," sinking
     her voice into an impressive whisper, "I am afraid for his health?"

     from the other agencies. There were articles in most of the papers
     upon the Norwood tragedy. They all appeared to be rather hostile to
     the unfortunate Thaddeus Sholto. No fresh details were to be found,
     however, in any of them, save that an inquest was to be held upon the
     following day. I walked over to Camberwell in the evening to report
==>      our ill success to the ladies, and on my return I found Holmes <==
     dejected and somewhat morose. He would hardly reply to my questions,
     and busied himself all evening in an abstruse chemical analysis which
     involved much heating of retorts and distilling of vapors, ending at
     last in a smell which fairly drove me out of the apartment. Up to the
     small hours of the morning I could hear the clinking of his

     returning or an answer to his advertisement. I tried to read, but my
     thoughts would wander off to our strange quest and to the
     ill-assorted and villainous pair whom we were pursuing. Could there
     be, I wondered, some radical flaw in my companion's reasoning. Might
     he be suffering from some huge self-deception? Was it not possible

     plainer and more commonplace one lay ready to his hand. Yet, on the
     other hand, I had myself seen the evidence, and I had heard the
     reasons for his deductions. When I looked back on the long chain of
     curious circumstances, many of them trivial in themselves, but all
     tending in the same direction, I could not disguise from myself that

     At three o'clock in the afternoon there was a loud peal at the bell,

     person than Mr. Athelney Jones was shown up to me. Very different was

     person than Mr. Athelney Jones was shown up to me. Very different was
     he, however, from the brusque and masterful professor of common sense
     who had taken over the case so confidently at Upper Norwood. His
     expression was downcast, and his bearing meek and even apologetic.

     understand."

     "Yes, and I cannot be sure when he will be back. But perhaps you
     would care to wait. Take that chair and try one of these cigars."

     in a husky and confidential voice. "He's a man who is not to be beat.

     "What is it, my man?" I asked.

     He looked about him in the slow methodical fashion of old age.

     "No; but I am acting for him. You can tell me any message you have
     for him."

     "It was to him himself I was to tell it," said he.

     "No, no; I ain't goin' to lose a whole day to please no one. If Mr.

     He came across sullenly enough, and seated himself with his face
     resting on his hands. Jones and I resumed our cigars and our talk.

     "I think that you might offer me a cigar too," he said.

     resting on his hands. Jones and I resumed our cigars and our talk.
     Suddenly, however, Holmes's voice broke in upon us.

     "I think that you might offer me a cigar too," he said.

==>      We both started in our chairs. There was Holmes sitting close to us <==
     with an air of quiet amusement.

     "Holmes!" I exclaimed. "You here! But where is the old man?"

     "Here is the old man," said he, holding out a heap of white hair.

==>      "Holmes!" I exclaimed. "You here! But where is the old man?" <==

     "Here is the old man," said he, holding out a heap of white hair.
     "Here he is,--wig, whiskers, eyebrows, and all. I thought my disguise
     was pretty good, but I hardly expected that it would stand that
     test."

     "Only that I insist upon your dining with us. It will be ready in
     half an hour. I have oysters and a brace of grouse, with something a
     little choice in white wines.--Watson, you have never yet recognized
     my merits as a housekeeper."

==>      Our meal was a merry one. Holmes coud talk exceedingly well when he <==
     chose, and that night he did choose. He appeared to be in a state of
     nervous exaltation. I have never known him so brilliant. He spoke on
     a quick succession of subjects,--on miracle-plays, on medieval
     pottery, on Stradivarius violins, on the Buddhism of Ceylon, and on
     the war-ships of the future,--handling each as though he had made a

     special study of it. His bright humor marked the reaction from his
     black depression of the preceding days. Athelney Jones proved to be a
     sociable soul in his hours of relaxation, and face his dinner with
     the air of a bon vivant. For myself, I felt elated at the thought
     that we were nearing the end of our task, and I caught something of
==>      Holmes's gaiety. None of us alluded during dinner to the cause which <==
     had brought us together.

     When the cloth was cleared, Holmes glanced at this watch, and filled
     up three glasses with port. "One bumper," said he, "to the success of
     our little expedition. And now it is high time we were off. Have you

     "I have my old service-revolver in my desk."

     "You had best take it, then. It is well to be prepared. I see that
     the cab is at the door. I ordered it for half-past six."

     It was a little past seven before we reached the Westminster wharf,
==>      and found our launch awaiting us. Holmes eyed it critically. <==

     "Is there anything to mark it as a police-boat?"

     "Yes,--that green lamp at the side."

     "Yes,--that green lamp at the side."

     "Then take it off."

     The small change was made, we stepped on board, and the ropes were
==>      cast off. Jones, Holmes, and I sat in the stern. There was one man at <==
     the rudder, one to tend the engines, and two burly police-inspectors
     forward.

     "Where to?" asked Jones.


[line number in individual story] matching line = 3063    window = 3058 3068

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 7752    window = 7747 7757


     "Where to?" asked Jones.

     "To the Tower. Tell them to stop opposite Jacobson's Yard."

     Our craft was evidently a very fast one. We shot past the long lines
==>      of loaded barges as though they were stationary. Holmes smiled with <==
     satisfaction as we overhauled a river steamer and left her behind us.

     "We ought to be able to catch anything on the river," he said.

     "Well, hardly that. But there are not many launches to beat us."

     While this conversation had been proceeding, we had been shooting the
     long series of bridges which span the Thames. As we passed the City
     the last rays of the sun were gilding the cross upon the summit of
     St. Paul's. It was twilight before we reached the Tower.

==>      "That is Jacobson's Yard," said Holmes, pointing to a bristle of <==
     masts and rigging on the Surrey side. "Cruise gently up and down here
     under cover of this string of lighters." He took a pair of
     night-glasses from his pocket and gazed some time at the shore. "I
     see my sentry at his post," he remarked, "but no sign of a
     handkerchief."

     "Suppose we go down-stream a short way and lie in wait for them,"
     said Jones, eagerly. We were all eager by this time, even the
     policemen and stokers, who had a very vague idea of what was going
     forward.

==>      "We have no right to take anything for granted," Holmes answered. "It <==
     is certainly ten to one that they go down-stream, but we cannot be
     certain. From this point we can see the entrance of the yard, and
     they can hardly see us. It will be a clear night and plenty of light.
     We must stay where we are. See how the folk swarm over yonder in the
     gaslight."

     at them. There is no a priori probability about it. A strange enigma
     is man!"

     "Some one calls him a soul concealed in an animal," I suggested.

==>      "Winwood Reade is good upon the subject," said Holmes. "He remarks <==
     that, while the individual man is an insoluble puzzle, in the
     aggregate he becomes a mathematical certainty. You can, for example,
     never foretell what any one man will do, but you can say with
     precision what an average number will be up to. Individuals vary, but
     percentages remain constant. So says the statistician. But do I see a

     percentages remain constant. So says the statistician. But do I see a
     handkerchief? Surely there is a white flutter over yonder."

     "Yes, it is your boy," I cried. "I can see him plainly."

==>      "And there is the Aurora," exclaimed Holmes, "and going like the <==
     devil! Full speed ahead, engineer. Make after that launch with the
     yellow light. By heaven, I shall never forgive myself if she proves
     to have the heels of us!"

     She had slipped unseen through the yard-entrance and passed behind

     shore, going at a tremendous rate. Jones looked gravely at her and
     shook his head.

     "She is very fast," he said. "I doubt if we shall catch her."

==>      "We must catch her!" cried Holmes, between his teeth. "Heap it on, <==
     stokers! Make her do all she can! If we burn the boat we must have
     them!"

     We were fairly after her now. The furnaces roared, and the powerful
     engines whizzed and clanked, like a great metallic heart. Her sharp,

[line number in individual story] matching line = 3247    window = 3242 3252

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 7936    window = 7931 7941


     going. We flashed past barges, steamers, merchant-vessels, in and
     out, behind this one and round the other. Voices hailed us out of the
     darkness, but still the Aurora thundered on, and still we followed
     close upon her track.

==>      "Pile it on, men, pile it on!" cried Holmes, looking down into the <==
     engine-room, while the fierce glow from below beat upon his eager,
     aquiline face. "Get every pound of steam you can."

     "I think we gain a little," said Jones, with his eyes on the Aurora.

     could see that from the thigh downwards there was but a wooden stump
     upon the right side. At the sound of his strident, angry cries there
     was movement in the huddled bundle upon the deck. It straightened
     itself into a little black man--the smallest I have ever seen--with a
     great, misshapen head and a shock of tangled, dishevelled hair.
==>      Holmes had already drawn his revolver, and I whipped out mine at the <==
     sight of this savage, distorted creature. He was wrapped in some sort
     of dark ulster or blanket, which left only his face exposed; but that
     face was enough to give a man a sleepless night. Never have I seen
     features so deeply marked with all bestiality and cruelty. His small
     eyes glowed and burned with a sombre light, and his thick lips were

     features so deeply marked with all bestiality and cruelty. His small
     eyes glowed and burned with a sombre light, and his thick lips were
     writhed back from his teeth, which grinned and chattered at us with a
     half animal fury.

==>      "Fire if he raises his hand," said Holmes, quietly. We were within a <==
     boat's-length by this time, and almost within touch of our quarry. I
     can see the two of them now as they stood, the white man with his
     legs far apart, shrieking out curses, and the unhallowed dwarf with
     his hideous face, and his strong yellow teeth gnashing at us in the
     light of our lantern.

     our own little cabin. As we steamed slowly up-stream again, we
     flashed our search-light in every direction, but there was no sign of
     the Islander. Somewhere in the dark ooze at the bottom of the Thames
     lie the bones of that strange visitor to our shores.

==>      "See here," said Holmes, pointing to the wooden hatchway. "We were <==
     hardly quick enough with our pistols." There, sure enough, just
     behind where we had been standing, stuck one of those murderous darts
     which we knew so well. It must have whizzed between us at the instant
     that we fired. Holmes smiled at it and shrugged his shoulders in his
     easy fashion, but I confess that it turned me sick to think of the

[line number in individual story] matching line = 3352    window = 3347 3357

     easy fashion, but I confess that it turned me sick to think of the
     horrible death which had passed so close to us that night.

     Our captive sat in the cabin opposite to the iron box which he had
     done so much and waited so long to gain. He was a sunburned,

[line number in individual story] matching line = 3372    window = 3367 3377

     his keen, twinkling eyes at the box which had been the cause of his
     ill-doings. It seemed to me that there was more sorrow than anger in
     his rigid and contained countenance. Once he looked up at me with a
     gleam of something like humour in his eyes.

==>      "Well, Jonathan Small," said Holmes, lighting a cigar, "I am sorry <==
     that it has come to this."

     "And so am I, sir," he answered, frankly. "I don't believe that I can
     swing over the job. I give you my word on the book that I never
     raised hand against Mr. Sholto. It was that little hell-hound Tonga

[line number in individual story] matching line = 3383    window = 3378 3388

     who shot one of his cursed darts into him. I had no part in it, sir.
     I was as grieved as if it had been my blood-relation. I welted the
     little devil with the slack end of the rope for it, but it was done,
     and I could not undo it again."

==>      "Have a cigar," said Holmes; "and you had best take a pull out of my <==
     flask, for you are very wet. How could you expect so small and weak a
     man as this black fellow to overpower Mr. Sholto and hold him while
     you were climbing the rope?"

     "You seem to know as much about it as if you were there, sir. The

     to Major Sholto it brought fear and guilt, to me it has meant slavery
     for life."

     At this moment Athelney Jones thrust his broad face and heavy
     shoulders into the tiny cabin. "Quite a family party," he remarked.
==>      "I think I shall have a pull at that flask, Holmes.  Well, I think we <==
     may all congratulate each other. Pity we didn't take the other alive;
     but there was no choice. I say, Holmes, you must confess that you cut
     it rather fine. It was all we could do to overhaul her."

     "All is well that ends well," said Holmes. "But I certainly did not

     "Well, if he has done no wrong we shall see that no wrong comes to
     him. If we are pretty quick in catching our men, we are not so quick
     in condemning them." It was amusing to notice how the consequential
     Jones was already beginning to give himself airs on the strength of
     the capture. From the slight smile which played over Sherlock
==>      Holmes's face, I could see that the speech had not been lost upon <==
     him.

     "We will be at Vauxhall Bridge presently," said Jones, "and shall
     land you, Dr. Watson, with the treasure-box. I need hardly tell you
     that I am taking a very grave responsibility upon myself in doing

     she detected a hollow ring in my congratulations, for I saw her
     eyebrows rise a little, and she glanced at me curiously.

     "If I have it," said she, "I owe it to you."

==>      "No, no," I answered, "not to me, but to my friend Sherlock Holmes. <==
     With all the will in the world, I could never have followed up a clue
     which has taxed even his analytical genius.  As it was, we very
     nearly lost it at the last moment."

     "Pray sit down and tell me all about it, Dr. Watson," said she.

[line number in individual story] matching line = 3520    window = 3515 3525

     nearly lost it at the last moment."

     "Pray sit down and tell me all about it, Dr. Watson," said she.

     I narrated briefly what had occurred since I had seen her
==>      last,--Holmes's new method of search, the discovery of the Aurora, <==
     the appearance of Athelney Jones, our expedition in the evening, and
     the wild chase down the Thames. She listened with parted lips and
     shining eyes to my recital of our adventures. When I spoke of the
     dart which had so narrowly missed us, she turned so white that I
     feared that she was about to faint.

     The inspector shook his head despondently, however. "It's a bad job,"
     he repeated; "and so Mr. Athelney Jones will think."

     His forecast proved to be correct, for the detective looked blank
     enough when I got to Baker Street and showed him the empty box. They
==>      had only just arrived, Holmes, the prisoner, and he, for they had <==
     changed their plans so far as to report themselves at a station upon
     the way. My companion lounged in his arm-chair with his usual
     listless expression, while Small sat stolidly opposite to him with
     his wooden leg cocked over his sound one. As I exhibited the empty
     box he leaned back in his chair and laughed aloud.

     hands. I could understand, as I saw the fury and the passion of the
     man, that it was no groundless or unnatural terror which had
     possessed Major Sholto when he first learned that the injured convict
     was upon his track.

==>      "You forget that we know nothing of all this," said Holmes quietly. <==
     "We have not heard your story, and we cannot tell how far justice may
     originally have been on your side."

     "Well, sir, you have been very fair-spoken to me, though I can see
     that I have you to thank that I have these bracelets upon my wrists.

     with the fall. You see, gentlemen, that I am keeping my promise. I am
     telling you every work of the business just exactly as it happened,
     whether it is in my favor or not."

     He stopped, and held out his manacled hands for the whiskey-and-water
==>      which Holmes had brewed for him. For myself, I confess that I had now <==
     conceived the utmost horror of the man, not only for this
     cold-blooded business in which he had been concerned, but even more
     for the somewhat flippant and careless way in which he narrated it.
     Whatever punishment was in store for him, I felt that he might expect
     no sympathy from me. Sherlock Holmes and Jones sat with their hands

     upon their knees, deeply interested in the story, but with the same
     disgust written upon their faces.  He may have observed it, for there
     was a touch of defiance in his voice and manner as he proceeded.

     "It was all very bad, no doubt," said he. "I should like to know how

     Besides, it was my life or his when once he was in the fort. If he
     had got out, the whole business would come to light, and I should
     have been court-martialled and shot as likely as not; for people were
     not very lenient at a time like that."

==>      "Go on with your story," said Holmes, shortly. <==

     "Well, we carried him in, Abdullah, Akbar, and I. A fine weight he
     was, too, for all that he was so short. Mahomet Singh was left to
     guard the door. We took him to a place which the Sikhs had already
     prepared. It was some distance off, where a winding passage leads to

     good turn,--but it is because I believe the best defence I can make
     is just to hold back nothing, but let all the world know how badly I
     have myself been served by Major Sholto, and how innocent I am of the
     death of his son."

==>      "A very remarkable account," said Sherlock Holmes. "A fitting wind-up <==
     to an extremely interesting case. There is nothing at all new to me
     in the latter part of your narrative, except that you brought your
     own rope. That I did not know. By the way, I had hoped that Tonga had
     lost all his darts; yet he managed to shoot one at us in the boat."

     "He had lost them all, sir, except the one which was in his blow-pipe
     at the time."

     "Is there any other point which you would like to ask about?" asked
     the convict, affably.

     "Is there any other point which you would like to ask about?" asked
     the convict, affably.

     "I think not, thank you," my companion answered.

     and we all know that you are a connoisseur of crime, but duty is
     duty, and I have gone rather far in doing what you and your friend
     asked me. I shall feel more at ease when we have our story-teller

     inspectors down-stairs. I am much obliged to you both for your

     "The division seems rather unfair," I remarked. "You have done all
     the work in this business. I get a wife out of it, Jones gets the
     credit, pray what remains for you?"

     "No, indeed," I answered, brusquely. "My constitution has not got
     over the Afghan campaign yet. I cannot afford to throw any extra
     strain upon it."

==>      He smiled at my vehemence. "Perhaps you are right, Watson," he said. <==
     "I suppose that its influence is physically a bad one. I find it,
     however, so transcendently stimulating and clarifying to the mind
     that its secondary action is a matter of small moment."

     "But consider!" I said, earnestly. "Count the cost! Your brain may,

     little mystery.  What do you intend to do, Miss Morstan?"

     "That is exactly what I want to ask you."

     "Mr. Thaddeus Sholto," said the little man, still jerking and
     smiling. "That is my name. You are Miss Morstan, of course. And these
     gentlemen--"

==>      "This is Mr. Sherlock Holmes, and this is Dr. Watson." <==

     "A doctor, eh?" cried he, much excited. "Have you your stethoscope?
     Might I ask you--would you have the kindness? I have grave doubts as
     to my mitral valve, if you would be so very good. The aortic I may
     rely upon, but I should value your opinion upon the mitral."

     has wasted your gifts, you have! You might have aimed high, if you
     had joined the fancy."

     scientific professions open to me," said Holmes, laughing. "Our
     friend won't keep us out in the cold now, I am sure."

     "In you come, sir, in you come,--you and your friends," he answered.

     as we could see when we set our lamp up against it. The key being
     turned, however, the hole was not entirely closed. Sherlock Holmes
     bent down to it, and instantly rose again with a sharp intaking of
     the breath.

==>      "There is something devilish in this, Watson," said he, more moved <==
     than I had ever before seen him. "What do you make of it?"

     I stooped to the hole, and recoiled in horror. Moonlight was
     streaming into the room, and it was bright with a vague and shifty
     radiance. Looking straight at me, and suspended, as it were, in the

     them in every way. We shall wait here until your return."

     The little man obeyed in a half-stupefied fashion, and we heard him
     stumbling down the stairs in the dark.

==>      "Now, Watson," said Holmes, rubbing his hands, "we have half an hour <==
     to ourselves. Let us make good use of it. My case is, as I have told
     you, almost complete; but we must not err on the side of
     over-confidence. Simple as the case seems now, there may be something
     deeper underlying it."

     mounted by the window. It rained a little last night. Here is the
     print of a foot in mould upon the sill. And here is a circular muddy
     mark, and here again upon the floor, and here again by the table. See
==>      here, Watson! This is really a very pretty demonstration." <==

     I looked at the round, well-defined muddy discs. "This is not a
     footmark," said I.

     "It is something much more valuable to us. It is the impression of a

     nothing more to be learned here. Let us go down."

     "What is your theory, then, as to those footmarks?" I asked, eagerly,
     when we had regained the lower room once more.

==>      "My dear Watson, try a little analysis yourself," said he, with a <==
     touch of impatience. "You know my methods. Apply them, and it will be
     instructive to compare results."

     "I cannot conceive anything which will cover the facts," I answered.

     impressed none the less, as I could easily see, by the precision of
     the other's manner.

     "Is a rather curious person," said Sherlock Holmes, turning upon his
     heel. "I hope before very long to be able to introduce you to the
==>      pair of them. A word with you, Watson." <==

     He led me out to the head of the stair. "This unexpected occurrence,"
     he said, "has caused us rather to lose sight of the original purpose
     of our journey."

     bit of card round my neck, so as to hang it in front of me. Thank
     you. Now I must kick off my boots and stockings.--Just you carry them

     handkerchief into the creasote. That will do. Now come up into the
     garret with me for a moment."

     We clambered up through the hole. Holmes turned his light once more
     upon the footsteps in the dust.

     very slowly along the ridge. I lost sight of him behind a stack of
     chimneys, but he presently reappeared, and then vanished once more
     upon the opposite side. When I made my way round there I found him
     seated at one of the corner eaves.

     "Yes."

     "This is the place. What is that black thing down there?"

     "They are hellish things," said he. "Look out that you don't prick
     yourself. I'm delighted to have them, for the chances are that they
     are all he has. There is the less fear of you or me finding one in
     our skin before long. I would sooner face a Martini bullet, myself.

     "Certainly," I answered.

     it and cross the river.

     "The main thing with people of that sort," said Holmes, as we sat in
     the sheets of the wherry, "is never to let them think that their
     information can be of the slightest importance to you. If you do,

     dead in his room under circumstances which point to foul play. As far
     as we can learn, no actual traces of violence were found upon Mr.
     Sholto's person, but a valuable collection of Indian gems which the
     deceased gentleman had inherited from his father has been carried
     off. The discovery was first made by Mr. Sherlock Holmes and Dr.

     of the deceased. By a singular piece of good fortune, Mr. Athelney
     Jones, the well-known member of the detective police force, happened
     to be at the Norwood Police Station, and was on the ground within
     half an hour of the first alarm. His trained and experienced
     faculties were at once directed towards the detection of the

     small. So intractable and fierce are they that all the efforts of the

     been left to his own unaided devices this affair might have taken an
     even more ghastly turn. I fancy that, even as it is, Jonathan Small
     would give a good deal not to have employed him."

     "But how came he to have so singular a companion?"

     "But how came he to have so singular a companion?"

     "Ah, that is more than I can tell. Since, however, we had already
     determined that Small had come from the Andamans, it is not so very
     wonderful that this islander should be with him. No doubt we shall
==>      know all about it in time. Look here, Watson; you look regularly <==
     done. Lie down there on the sofa, and see if I can put you to sleep."

     He took up his violin from the corner, and as I stretched myself out
     he began to play some low, dreamy, melodious air,--his own, no doubt,
     for he had a remarkable gift for improvisation. I have a vague

     In the early dawn I woke with a start, and was surprised to find him
     standing by my bedside, clad in a rude sailor dress with a
     pea-jacket, and a coarse red scarf round his neck.

==>      "I am off down the river, Watson," said he. "I have been turning it <==
     over in my mind, and I can see only one way out of it. It is worth
     trying, at all events."

     "Surely I can come with you, then?" said I.

     "There will be two or three in the boat. What else?"

     "When we secure the men we shall get the treasure. I think that it
     would be a pleasure to my friend here to take the box round to the
     young lady to whom half of it rightfully belongs. Let her be the
==>      first to open it.--Eh, Watson?" <==

     "It would be a great pleasure to me."

     "Rather an irregular proceeding," said Jones, shaking his head.
     "However, the whole thing is irregular, and I suppose we must wink at

     "Perfectly. Is there anything else?"

     "Only that I insist upon your dining with us. It will be ready in
     half an hour. I have oysters and a brace of grouse, with something a
==>      little choice in white wines.--Watson, you have never yet recognized <==
     my merits as a housekeeper."

     Our meal was a merry one. Holmes coud talk exceedingly well when he
     chose, and that night he did choose. He appeared to be in a state of
     nervous exaltation. I have never known him so brilliant. He spoke on

     had brought us together.

     When the cloth was cleared, Holmes glanced at this watch, and filled
     up three glasses with port. "One bumper," said he, "to the success of
     our little expedition. And now it is high time we were off. Have you
==>      a pistol, Watson?" <==

     "I have my old service-revolver in my desk."

     "You had best take it, then. It is well to be prepared. I see that
     the cab is at the door. I ordered it for half-past six."

     "We ought to be able to catch anything on the river," he said.

     "We shall have to catch the Aurora, and she has a name for being a

     the capture. From the slight smile which played over Sherlock
     Holmes's face, I could see that the speech had not been lost upon
     him.

     "We will be at Vauxhall Bridge presently," said Jones, "and shall
==>      land you, Dr. Watson, with the treasure-box. I need hardly tell you <==
     that I am taking a very grave responsibility upon myself in doing
     this. It is most irregular; but of course an agreement is an
     agreement. I must, however, as a matter of duty, send an inspector
     with you, since you have so valuable a charge. You will drive, no
     doubt?"

     "No, no," I answered, "not to me, but to my friend Sherlock Holmes.
     With all the will in the world, I could never have followed up a clue
     which has taxed even his analytical genius.  As it was, we very
     nearly lost it at the last moment."

     I narrated briefly what had occurred since I had seen her
     last,--Holmes's new method of search, the discovery of the Aurora,
     the appearance of Athelney Jones, our expedition in the evening, and
     the wild chase down the Thames. She listened with parted lips and
