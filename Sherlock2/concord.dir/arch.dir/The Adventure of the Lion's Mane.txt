     out before breakfast to enjoy the exquisite air. I walked along the
     cliff path which led to the steep descent to the beach. As I walked I
     heard a shout behind me, and there was Harold Stackhurst waving his
     hand in cheery greeting.

==>      "What a morning, Mr. Holmes! I thought I should see you out." <==

     "Going for a swim, I see."

     "At your old tricks again," he laughed, patting his bulging pocket.
     "Yes. McPherson started early, and I expect I may find him there."

     village constable, a big, ginger-moustached man of the slow, solid
     Sussex breed--a breed which covers much good sense under a heavy,
     silent exterior. He listened to everything, took note of all we said,
     and finally drew me aside.

==>      "I'd be glad of your advice, Mr. Holmes. This is a big thing for me <==
     to handle, and I'll hear of it from Lewes if I go wrong."

     I advised him to send for his immediate superior, and for a doctor;
     also to allow nothing to be moved, and as few fresh footmarks as
     possible to be made, until they came. In the meantime I searched the

     "Well, then, we must explore the matter of the girl. Do you know
     her?"

     "Everyone knows her. She is the beauty of the neighbourhood--a real
==>      beauty, Holmes, who would draw attention everywhere. I knew that <==
     McPherson was attracted by her, but I had no notion that it had gone
     so far as these letters would seem to indicate."

     "But who is she?"

     concentration which showed me that she possessed strong character as
     well as great beauty. Maud Bellamy will always remain in my memory as
     a most complete and remarkable woman. It seems that she already knew
     me by sight, for she turned to me at the end.

==>      "Bring them to justice, Mr. Holmes. You have my sympathy and my help, <==
     whoever they may be." It seemed to me that she glanced defiantly at
     her father and brother as she spoke.

     "Thank you," said I. "I value a woman's instinct in such matters. You
     use the word 'they.' You think that more than one was concerned?"

     "I have seen them. So has the doctor."

     "But I have examined them very carefully with a lens. They have
     peculiarities."

==>      "What are they, Mr. Holmes?" <==

     I stepped to my bureau and brought out an enlarged photograph. "This
     is my method in such cases," I explained.

     "You certainly do things thoroughly, Mr. Holmes."

     is my method in such cases," I explained.

     "I should hardly be what I am if I did not. Now let us consider this
     weal which extends round the right shoulder. Do you observe nothing
     remarkable?"

     marked points would represent where the meshes crossed each other."

     "A most ingenious comparison. Or shall we say a very stiff
     cat-o'-nine-tails with small hard knots upon it?"

==>      "By Jove, Mr. Holmes, I think you have hit it." <==

     "Or there may be some very different cause, Mr. Bardle. But your case
     is far too weak for an arrest. Besides, we have those last words--the
     'Lion's Mane.'"

     "Yes, I have considered that. If the second word had borne any
     resemblance to Murdoch--but it did not. He gave it almost in a
     shriek. I am sure that it was 'Mane.'"

==>      "Have you no alternative, Mr. Holmes?" <==

     "Perhaps I have. But I do not care to discuss it until there is
     something more solid to discuss."

     "And when will that be?"

     "In an hour--possibly less."

     The inspector rubbed his chin and looked at me with dubious eyes.

==>      "I wish I could see what was in your mind, Mr. Holmes. Perhaps it's <==
     those fishing-boats."

     "No, no, they were too far out."

     "Well, then, is it Bellamy and that big son of his? They were not too

     faint, but at least it was ease from pain.

     To question him had been impossible, but the moment we were assured
     of his condition Stackhurst turned upon me.

==>      "My God!" he cried, "what is it, Holmes? What is it?" <==

     "Where did you find him?"

     "Down on the beach. Exactly where poor McPherson met his end. If this
     man's heart had been weak as McPherson's was, he would not be here

     "Did you see him on the beach?"

     "I was walking on the cliff when I heard his cry. He was at the edge
     of the water, reeling about like a drunken man. I ran down, threw
     some clothes about him, and brought him up. For heaven's sake,
==>      Holmes, use all the powers you have and spare no pains to lift the <==
     curse from this place, for life is becoming unendurable. Can you,
     with all your world-wide reputation, do nothing for us?"

     "I think I can, Stackhurst. Come with me now! And you, Inspector,
     come along! We will see if we cannot deliver this murderer into your

     cleared we saw that it had settled upon the ledge below. One flapping
     edge of yellow membrane showed that our victim was beneath it. A
     thick oily scum oozed out from below the stone and stained the water
     round, rising slowly to the surface.

==>      "Well, this gets me!" cried the inspector. "What was it, Mr. Holmes? <==
     I'm born and bred in these parts, but I never saw such a thing. It
     don't belong to Sussex."

     "Just as well for Sussex," I remarked. "It may have been the
     southwest gale that brought it up. Come back to my house, both of

     bottleful, and it seems to have saved his life. There is the book,
     Inspector. I leave it with you, and you cannot doubt that it contains
     a full explanation of the tragedy of poor McPherson."

     "And incidentally exonerates me," remarked Ian Murdoch with a wry
==>      smile. "I do not blame you, Inspector, nor you, Mr. Holmes, for your <==
     suspicions were natural. I feel that on the very eve of my arrest I
     have only cleared myself by sharing the fate of my poor friend."

     "No, Mr. Murdoch. I was already upon the track, and had I been out as
     early as I intended I might well have saved you from this terrific

     "No, Mr. Murdoch. I was already upon the track, and had I been out as

     experience."

     "I am an omnivorous reader with a strangely retentive memory for
     trifles. That phrase 'the Lion's Mane' haunted my mind. I knew that I
     had seen it somewhere in an unexpected context. You have seen that it
     does describe the creature. I have no doubt that it was floating on

     professional career should have come to me after my retirement, and
     be brought, as it were, to my very door. It occurred after my
     withdrawal to my little Sussex home, when I had given myself up
     entirely to that soothing life of Nature for which I had so often
     yearned during the long years spent amid the gloom of London. At this
==>      period of my life the good Watson had passed almost beyond my ken. An <==
     occasional week-end visit was the most that I ever saw of him. Thus I
     must act as my own chronicler. Ah! had he but been with me, how much
     he might have made of so wonderful a happening and of my eventual
     triumph against every difficulty! As it is, however, I must needs
     tell my tale in my own plain way, showing by my words each step upon

     stood alone by that place of death. Then at last I turned and walked
     slowly homeward.

     I had just reached the top of the path when it came to me. Like a
     flash, I remembered the thing for which I had so eagerly and vainly
==>      grasped. You will know, or Watson has written in vain, that I hold a <==
     vast store of out-of-the-way knowledge without scientific system, but
     very available for the needs of my work. My mind is like a crowded
     box-room with packets of all sorts stowed away therein--so many that
     I may well have but a vague perception of what was there. I had known
     that there was something which might bear upon this matter. It was
