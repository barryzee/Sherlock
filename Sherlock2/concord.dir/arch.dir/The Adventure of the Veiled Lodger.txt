==>      When one considers that Mr. Sherlock Holmes was in active practice <==
     for twenty-three years, and that during seventeen of these I was
     allowed to cooperate with him and to keep notes of his doings, it
     will be clear that I have a mass of material at my command. The
     problem has always been not to find but to choose. There is the long
     row of year-books which fill a shelf, and there are the

     have nothing to fear. The discretion and high sense of professional
     honour which have always distinguished my friend are still at work in
     the choice of these memoirs, and no confidence will be abused. I
     deprecate, however, in the strongest way the attempts which have been
     made lately to get at and to destroy these papers. The source of
==>      these outrages is known, and if they are repeated I have Mr. Holmes's <==
     authority for saying that the whole story concerning the politician,
     the lighthouse, and the trained cormorant will be given to the
     public. There is at least one reader who will understand.

     It is not reasonable to suppose that every one of these cases gave

     authority for saying that the whole story concerning the politician,
     the lighthouse, and the trained cormorant will be given to the
     public. There is at least one reader who will understand.

     It is not reasonable to suppose that every one of these cases gave
==>      Holmes the opportunity of showing those curious gifts of instinct and <==
     observation which I have endeavoured to set forth in these memoirs.
     Sometimes he had with much effort to pick the fruit, sometimes it
     fell easily into his lap. But the most terrible human tragedies were
     often involved in those cases which brought him the fewest personal
     opportunities, and it is one of these which I now desire to record.

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 73849    window = 73844 73854


     opportunities, and it is one of these which I now desire to record.
     In telling it, I have made a slight change of name and place, but
     otherwise the facts are as stated.

     One forenoon--it was late in 1896--I received a hurried note from
==>      Holmes asking for my attendance. When I arrived I found him seated in <==
     a smoke-laden atmosphere, with an elderly, motherly woman of the
     buxom landlady type in the corresponding chair in front of him.

     "This is Mrs. Merrilow, of South Brixton," said my friend with a wave
     of the hand. "Mrs. Merrilow does not object to tobacco, Watson, if

     "You will understand, Mrs. Merrilow, that if I come to Mrs. Ronder I
     should prefer to have a witness. You will make her understand that
     before we arrive."

==>      "Lord bless you, Mr. Holmes," said our visitor, "she is that anxious <==
     to see you that you might bring the whole parish at your heels!"

     "Then we shall come early in the afternoon. Let us see that we have
     our facts correct before we start. If we go over them it will help
     Dr. Watson to understand the situation. You say that Mrs. Ronder has

     "And I wish to God I had not!" said Mrs. Merrilow.

     "It was, I understand, terribly mutilated."

==>      "Well, Mr. Holmes, you would hardly say it was a face at all. That's <==
     how it looked. Our milkman got a glimpse of her once peeping out of
     the upper window, and he dropped his tin and the milk all over the
     front garden. That is the kind of face it is. When I saw her--I
     happened on her unawares--she covered up quick, and then she said,
     'Now, Mrs. Merrilow, you know at last why it is that I never raise my

     "You say that she never showed her face from first to last save on
     the one accidental occasion. Well, it is a very remarkable story,
     most remarkable, and I don't wonder that you want it examined."

==>      "I don't, Mr. Holmes. I am quite satisfied so long as I get my rent. <==
     You could not have a quieter lodger, or one who gives less trouble."

     "Then what has brought matters to a head?"

     "Her health, Mr. Holmes. She seems to be wasting away. And there's

     "I don't, Mr. Holmes. I am quite satisfied so long as I get my rent.
     You could not have a quieter lodger, or one who gives less trouble."

     "Then what has brought matters to a head?"

==>      "Her health, Mr. Holmes. She seems to be wasting away. And there's <==
     something terrible on her mind. 'Murder!' she cries. 'Murder!' And
     once I heard her: 'You cruel beast! You monster!' she cried. It was
     in the night, and it fair rang through the house and sent the shivers
     through me. So I went to her in the morning. 'Mrs. Ronder,' I says,
     'if you have anything that is troubling your soul, there's the

     clergy,' I says, 'and there's the police. Between them you should get
     some help.' 'For God's sake, not the police!' says she, 'and the
     clergy can't change what is past. And yet,' she says, 'it would ease
     my mind if someone knew the truth before I died.' 'Well,' says I, 'if
     you won't have the regulars, there is this detective man what we read
==>      about'--beggin' your pardon, Mr. Holmes. And she, she fair jumped at <==
     it. 'That's the man,' says she. 'I wonder I never thought of it
     before. Bring him here, Mrs. Merrilow, and if he won't come, tell him
     I am the wife of Ronder's wild beast show. Say that, and give him the
     name Abbas Parva. Here it is as she wrote it, Abbas Parva. 'That will
     bring him if he's the man I think he is.'"

     name Abbas Parva. Here it is as she wrote it, Abbas Parva. 'That will

     should like to have a little chat with Dr. Watson. That will carry us
     till lunch-time. About three o'clock you may expect to see us at your
     house in Brixton."

     should like to have a little chat with Dr. Watson. That will carry us

     Our visitor had no sooner waddled out of the room--no other verb can

     threw himself with fierce energy upon the pile of commonplace books
     in the corner. For a few minutes there was a constant swish of the
     leaves, and then with a grunt of satisfaction he came upon what he
     sought. So excited was he that he did not rise, but sat upon the
     floor like some strange Buddha, with crossed legs, the huge books all

     "The case worried me at the time, Watson. Here are my marginal notes
     to prove it. I confess that I could make nothing of it. And yet I was
     convinced that the coroner was wrong. Have you no recollection of the
     Abbas Parva tragedy?"

==>      "None, Holmes." <==

     "And yet you were with me then. But certainly my own impression was
     very superficial. For there was nothing to go by, and none of the
     parties had engaged my services. Perhaps you would care to read the
     papers?"

     having encouraged the beast's rage by turning. If they had faced it
     they might have cowed it. Hence her cries of 'Coward!'"

     "Brilliant, Watson! Only one flaw in your diamond."

==>      "What is the flaw, Holmes?" <==

     "If they were both ten paces from the cage, how came the beast to get
     loose?"

     "Is it possible that they had some enemy who loosed it?"

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 74070    window = 74065 74075


     "And why should it attack them savagely when it was in the habit of
     playing with them, and doing tricks with them inside the cage?"

     "Possibly the same enemy had done something to enrage it."

==>      Holmes looked thoughtful and remained in silence for some moments. <==

     "Well, Watson, there is this to be said for your theory. Ronder was a
     man of many enemies. Edmunds told me that in his cups he was
     horrible. A huge bully of a man, he cursed and slashed at everyone
     who came in his way. I expect those cries about a monster, of which

     was cut off close at her upper lip and disclosed a perfectly shaped
     mouth and a delicately rounded chin. I could well conceive that she
     had indeed been a very remarkable woman. Her voice, too, was well
     modulated and pleasing.

==>      "My name is not unfamiliar to you, Mr. Holmes," said she. "I thought <==
     that it would bring you."

     "That is so, madam, though I do not know how you are aware that I was
     interested in your case."

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 74136    window = 74131 74141



     "You compliment me, madam. At the same time, I am a responsible
     person. I do not promise you that when you have spoken I may not
     myself think it my duty to refer the case to the police."

==>      "I think not, Mr. Holmes. I know your character and methods too well, <==
     for I have followed your work for some years. Reading is the only
     pleasure which fate has left me, and I miss little which passes in
     the world. But in any case, I will take my chance of the use which
     you may make of my tragedy. It will ease my mind to tell it."

     and I was hardly conscious of pain. With the palms of my hands I
     tried to push the great steaming, blood-stained jaws away from me,
     and I screamed for help. I was conscious that the camp was stirring,
     and then dimly I remembered a group of men. Leonardo, Griggs, and
     others, dragging me from under the creature's paws. That was my last
==>      memory, Mr. Holmes, for many a weary month. When I came to myself and <==
     saw myself in the mirror, I cursed that lion--oh, how I cursed
     him!--not because he had torn away my beauty but because he had not
     torn away my life. I had but one desire, Mr. Holmes, and I had enough
     money to gratify it. It was that I should cover myself so that my
     poor face should be seen by none, and that I should dwell where none

     me to do--and that is what I have done. A poor wounded beast that has
     crawled into its hole to die--that is the end of Eugenia Ronder."

     We sat in silence for some time after the unhappy woman had told her
==>      story. Then Holmes stretched out his long arm and patted her hand <==
     with such a show of sympathy as I had seldom known him to exhibit.

     "Poor girl!" he said. "Poor girl! The ways of fate are indeed hard to
     understand. If there is not some compensation hereafter, then the
     world is a cruel jest. But what of this man Leonardo?"

     in the paper."

     "And what did he do with this five-clawed club, which is the most
     singular and ingenious part of all your story?"

==>      "I cannot tell, Mr. Holmes. There is a chalk-pit by the camp, with a <==
     deep green pool at the base of it. Perhaps in the depths of that
     pool--"

     "Well, well, it is of little consequence now. The case is closed."

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 74269    window = 74264 74274


     "Well, well, it is of little consequence now. The case is closed."

     "Yes," said the woman, "the case is closed."

     We had risen to go, but there was something in the woman's voice
==>      which arrested Holmes's attention. He turned swiftly upon her. <==

     "Your life is not your own," he said. "Keep your hands off it."

     "What use is it to anyone?"

     "I wonder if you would bear it," she said.

     It was horrible. No words can describe the framework of a face when
     the face itself is gone. Two living and beautiful brown eyes looking
     sadly out from that grisly ruin did but make the view more awful.
==>      Holmes held up his hand in a gesture of pity and protest, and <==
     together we left the room.

     Two days later, when I called upon my friend, he pointed with some
     pride to a small blue bottle upon his mantelpiece. I picked it up.
     There was a red poison label. A pleasant almondy odour rose when I
