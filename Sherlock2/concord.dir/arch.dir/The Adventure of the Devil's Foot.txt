     In recording from time to time some of the curious experiences and
     interesting recollections which I associate with my long and intimate
==>      friendship with Mr. Sherlock Holmes, I have continually been faced by <==
     difficulties caused by his own aversion to publicity. To his sombre
     and cynical spirit all popular applause was always abhorrent, and
     nothing amused him more at the end of a successful case than to hand
     over the actual exposure to some orthodox official, and to listen
     with a mocking smile to the general chorus of misplaced

     fresh to his mind, or what freak had caused him to desire that I
     should recount it; but I hasten, before another cancelling telegram
     may arrive, to hunt out the notes which give me the exact details of
     the case and to lay the narrative before my readers.

==>      It was, then, in the spring of the year 1897 that Holmes's iron <==
     constitution showed some symptoms of giving way in the face of
     constant hard work of a most exacting kind, aggravated, perhaps, by
     occasional indiscretions of his own. In March of that year Dr. Moore
     Agar, of Harley Street, whose dramatic introduction to Holmes I may
     some day recount, gave positive injunctions that the famous private

     if he wished to avert an absolute breakdown. The state of his health
     was not a matter in which he himself took the faintest interest, for
     his mental detachment was absolute, but he was induced at last, on

     I have said that scattered towers marked the villages which dotted
     this part of Cornwall. The nearest of these was the hamlet of
     Tredannick Wollas, where the cottages of a couple of hundred
     inhabitants clustered round an ancient, moss-grown church. The vicar
     of the parish, Mr. Roundhay, was something of an archaeologist, and
==>      as such Holmes had made his acquaintance. He was a middle-aged man, <==
     portly and affable, with a considerable fund of local lore. At his
     invitation we had taken tea at the vicarage and had come to know,
     also, Mr. Mortimer Tregennis, an independent gentleman, who increased
     the clergyman's scanty resources by taking rooms in his large,
     straggling house. The vicar, being a bachelor, was glad to come to

     These were the two men who entered abruptly into our little
     sitting-room on Tuesday, March the 16th, shortly after our breakfast
     hour, as we were smoking together, preparatory to our daily excursion
     upon the moors.

==>      "Mr. Holmes," said the vicar in an agitated voice, "the most <==
     extraordinary and tragic affair has occurred during the night. It is
     the most unheard-of business. We can only regard it as a special
     Providence that you should chance to be here at the time, for in all
     England you are the one man we need."

     the most unheard-of business. We can only regard it as a special
     Providence that you should chance to be here at the time, for in all
     England you are the one man we need."

     I glared at the intrusive vicar with no very friendly eyes; but
==>      Holmes took his pipe from his lips and sat up in his chair like an <==
     old hound who hears the view-halloa. He waved his hand to the sofa,
     and our palpitating visitor with his agitated companion sat side by
     side upon it. Mr. Mortimer Tregennis was more self-contained than the
     clergyman, but the twitching of his thin hands and the brightness of
     his dark eyes showed that they shared a common emotion.

     "Shall I speak or you?" he asked of the vicar.

     "Well, as you seem to have made the discovery, whatever it may be,
     and the vicar to have had it second-hand, perhaps you had better do
==>      the speaking," said Holmes. <==

     I glanced at the hastily clad clergyman, with the formally dressed
     lodger seated beside him, and was amused at the surprise which
     Holmes's simple deduction had brought to their faces.

     "Perhaps I had best say a few words first," said the vicar, "and then
     you can judge if you will listen to the details from Mr. Tregennis,
     or whether we should not hasten at once to the scene of this
     mysterious affair. I may explain, then, that our friend here spent

     upon. There was no sign of the presence of anyone in the house,
     except Mrs. Porter, the old cook and housekeeper, who declared that
     she had slept deeply and heard no sound during the night. Nothing had
     been stolen or disarranged, and there is absolutely no explanation of
     what the horror can be which has frightened a woman to death and two
==>      strong men out of their senses. There is the situation, Mr. Holmes, <==
     in a nutshell, and if you can help us to clear it up you will have
     done a great work."

     I had hoped that in some way I could coax my companion back into the
     quiet which had been the object of our journey; but one glance at his

     "I will look into this matter," he said at last. "On the face of it,
     it would appear to be a case of a very exceptional nature. Have you
     been there yourself, Mr. Roundhay?"

==>      "No, Mr. Holmes. Mr. Tregennis brought back the account to the <==
     vicarage, and I at once hurried over with him to consult you."

     "How far is it to the house where this singular tragedy occurred?"

     "About a mile inland."

     a few questions, Mr. Mortimer Tregennis."

     The other had been silent all this time, but I had observed that his
     more controlled excitement was even greater than the obtrusive
     emotion of the clergyman. He sat with a pale, drawn face, his anxious
==>      gaze fixed upon Holmes, and his thin hands clasped convulsively <==
     together. His pale lips quivered as he listened to the dreadful
     experience which had befallen his family, and his dark eyes seemed to
     reflect something of the horror of the scene.

     "Ask what you like, Mr. Holmes," said he eagerly. "It is a bad thing

     "Tell me about last night."

     elder brother George proposed a game of whist afterwards. We sat down
     about nine o'clock. It was a quarter-past ten when I moved to go. I
     left them all round the table, as merry as could be."

     "Who let you out?"

     and Brenda lying dead of fright, with her head hanging over the arm
     of the chair. I'll never get the sight of that room out of my mind so
     long as I live."

     "The facts, as you state them, are certainly most remarkable," said
==>      Holmes. "I take it that you have no theory yourself which can in any <==
     way account for them?"

     "It's devilish, Mr. Holmes, devilish!" cried Mortimer Tregennis. "It
     is not of this world. Something has come into that room which has

==>      "I fear," said Holmes, "that if the matter is beyond humanity it is <==
     certainly beyond me. Yet we must exhaust all natural explanations
     before we fall back upon such a theory as this. As to yourself, Mr.
     Tregennis, I take it you were divided in some way from your family,
     since they lived together and you had rooms apart?"

     certainly beyond me. Yet we must exhaust all natural explanations
     before we fall back upon such a theory as this. As to yourself, Mr.
     Tregennis, I take it you were divided in some way from your family,
     since they lived together and you had rooms apart?"

==>      "That is so, Mr. Holmes, though the matter is past and done with. We <==
     were a family of tin-miners at Redruth, but we sold our venture to a
     company, and so retired with enough to keep us. I won't deny that
     there was some feeling about the division of the money and it stood
     between us for a time, but it was all forgiven and forgotten, and we
     were the best of friends together."

     and Owen were singing snatches of songs and gibbering like two great
     apes. Oh, it was awful to see! I couldn't stand it, and the doctor
     was as white as a sheet. Indeed, he fell into a chair in a sort of
     faint, and we nearly had him on our hands as well."

==>      "Remarkable--most remarkable!" said Holmes, rising and taking his <==
     hat. "I think, perhaps, we had better go down to Tredannick Wartha
     without further delay. I confess that I have seldom known a case
     which at first sight presented a more singular problem."

     Our proceedings of that first morning did little to advance the

     It was a large and bright dwelling, rather a villa than a cottage,
     with a considerable garden which was already, in that Cornish air,
     well filled with spring flowers. Towards this garden the window of
     the sitting-room fronted, and from it, according to Mortimer
     Tregennis, must have come that thing of evil which had by sheer
==>      horror in a single instant blasted their minds. Holmes walked slowly <==
     and thoughtfully among the flower-plots and along the path before we
     entered the porch. So absorbed was he in his thoughts, I remember,
     that he stumbled over the watering-pot, upset its contents, and
     deluged both our feet and the garden path. Inside the house we were
     met by the elderly Cornish housekeeper, Mrs. Porter, who, with the

     entered the porch. So absorbed was he in his thoughts, I remember,
     that he stumbled over the watering-pot, upset its contents, and
     deluged both our feet and the garden path. Inside the house we were
     met by the elderly Cornish housekeeper, Mrs. Porter, who, with the
     aid of a young girl, looked after the wants of the family. She
==>      readily answered all Holmes's questions. She had heard nothing in the <==
     night. Her employers had all been in excellent spirits lately, and
     she had never known them more cheerful and prosperous. She had
     fainted with horror upon entering the room in the morning and seeing
     that dreadful company round the table. She had, when she recovered,
     thrown open the window to let the morning air in, and had run down to

     been her last human emotion. From her bedroom we descended to the
     sitting-room, where this strange tragedy had actually occurred. The
     charred ashes of the overnight fire lay in the grate. On the table
     were the four guttered and burned-out candles, with the cards
     scattered over its surface. The chairs had been moved back against
==>      the walls, but all else was as it had been the night before. Holmes <==
     paced with light, swift steps about the room; he sat in the various
     chairs, drawing them up and reconstructing their positions. He tested
     how much of the garden was visible; he examined the floor, the
     ceiling, and the fireplace; but never once did I see that sudden
     brightening of his eyes and tightening of his lips which would have

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 64408    window = 64403 64413


     "Why a fire?" he asked once. "Had they always a fire in this small
     room on a spring evening?"

     Mortimer Tregennis explained that the night was cold and damp. For
     that reason, after his arrival, the fire was lit. "What are you going
==>      to do now, Mr. Holmes?" he asked. <==

     My friend smiled and laid his hand upon my arm. "I think, Watson,
     that I shall resume that course of tobacco-poisoning which you have
     so often and so justly condemned," said he. "With your permission,
     gentlemen, we will now return to our cottage, for I am not aware that

     facts over in my mid, Mr, Tregennis, and should anything occur to me
     I will certainly ommunicate with you and the vicar. In the meantime I
     wish you both good-morning."

     It was not until long after we were back in Poldhu Cottage that
==>      Holmes broke his complete and absorbed silence. He sat coiled in his <==
     armchair, his haggard and ascetic face hardly visible amid the blue
     swirl of his tobacco smoke, his black brows drawn down, his forehead
     contracted, his eyes vacant and far away. Finally he laid down his
     pipe and sprang to his feet.

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 64482    window = 64477 64487


     difficulties, Watson?"

     "They are only too clear," I answered with conviction.

     "And yet, with a little more material, we may prove that they are not
==>      insurmountable," said Holmes. "I fancy that among your extensive <==
     archives, Watson, you may find some which were nearly as obscure.
     Meanwhile, we shall put the case aside until more accurate data are
     available, and devote the rest of our morning to the pursuit of
     neolithic man."

     caused him to spend the greater part of the intervals between his
     journeys in a small bungalow buried in the lonely wood of Beauchamp
     Arriance. Here, amid his books and his maps, he lived an absolutely
     lonely life, attending to his own simple wants and paying little
     apparent heed to the affairs of his neighbours. It was a surprise to
==>      me, therefore, to hear him asking Holmes in an eager voice whether he <==
     had made any advance in his reconstruction of this mysterious
     episode. "The county police are utterly at fault," said he, "but
     perhaps your wider experience has suggested some conceivable
     explanation. My only claim to being taken into your confidence is
     that during my many residences here I have come to know this family

     call them cousins--and their strange fate has naturally been a great
     shock to me. I may tell you that I had got as far as Plymouth upon my
     way to Africa, but the news reached me this morning, and I came
     straight back again to help in the inquiry."

==>      Holmes raised his eyebrows. <==

     "Did you lose your boat through it?"

     "I will take the next."

     "Might I ask from whom?"

     A shadow passed over the gaunt face of the explorer.

==>      "You are very inquisitive, Mr. Holmes." <==

     "It is my business."

     With an effort Dr. Sterndale recovered his ruffled composure.


[line number in individual story] matching line = 504    window = 499 509

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 64556    window = 64551 64561


     With an effort Dr. Sterndale recovered his ruffled composure.

     "I have no objection to telling you," he said. "It was Mr. Roundhay,
     the vicar, who sent me the telegram which recalled me."

==>      "Thank you," said Holmes. "I may say in answer to your original <==
     question that I have not cleared my mind entirely on the subject of
     this case, but that I have every hope of reaching some conclusion. It
     would be premature to say more."

     "Perhaps you would not mind telling me if your suspicions point in

     "No, I can hardly answer that."

     "Then I have wasted my time and need not prolong my visit." The
     famous doctor strode out of our cottage in considerable ill-humour,
==>      and within five minutes Holmes had followed him. I saw him no more <==
     until the evening, when he returned with a slow step and haggard face
     which assured me that he had made no great progress with his
     investigation. He glanced at a telegram which awaited him and threw
     it into the grate.

     "Deeply interested--yes. There is a thread here which we had not yet
     grasped and which might lead us through the tangle. Cheer up, Watson,
     for I am very sure that our material has not yet all come to hand.
     When it does we may soon leave our difficulties behind us."

==>      Little did I think how soon the words of Holmes would be realized, or <==
     how strange and sinister would be that new development which opened
     up an entirely fresh line of investigation. I was shaving at my
     window in the morning when I heard the rattle of hoofs and, looking
     up, saw a dog-cart coming at a gallop down the road. It pulled up at
     our door, and our friend, the vicar, sprang from it and rushed up our

     Our visitor was so excited that he could hardly articulate, but at

     Our visitor was so excited that he could hardly articulate, but at
     last in gasps and bursts his tragic story came out of him.

     cried. "Satan himself is loose in it! We are given over into his
     hands!" He danced about in his agitation, a ludicrous object if it
     were not for his ashy face and startled eyes. Finally he shot out his
     terrible news.

     terrible news.

     "Mr. Mortimer Tregennis died during the night, and with exactly the
     same symptoms as the rest of his family."

==>      Holmes sprang to his feet, all energy in an instant. <==

     "Can you fit us both into your dog-cart?"

     "Yes, I can."

     contorted as though he had died in a very paroxysm of fear. He was
     fully clothed, though there were signs that his dressing had been
     done in a hurry. We had already learned that his bed had been slept
     in, and that the tragic end had come to him in the early morning.

     moment that he entered the fatal apartment. In an instant he was
     tense and alert, his eyes shining, his face set, his limbs quivering
     with eager activity. He was out on the lawn, in through the window,
     round the room, and up into the bedroom, for all the world like a

     employed elsewhere."

     It may be that the police resented the intrusion of an amateur, or
     that they imagined themselves to be upon some hopeful line of
     investigation; but it is certain that we heard nothing from them for
==>      the next two days. During this time Holmes spent some of his time <==
     smoking and dreaming in the cottage; but a greater portion in country
     walks which he undertook alone, returning after many hours without
     remark as to where he had been. One experiment served to show me the
     line of his investigation. He had bought a lamp which was the
     duplicate of the one which had burned in the room of Mortimer

     There, sure enough, I perceived a number of flaky ashes, and round
     the edges a fringe of brownish powder, which had not yet been
     consumed. Half of this I took, as you saw, and I placed it in an
     envelope."

==>      "Why half, Holmes?" <==

     "It is not for me, my dear Watson, to stand in the way of the
     official police force. I leave them all the evidence which I found.
     The poison still remained upon the talc had they the wit to find it.
     Now, Watson, we will light our lamp; we will, however, take the

     eyes were protruding, that my mouth was opened, and my tongue like
     leather. The turmoil within my brain was such that something must
     surely snap. I tried to scream and was vaguely aware of some hoarse
     croak which was my own voice, but distant and detached from myself.
     At the same moment, in some effort of escape, I broke through that
==>      cloud of despair and had a glimpse of Holmes's face, white, rigid, <==
     and drawn with horror--the very look which I had seen upon the
     features of the dead. It was that vision which gave me an instant of
     sanity and of strength. I dashed from my chair, threw my arms round
     Holmes, and together we lurched through the door, and an instant
     afterwards had thrown ourselves down upon the grass plot and were

     us in. Slowly it rose from our souls like the mists from a landscape
     until peace and reason had returned, and we were sitting upon the

     until peace and reason had returned, and we were sitting upon the
     grass, wiping our clammy foreheads, and looking with apprehension at
     each other to mark the last traces of that terrific experience which
     we had undergone.

==>      "Upon my word, Watson!" said Holmes at last with an unsteady voice, <==
     "I owe you both my thanks and an apology. It was an unjustifiable
     experiment even for one's self, and doubly so for a friend. I am
     really very sorry."

     "You know," I answered with some emotion, for I have never seen so

     He relapsed at once into the half-humorous, half-cynical vein which
     was his habitual attitude to those about him. "It would be
     superfluous to drive us mad, my dear Watson," said he. "A candid

     I had heard the click of the garden gate, and now the majestic figure
     of the great African explorer appeared upon the path. He turned in
     some surprise towards the rustic arbour in which we sat.

==>      "You sent for me, Mr. Holmes. I had your note about an hour ago, and <==
     I have come, though I really do not know why I should obey your
     summons."

     "Perhaps we can clear the point up before we separate," said Holmes.
     "Meanwhile, I am much obliged to you for your courteous acquiescence.

     companion.

     "I am at a loss to know, sir," he said, "what you can have to speak
     about which affects me personally in a very intimate fashion."

==>      "The killing of Mortimer Tregennis," said Holmes. <==

     For a moment I wished that I were armed. Sterndale's fierce face
     turned to a dusky red, his eyes glared, and the knotted, passionate
     veins started out in his forehead, while he sprang forward with
     clenched hands towards my companion. Then he stopped, and with a

     violent effort he resumed a cold, rigid calmness, which was, perhaps,
     more suggestive of danger than his hot-headed outburst.

     "I have lived so long among savages and beyond the law," said he,
     "that I have got into the way of being a law to myself. You would do
==>      well, Mr. Holmes, not to forget it, for I have no desire to do you an <==
     injury."

     "Nor have I any desire to do you an injury, Dr. Sterndale. Surely the

     you and not for the police."

     clearest proof of it is that, knowing what I know, I have sent for

     Sterndale sat down with a gasp, overawed for, perhaps, the first time
     in his adventurous life. There was a calm assurance of power in
==>      Holmes's manner which could not be withstood. Our visitor stammered <==
     for a moment, his great hands opening and shutting in his agitation.

     "What do you mean?" he asked at last. "If this is bluff upon your
     part, Mr. Holmes, you have chosen a bad man for your experiment. Let
     us have no more beating about the bush. What do you mean?"

     Sterndale mopped his forehead with his handkerchief. "Upon my word,

     prodigious power of bluff?"

     restless night at your cottage, and you formed certain plans, which
     in the early morning you proceeded to put into execution. Leaving
     your door just as day was breaking, you filled your pocket with some
     reddish gravel that was lying heaped beside your gate."

     "You then walked swiftly for the mile which separated you from the
     vicarage. You were wearing, I may remark, the same pair of ribbed
     tennis shoes which are at the present moment upon your feet. At the

     Sterndale sprang to his feet.

     come down. He dressed hurriedly and descended to his sitting-room.
     You entered by the window. There was an interview--a short
     one--during which you walked up and down the room. Then you passed
     out and closed the window, standing on the lawn outside smoking a

     photograph from his breast-pocket and threw it on the rustic table
     before us.

     "That is why I have done it," said he.

==>      It showed the bust and face of a very beautiful woman. Holmes stooped <==
     over it.

     "Brenda Tregennis," said he.

     "Yes, Brenda Tregennis," repeated our visitor. "For years I have

     "The vicar knew. He was in our confidence. He would tell you that she

     such a fate had come upon my darling? There you have the missing clue

     "Proceed," said my friend.

     Dr. Sterndale drew from his pocket a paper packet and laid it upon
     the table. On the outside was written "Radix pedis diaboli" with a

     very extraordinary circumstances in the Ubangi country." He opened
     the paper as he spoke and disclosed a heap of reddish-brown,
     snuff-like powder.

     "I am about to tell you, Mr. Holmes, all that actually occurred, for

     facts were true, but could I help to make a jury of countrymen

     the law, and that I have come at last to be a law to myself. So it
     was even now. I determined that the fate which he had given to others
     should be shared by himself. Either that or I would do justice upon
     him with my own hand. In all England there can be no man who sets
     less value upon his own life than I do at the present moment.

     above it, and stood outside the window, ready to carry out my threat
     to shoot him should he try to leave the room. In five minutes he
     died. My God! how he died! But my heart was flint, for he endured
     nothing which my innocent darling had not felt before him. There is

     done as much yourself. At any rate, I am in your hands. You can take
     what steps you like. As I have already said, there is no man living
     who can fear death less than I do."

     "They are only too clear," I answered with conviction.

     "And yet, with a little more material, we may prove that they are not
     insurmountable," said Holmes. "I fancy that among your extensive
==>      archives, Watson, you may find some which were nearly as obscure. <==
     Meanwhile, we shall put the case aside until more accurate data are
     available, and devote the rest of our morning to the pursuit of
     neolithic man."

     I may have commented upon my friend's power of mental detachment, but

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 64574    window = 64569 64579


     until the evening, when he returned with a slow step and haggard face
     which assured me that he had made no great progress with his
     investigation. He glanced at a telegram which awaited him and threw
     it into the grate.

==>      "From the Plymouth hotel, Watson," he said. "I learned the name of it <==
     from the vicar, and I wired to make certain that Dr. Leon Sterndale's
     account was true. It appears that he did indeed spend last night
     there, and that he has actually allowed some of his baggage to go on
     to Africa, while he returned to be present at this investigation.
     What do you make of that, Watson?"

[line number in individual story] matching line = 527    window = 522 532

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 64579    window = 64574 64584


     "From the Plymouth hotel, Watson," he said. "I learned the name of it
     from the vicar, and I wired to make certain that Dr. Leon Sterndale's
     account was true. It appears that he did indeed spend last night
     there, and that he has actually allowed some of his baggage to go on
     to Africa, while he returned to be present at this investigation.
==>      What do you make of that, Watson?" <==

     "He is deeply interested."

     "Deeply interested--yes. There is a thread here which we had not yet
     grasped and which might lead us through the tangle. Cheer up, Watson,

[line number in individual story] matching line = 532    window = 527 537

     "Deeply interested--yes. There is a thread here which we had not yet
==>      grasped and which might lead us through the tangle. Cheer up, Watson, <==
     for I am very sure that our material has not yet all come to hand.
     When it does we may soon leave our difficulties behind us."

     Little did I think how soon the words of Holmes would be realized, or
     how strange and sinister would be that new development which opened

[line number in individual story] matching line = 563    window = 558 568

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 64615    window = 64610 64620



     "Can you fit us both into your dog-cart?"

     "Yes, I can."

==>      "Then, Watson, we will postpone our breakfast. Mr. Roundhay, we are <==
     entirely at your disposal. Hurry--hurry, before things get
     disarranged."

     The lodger occupied two rooms at the vicarage, which were in an angle
     by themselves, the one above the other. Below was a large

[line number in individual story] matching line = 618    window = 613 623

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 64670    window = 64665 64675


     police, but I should be exceedingly obliged, Mr. Roundhay, if you
     would give the inspector my compliments and direct his attention to
     the bedroom window and to the sitting-room lamp. Each is suggestive,
     and together they are almost conclusive. If the police would desire
     further information I shall be happy to see any of them at the
==>      cottage. And now, Watson, I think that, perhaps, we shall be better <==
     employed elsewhere."

     It may be that the police resented the intrusion of an amateur, or
     that they imagined themselves to be upon some hopeful line of
     investigation; but it is certain that we heard nothing from them for

[line number in individual story] matching line = 636    window = 631 641

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 64688    window = 64683 64693


     oil as that used at the vicarage, and he carefully timed the period
     which it would take to be exhausted. Another experiment which he made
     was of a more unpleasant nature, and one which I am not likely ever
     to forget.

==>      "You will remember, Watson," he remarked one afternoon, "that there <==
     is a single common point of resemblance in the varying reports which
     have reached us. This concerns the effect of the atmosphere of the
     room in each case upon those who had first entered it. You will
     recollect that Mortimer Tregennis, in describing the episode of his
     last visit to his brother's house, remarked that the doctor on

[line number in individual story] matching line = 650    window = 645 655

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 64702    window = 64697 64707


     entering the room and had afterwards opened the window. In the second
     case--that of Mortimer Tregennis himself--you cannot have forgotten
     the horrible stuffiness of the room when we arrived, though the
     servant had thrown open the window. That servant, I found upon
     inquiry, was so ill that she had gone to her bed. You will admit,
==>      Watson, that these facts are very suggestive. In each case there is <==
     evidence of a poisonous atmosphere. In each case, also, there is
     combustion going on in the room--in the one case a fire, in the other
     a lamp. The fire was needed, but the lamp was lit--as a comparison of
     the oil consumed will show--long after it was broad daylight. Why?
     Surely because there is some connection between three things--the

[line number in individual story] matching line = 686    window = 681 691

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 64738    window = 64733 64743


     consumed. Half of this I took, as you saw, and I placed it in an
     envelope."

     "Why half, Holmes?"

==>      "It is not for me, my dear Watson, to stand in the way of the <==
     official police force. I leave them all the evidence which I found.
     The poison still remained upon the talc had they the wit to find it.
     Now, Watson, we will light our lamp; we will, however, take the
     precaution to open our window to avoid the premature decease of two
     deserving members of society, and you will seat yourself near that

     symptoms seem alarming. Is that all clear? Well, then, I take our

==>      the burning lamp. So! Now, Watson, let us sit down and await <==
     developments."

     They were not long in coming. I had hardly settled in my chair before
     I was conscious of a thick, musky odour, subtle and nauseous. At the
     very first whiff of it my brain and my imagination were beyond all

[line number in individual story] matching line = 733    window = 728 738

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 64785    window = 64780 64790


     until peace and reason had returned, and we were sitting upon the
     grass, wiping our clammy foreheads, and looking with apprehension at
     each other to mark the last traces of that terrific experience which
     we had undergone.

==>      "Upon my word, Watson!" said Holmes at last with an unsteady voice, <==
     "I owe you both my thanks and an apology. It was an unjustifiable
     experiment even for one's self, and doubly so for a friend. I am
     really very sorry."

     "You know," I answered with some emotion, for I have never seen so

[line number in individual story] matching line = 744    window = 739 749

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 64796    window = 64791 64801


     much of Holmes's heart before, "that it is my greatest joy and
     privilege to help you."

     He relapsed at once into the half-humorous, half-cynical vein which
     was his habitual attitude to those about him. "It would be
==>      superfluous to drive us mad, my dear Watson," said he. "A candid <==
     observer would certainly declare that we were so already before we
     embarked upon so wild an experiment. I confess that I never imagined
     that the effect could be so sudden and so severe." He dashed into the
     cottage, and, reappearing with the burning lamp held at full arm's
     length, he threw it among a bank of brambles. "We must give the room

     observer would certainly declare that we were so already before we
     embarked upon so wild an experiment. I confess that I never imagined
     that the effect could be so sudden and so severe." He dashed into the
     cottage, and, reappearing with the burning lamp held at full arm's
     length, he threw it among a bank of brambles. "We must give the room
==>      a little time to clear. I take it, Watson, that you have no longer a <==
     shadow of a doubt as to how these tragedies were produced?"

     "None whatever."

     "But the cause remains as obscure as before. Come into the arbour

[line number in individual story] matching line = 779    window = 774 784

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 64831    window = 64826 64836


     night. We may take it, then, that all the evidence points to Mortimer
     Tregennis as the culprit."

     "Then his own death was suicide!"

==>      "Well, Watson, it is on the face of it a not impossible supposition. <==
     The man who had the guilt upon his soul of having brought such a fate
     upon his own family might well be driven by remorse to inflict it
     upon himself. There are, however, some cogent reasons against it.
     Fortunately, there is one man in England who knows all about it, and
     I have made arrangements by which we shall hear the facts this

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 64854    window = 64849 64859


     summons."

     "Perhaps we can clear the point up before we separate," said Holmes.
     "Meanwhile, I am much obliged to you for your courteous acquiescence.
     You will excuse this informal reception in the open air, but my
==>      friend Watson and I have nearly furnished an additional chapter to <==
     what the papers call the Cornish Horror, and we prefer a clear
     atmosphere for the present. Perhaps, since the matters which we have
     to discuss will affect you personally in a very intimate fashion, it
     is as well that we should talk where there can be no eavesdropping."

     Dr. Sterndale raised his giant figure, bowed gravely, and walked from
     the arbour. Holmes lit his pipe and handed me his pouch.

     "Some fumes which are not poisonous would be a welcome change," said
==>      he. "I think you must agree, Watson, that it is not a case in which <==
     we are called upon to interfere. Our investigation has been
     independent, and our action shall be so also. You would not denounce
     the man?"

     "Certainly not," I answered.

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 65104    window = 65099 65109


     independent, and our action shall be so also. You would not denounce
     the man?"

     "Certainly not," I answered.

==>      "I have never loved, Watson, but if I did and if the woman I loved <==
     had met such an end, I might act even as our lawless lion-hunter has
     done. Who knows? Well, Watson, I will not offend your intelligence by
     explaining what is obvious. The gravel upon the window-sill was, of
     course, the starting-point of my research. It was unlike anything in

     are surely to be traced in the Cornish branch of the great Celtic
     speech."
