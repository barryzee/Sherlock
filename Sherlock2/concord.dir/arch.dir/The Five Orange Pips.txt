==>      When I glance over my notes and records of the Sherlock Holmes cases <==
     between the years '82 and '90, I am faced by so many which present
     strange and interesting features that it is no easy matter to know
     which to choose and which to leave. Some, however, have already
     gained publicity through the papers, and others have not offered a
     field for those peculiar qualities which my friend possessed in so

     Paradol Chamber, of the Amateur Mendicant Society, who held a
     luxurious club in the lower vault of a furniture warehouse, of the
     facts connected with the loss of the British barque "Sophy Anderson",
     of the singular adventures of the Grice Patersons in the island of
     Uffa, and finally of the Camberwell poisoning case. In the latter, as
==>      may be remembered, Sherlock Holmes was able, by winding up the dead <==
     man's watch, to prove that it had been wound up two hours before, and
     that therefore the deceased had gone to bed within that time--a
     deduction which was of the greatest importance in clearing up the
     case. All these I may sketch out at some future date, but none of
     them present such singular features as the strange train of

     heart of great, hand-made London we were forced to raise our minds
     for the instant from the routine of life and to recognise the
     presence of those great elemental forces which shriek at mankind
     through the bars of his civilisation, like untamed beasts in a cage.
     As evening drew in, the storm grew higher and louder, and the wind
==>      cried and sobbed like a child in the chimney. Sherlock Holmes sat <==
     moodily at one side of the fireplace cross-indexing his records of
     crime, while I at the other was deep in one of Clark Russell's fine
     sea-stories until the howl of the gale from without seemed to blend
     with the text, and the splash of the rain to lengthen out into the
     long swash of the sea waves. My wife was on a visit to her mother's,

     "If so, it is a serious case. Nothing less would bring a man out on
     such a day and at such an hour. But I take it that it is more likely
     to be some crony of the landlady's."

==>      Sherlock Holmes was wrong in his conjecture, however, for there came <==
     a step in the passage and a tapping at the door. He stretched out his
     long arm to turn the lamp away from himself and towards the vacant
     chair upon which a newcomer must sit.

     "Come in!" said he.

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 13294    window = 13289 13299



     "I owe you an apology," he said, raising his golden pince-nez to his
     eyes. "I trust that I am not intruding. I fear that I have brought
     some traces of the storm and rain into your snug chamber."

==>      "Give me your coat and umbrella," said Holmes. "They may rest here on <==
     the hook and will be dry presently. You have come up from the
     south-west, I see."

     "Yes, from Horsham."

     "And help."

     "That is not always so easy."

==>      "I have heard of you, Mr. Holmes. I heard from Major Prendergast how <==
     you saved him in the Tankerville Club scandal."

     "Ah, of course. He was wrongfully accused of cheating at cards."

     "He said that you could solve anything."

     "And yet I question, sir, whether, in all your experience, you have
     ever listened to a more mysterious and inexplicable chain of events
     than those which have happened in my own family."

==>      "You fill me with interest," said Holmes. "Pray give us the essential <==
     facts from the commencement, and I can afterwards question you as to
     those details which seem to me to be most important."

     The young man pulled his chair up and pushed his wet feet out towards
     the blaze.

[line number in individual story] matching line = 252    window = 247 257

     it behind him, like a man who can brazen it out no longer against the
     terror which lies at the roots of his soul. At such times I have seen
     his face, even on a cold day, glisten with moisture, as though it
     were new raised from a basin.

==>      "Well, to come to an end of the matter, Mr. Holmes, and not to abuse <==
     your patience, there came a night when he made one of those drunken
     sallies from which he never came back. We found him, when we went to
     search for him, face downward in a little green-scummed pool, which
     lay at the foot of the garden. There was no sign of any violence, and
     the water was but two feet deep, so that the jury, having regard to

     knew how he winced from the very thought of death, had much ado to
     persuade myself that he had gone out of his way to meet it. The
     matter passed, however, and my father entered into possession of the
     estate, and of some Â£14,000, which lay to his credit at the bank."

==>      "One moment," Holmes interposed, "your statement is, I foresee, one <==
     of the most remarkable to which I have ever listened. Let me have the
     date of the reception by your uncle of the letter, and the date of
     his supposed suicide."

     "The letter arrived on March 10, 1883. His death was seven weeks

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 13587    window = 13582 13592


     "This is the envelope," he continued. "The postmark is
     London--eastern division. Within are the very words which were upon
     my father's last message: 'K. K. K.'; and then 'Put the papers on the
     sundial.'"

==>      "What have you done?" asked Holmes. <==

     "Nothing."

     "Nothing?"


[line number in individual story] matching line = 389    window = 384 394

     have felt helpless. I have felt like one of those poor rabbits when
     the snake is writhing towards it. I seem to be in the grasp of some
     resistless, inexorable evil, which no foresight and no precautions
     can guard against."

==>      "Tut! tut!" cried Sherlock Holmes. "You must act, man, or you are <==
     lost. Nothing but energy can save you. This is no time for despair."

     "I have seen the police."

     "Ah!"

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 13611    window = 13606 13616


     "But they listened to my story with a smile. I am convinced that the
     inspector has formed the opinion that the letters are all practical
     jokes, and that the deaths of my relations were really accidents, as
     the jury stated, and were not to be connected with the warnings."

==>      Holmes shook his clenched hands in the air. "Incredible imbecility!" <==
     he cried.

     "They have, however, allowed me a policeman, who may remain in the
     house with me."

     "Has he come with you to-night?"

     "No. His orders were to stay in the house."

==>      Again Holmes raved in the air. <==

     "Why did you come to me," he cried, "and, above all, why did you not
     come at once?"

     "I did not know. It was only to-day that I spoke to Major Prendergast

[line number in individual story] matching line = 435    window = 430 440

     which has, perhaps, fluttered out from among the others, and in that
     way has escaped destruction. Beyond the mention of pips, I do not see
     that it helps us much. I think myself that it is a page from some
     private diary. The writing is undoubtedly my uncle's."

==>      Holmes moved the lamp, and we both bent over the sheet of paper, <==
     which showed by its ragged edge that it had indeed been torn from a
     book. It was headed, "March, 1869," and beneath were the following
     enigmatical notices:



[line number in individual story] matching line = 448    window = 443 453

     Augustine.
     9th. McCauley cleared.
     10th. John Swain cleared.
     12th. Visited Paramore. All well.

==>      "Thank you!" said Holmes, folding up the paper and returning it to <==
     our visitor. "And now you must on no account lose another instant. We
     cannot spare time even to discuss what you have told me. You must get
     home instantly and act."

     "What shall I do?"

[line number in individual story] matching line = 500    window = 495 505

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 13710    window = 13705 13715


     wind still screamed and the rain splashed and pattered against the
     windows. This strange, wild story seemed to have come to us from amid
     the mad elements--blown in upon us like a sheet of sea-weed in a
     gale--and now to have been reabsorbed by them once more.

==>      Sherlock Holmes sat for some time in silence, with his head sunk <==
     forward and his eyes bent upon the red glow of the fire. Then he lit
     his pipe, and leaning back in his chair he watched the blue
     smoke-rings as they chased each other up to the ceiling.

     "I think, Watson," he remarked at last, "that of all our cases we

     "There can be no question as to their nature," he answered.

     "Then what are they? Who is this K. K. K., and why does he pursue
     this unhappy family?"

==>      Sherlock Holmes closed his eyes and placed his elbows upon the arms <==
     of his chair, with his finger-tips together. "The ideal reasoner," he
     remarked, "would, when he had once been shown a single fact in all
     its bearings, deduce from it not only all the chain of events which
     led up to it but also all the results which would follow from it. As
     Cuvier could correctly describe a whole animal by the contemplation

     within fifty miles of town, chemistry eccentric, anatomy
     unsystematic, sensational literature and crime records unique,
     violin-player, boxer, swordsman, lawyer, and self-poisoner by cocaine
     and tobacco. Those, I think, were the main points of my analysis."

==>      Holmes grinned at the last item. "Well," he said, "I say now, as I <==
     said then, that a man should keep his little brain-attic stocked with
     all the furniture that he is likely to use, and the rest he can put
     away in the lumber-room of his library, where he can get it if he
     wants it. Now, for such a case as the one which has been submitted to
     us to-night, we need certainly to muster all our resources. Kindly

     K. ceases to be the initials of an individual and becomes the badge
     of a society."

     "But of what society?"

==>      "Have you never--" said Sherlock Holmes, bending forward and sinking <==
     his voice--"have you never heard of the Ku Klux Klan?"

     "I never have."

     Holmes turned over the leaves of the book upon his knee. "Here it

     "Have you never--" said Sherlock Holmes, bending forward and sinking
     his voice--"have you never heard of the Ku Klux Klan?"

     "I never have."

==>      Holmes turned over the leaves of the book upon his knee. "Here it <==
     is," said he presently:

     "'Ku Klux Klan. A name derived from the fanciful resemblance to the
     sound produced by cocking a rifle. This terrible secret society was
     formed by some ex-Confederate soldiers in the Southern states after

     United States government and of the better classes of the community
     in the South. Eventually, in the year 1869, the movement rather
     suddenly collapsed, although there have been sporadic outbreaks of
     the same sort since that date.'

==>      "You will observe," said Holmes, laying down the volume, "that the <==
     sudden breaking up of the society was coincident with the
     disappearance of Openshaw from America with their papers. It may well
     have been cause and effect. It is no wonder that he and his family
     have some of the more implacable spirits upon their track. You can
     understand that this register and diary may implicate some of the

     let us try to forget for half an hour the miserable weather and the
     still more miserable ways of our fellow-men."

     It had cleared in the morning, and the sun was shining with a subdued
     brightness through the dim veil which hangs over the great city.
==>      Sherlock Holmes was already at breakfast when I came down. <==

     "You will excuse me for not waiting for you," said he; "I have, I
     foresee, a very busy day before me in looking into this case of young
     Openshaw's."

     As I waited, I lifted the unopened newspaper from the table and
     glanced my eye over it. It rested upon a heading which sent a chill
     to my heart.

==>      "Holmes," I cried, "you are too late." <==

     "Ah!" said he, laying down his cup, "I feared as much. How was it
     done?" He spoke calmly, but I could see that he was deeply moved.

     "My eye caught the name of Openshaw, and the heading 'Tragedy Near

     can be no doubt that the deceased had been the victim of an
     unfortunate accident, which should have the effect of calling the
     attention of the authorities to the condition of the riverside
     landing-stages."

==>      We sat in silence for some minutes, Holmes more depressed and shaken <==
     than I had ever seen him.

     "That hurts my pride, Watson," he said at last. "It is a petty
     feeling, no doubt, but it hurts my pride. It becomes a personal
     matter with me now, and, if God sends me health, I shall set my hand

     "No; I shall be my own police. When I have spun the web they may take
     the flies, but not before."

     All day I was engaged in my professional work, and it was late in the
==>      evening before I returned to Baker Street. Sherlock Holmes had not <==
     come back yet. It was nearly ten o'clock before he entered, looking
     pale and worn. He walked up to the sideboard, and tearing a piece
     from the loaf he devoured it voraciously, washing it down with a long
     draught of water.
