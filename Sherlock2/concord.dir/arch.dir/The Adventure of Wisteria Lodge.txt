     I find it recorded in my notebook that it was a bleak and windy day
==>      towards the end of March in the year 1892.  Holmes had received a <==
     telegram while we sat at our lunch, and he had scribbled a reply.  He
     made no remark, but the matter remained in his thoughts, for he stood
     in front of the fire afterwards with a thoughtful face, smoking his
     pipe, and casting an occasional glance at the message. Suddenly he
     turned upon me with a mischievous twinkle in his eyes.

     orthodox and conventional to the last degree. But some amazing
     experience had disturbed his native composure and left its traces in
     his bristling hair, his flushed, angry cheeks, and his flurried,
     excited manner. He plunged instantly into his business.

==>      "I have had a most singular and unpleasant experience, Mr. Holmes," <==
     said he. "Never in my life have I been placed in such a situation. It
     is most improper--most outrageous. I must insist upon some
     explanation." He swelled and puffed in his anger.

     "Pray sit down, Mr. Scott Eccles," said Holmes in a soothing voice.

     said he. "Never in my life have I been placed in such a situation. It
     is most improper--most outrageous. I must insist upon some
     explanation." He swelled and puffed in his anger.

==>      "Pray sit down, Mr. Scott Eccles," said Holmes in a soothing voice. <==
     "May I ask, in the first place, why you came to me at all?"

     "Well, sir, it did not appear to be a matter which concerned the
     police, and yet, when you have heard the facts, you must admit that I
     could not leave it where it was. Private detectives are a class with

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 58157    window = 58152 58162



     "Quite so.  But, in the second place, why did you not come at once?"

     "What do you mean?"

==>      Holmes glanced at his watch. <==

     "It is a quarter-past two," he said. "Your telegram was dispatched
     about one. But no one can glance at your toilet and attire without
     seeing that your disturbance dates from the moment of your waking."


[line number in individual story] matching line = 89    window = 84 94

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 58166    window = 58161 58171


     seeing that your disturbance dates from the moment of your waking."

     Our client smoothed down his unbrushed hair and felt his unshaven
     chin.

==>      "You are right, Mr. Holmes. I never gave a thought to my toilet. I <==
     was only too glad to get out of such a house. But I have been running
     round making inquiries before I came to you. I went to the house
     agents, you know, and they said that Mr. Garcia's rent was paid up
     all right and that everything was in order at Wisteria Lodge."

     all right and that everything was in order at Wisteria Lodge."

==>      "Come, come, sir," said Holmes, laughing. "You are like my friend, <==
     Dr. Watson, who has a bad habit of telling his stories wrong end
     foremost. Please arrange your thoughts and let me know, in their due
     sequence, exactly what those events are which have sent you out
     unbrushed and unkempt, with dress boots and waistcoat buttoned awry,
     in search of advice and assistance."

     in search of advice and assistance."

     Our client looked down with a rueful face at his own unconventional
     appearance.

==>      "I'm sure it must look very bad, Mr. Holmes, and I am not aware that <==
     in my whole life such a thing has ever happened before. But will tell
     you the whole queer business, and when I have done so you will admit,
     I am sure, that there has been enough to excuse me."

     But his narrative was nipped in the bud. There was a bustle outside,

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 58191    window = 58186 58196



     But his narrative was nipped in the bud. There was a bustle outside,
     and Mrs. Hudson opened the door to usher in two robust and
     official-looking individuals, one of whom was well known to us as
     Inspector Gregson of Scotland Yard, an energetic, gallant, and,
==>      within his limitations, a capable officer. He shook hands with Holmes <==
     and introduced his comrade as Inspector Baynes, of the Surrey
     Constabulary.

     "We are hunting together, Mr. Holmes, and our trail lay in this
     direction." He turned his bulldog eyes upon our visitor. "Are you Mr.

     and introduced his comrade as Inspector Baynes, of the Surrey

     John Scott Eccles, of Popham House, Lee?"

     "I am."

     "I am."

     "We have been following you about all the morning."

==>      "You traced him through the telegram, no doubt," said Holmes.  <==

     "Exactly, Mr. Holmes. We picked up the scent at Charing Cross
     Post-Office and came on here."

     "But why do you follow me? What do you want?"

     "Oh, you did, did you?"

     Out came the official notebook.

==>      "Wait a bit, Gregson," said Sherlock Holmes. "All you desire is a <==
     plain statement, is it not?"

     "And it is my duty to warn Mr. Scott Eccles that it may be used
     against him."


[line number in individual story] matching line = 250    window = 245 255

     empty, and the bed had never been slept in. He had gone with the
     rest. The foreign host, the foreign footman, the foreign cook, all
     had vanished in the night! That was the end of my visit to Wisteria
     Lodge."

==>      Sherlock Holmes was rubbing his hands and chuckling as he added this <==
     bizarre incident to his collection of strange episodes.

     "Your experience is, so far as I know, perfectly unique," said he.
     "May I ask, sir, what you did then?"


[line number in individual story] matching line = 294    window = 289 299

     only redeemed from grossness by two extraordinarily bright eyes,
     almost hidden behind the heavy creases of cheek and brow. With a slow
     smile he drew a folded and discoloured scrap of paper from his
     pocket.

==>      "It was a dog-grate, Mr. Holmes, and he overpitched it. I picked this <==
     out unburned from the back of it."

     Holmes smiled his appreciation.

     "You must have examined the house very carefully to find a single

     pocket.

     out unburned from the back of it."

==>      Holmes smiled his appreciation. <==

     "You must have examined the house very carefully to find a single
     pellet of paper."

     "I did, Mr. Holmes. It's my way. Shall I read it, Mr. Gregson?"

     The Londoner nodded.

     "The note is written upon ordinary cream-laid paper without
     watermark. It is a quarter-sheet. The paper is cut off in two snips

     "It is a woman's writing, done with a sharp-pointed pen, but the
     address is either done with another pen or by someone else. It is
     thicker and bolder, as you see."

==>      "A very remarkable note," said Holmes, glancing it over. "I must <==
     compliment you, Mr. Baynes, upon your attention to detail in your
     examination of it. A few trifling points might perhaps be added. The
     oval seal is undoubtedly a plain sleeve-link--what else is of such a
     shape? The scissors were bent nail scissors. Short as the two snips
     are, you can distinctly see the same slight curve in each."

     "I think now," said Gregson, rising, "we had best put this matter
     into an official shape. You will come round with us to the station,
     Mr. Scott Eccles, and let us have your statement in writing."

     "Certainly, I will come at once. But I retain your services, Mr.
==>      Holmes. I desire you to spare no expense and no pains to get at the <==
     truth."

     My friend turned to the country inspector.

     "I suppose that you have no objection to my collaborating with you,

     "But that is perfectly impossible, Mr. Baynes," cried our client.
     "His voice is unmistakable. I could swear to it that it was he who
     addressed me in my bedroom at that very hour."

==>      "Remarkable, but by no means impossible," said Holmes, smiling. <==

     "You have a clue?" asked Gregson.

     "On the face of it the case is not a very complex one, though it
     certainly presents some novel and interesting features. A further

     "There were," said he, "one or two very remarkable things. Perhaps
     when I have finished at the police-station you would care to come out
     and give me your opinion of them."

==>      "In am entirely at your service," said Sherlock Holmes, ringing the <==
     bell. "You will show these gentlemen out, Mrs. Hudson, and kindly
     send the boy with this telegram. He is to pay a five-shilling reply."

     We sat for some time in silence after our visitors had left. Holmes
     smoked hard, with his browns drawn down over his keen eyes, and his

==>      We sat for some time in silence after our visitors had left. Holmes <==
     smoked hard, with his browns drawn down over his keen eyes, and his
     head thrust forward in the eager way characteristic of the man.

     "Well, Watson," he asked, turning suddenly upon me, "what do you make
     of it?"

[line number in individual story] matching line = 452    window = 447 457

     themselves into the scheme, then our hypothesis may gradually become
     a solution."

     "But what is our hypothesis?"

==>      Holmes leaned back in his chair with half-closed eyes. <==

     "You must admit, my dear Watson, that the idea of a joke is
     impossible. There were grave events afoot, as the sequel showed, and
     the coaxing of Scott Eccles to Wisteria Lodge had some connection
     with them."

     English. Well, we can only possess our soul in patience until this
     excellent inspector come back for us. Meanwhile we can thank our
     lucky fate which has rescued us for a few short hours from the
     insufferable fatigues of idleness."

==>      An answer had arrived to Holmes's telegram before our Surrey officer <==
     had returned. Holmes read it and was about to place it in his
     notebook when he caught a glimpse of my expectant face. He tossed it
     across with a laugh.

     "We are moving in exalted circles," said he.

     Hynes Hynes, J.P., Purdley Place; Mr. James Baker Williams, Forton
     Old Hall; Mr. Henderson, High Gable; Rev. Joshua Stone, Nether
     Walsling.
     "This is a very obvious way of limiting our field of operations,"
==>      said Holmes. "No doubt Baynes, with his methodical mind, has already <==
     adopted some similar plan."

     "I don't quite understand."

     "Well, my dear fellow, we have already arrived at the conclusion that

     skein must lie among them."

     It was nearly six o'clock before we found ourselves in the pretty
     Surrey village of Esher, with Inspector Baynes as our companion.

==>      Holmes and I had taken things for the night, and found comfortable <==
     quarters at the Bull. Finally we set out in the company of the
     detective on our visit to Wisteria Lodge. It was a cold, dark March
     evening, with a sharp wind and a fine rain beating upon our faces, a
     fit setting for the wild common over which our road passed and the
     tragic goal to which it led us.

[line number in individual story] matching line = 632    window = 627 637

     mark against you for this. If it were the devil himself a constable
     on duty should never thank God that he could not lay his hands upon
     him. I suppose the whole thing is not a vision and a touch of
     nerves?"

==>      "That, at least, is very easily settled," said Holmes, lighting his <==
     little pocket lantern. "Yes," he reported, after a short examination
     of the grass bed, "a number twelve shoe, I should say. If he was all
     on the same scale as his foot he must certainly have been a giant."

     "What became of him?"

[line number in individual story] matching line = 645    window = 640 650

     road."

     "Well," said the inspector with a grave and thoughtful face, "whoever
     he may have been, and whatever he may have wanted, he's gone for the
     present, and we have more immediate things to attend to. Now, Mr.
==>      Holmes, with your permission, I will show you round the house." <==

     The various bedrooms and sitting-rooms had yielded nothing to a
     careful search. Apparently the tenants had brought little or nothing
     with them, and all the furniture down to the smallest details had
     been taken over with the house. A good deal of clothing with the

[line number in individual story] matching line = 659    window = 654 664

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 58736    window = 58731 58741


     ends, some pipes, a few novels, two of them in Spanish, and
     old-fashioned pinfire revolver, and a guitar were among the personal
     property.

     "Nothing in all this," said Baynes, stalking, candle in hand, from
==>      room to room. "But now, Mr. Holmes, I invite your attention to the <==
     kitchen."

     It was a gloomy, high-ceilinged room at the back of the house, with a
     straw litter in one corner, which served apparently as a bed for the
     cook. The table was piled with half-eaten dishes and dirty plates,

[line number in individual story] matching line = 679    window = 674 684

     that it was a mummified negro baby, and then it seemed a very twisted
     and ancient monkey. Finally I was left in doubt as to whether it was
     animal or human. A double band of white shells were strung round the
     centre of it.

==>      "Very interesting--very interesting, indeed!" said Holmes, peering at <==
     this sinister relic. "Anything more?"

     In silence Baynes led the way to the sink and held forward his
     candle. The limbs and body of some large, white bird, torn savagely
     to pieces with the feathers still on, were littered all over it.

     this sinister relic. "Anything more?"

     In silence Baynes led the way to the sink and held forward his
     candle. The limbs and body of some large, white bird, torn savagely
     to pieces with the feathers still on, were littered all over it.
==>      Holmes pointed to the wattles on the severed head. <==

     "A white cock," said he. "Most interesting! It is really a very
     curious case."

     But Mr. Baynes had kept his most sinister exhibit to the last. From

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 58776    window = 58771 58781



     "Something has been killed and something has been burned. We raked
     all these out of the fire. We had a doctor in this morning. He says
     that they are not human."

==>      Holmes smiled and rubbed his hands. <==

     "I must congratulate you, Inspector, on handling so distinctive and
     instructive a case. Your powers, if I may say so without offence,
     seem superior to your opportunities."

     instructive a case. Your powers, if I may say so without offence,
     seem superior to your opportunities."

     Inspector Baynes's small eyes twinkled with pleasure.

==>      "You're right, Mr. Holmes. We stagnate in the provinces. A case of <==
     this sort gives a man a chance, and I hope that I shall take it. What
     do you make of these bones?"

     "A lamb, I should say, or a kid."

     for every port is watched. But my own views are different. Yes, sir,
     my own views are very different."

     "You have a theory then?"

==>      "And I'll work it myself, Mr. Holmes. It's only due to my own credit <==
     to do so. Your name is made, but I have still to make mine. I should
     be glad to be able to say afterwards that I had solved it without
     your help."

     Holmes laughed good-humoredly.

[line number in individual story] matching line = 730    window = 725 735

     your help."

==>      Holmes laughed good-humoredly. <==

     "Well, well, Inspector," said he. "Do you follow your path and I will
     follow mine. My results are always very much at your service if you
     care to apply to me for them. I think that I have seen all that I
     wish in this house, and that my time may be more profitably employed

     care to apply to me for them. I think that I have seen all that I

     elsewhere. Au revoir and good luck!"

     I could tell by numerous subtle signs, which might have been lost
==>      upon anyone but myself, that Holmes was on a hot scent. As impassive <==
     as ever to the casual observer, there were none the less a subdued
     eagerness and suggestion of tension in his brightened eyes and
     brisker manner which assured me that the game was afoot. After his
     habit he said nothing, and after mine I asked no questions.

==>      Holmes sprang in his chair as if he had been stung when I read the <==
     headlines.

     "By Jove!" he cried. "You don't mean that Baynes has got him?"

     "Apparently," said I as I read the following report:

     night after a struggle in which Constable Downing was badly bitten by
     the savage. We understand that when the prison is brought before the
     magistrates a remand will be applied for by the police, and that
     great developments are hoped from his capture."

==>      "Really we must see Baynes at once," cried Holmes, picking up his <==
     hat. "We will just catch him before he starts." We hurried down the
     village street and found, as we had expected, that the inspector was
     just leaving his lodgings.

     "You've seen the paper, Mr. Holmes?" he asked, holding one out to us.

     "Yes, Baynes, I've seen it. Pray don't think it a liberty if I give

     "Of warning, Mr. Holmes?"

     Holmes shrugged his shoulders as we walked away together. "I can't

     touch with the situation, as I may need your help to-night. Let me
     show you the evolution of this case so far as I have been able to
     follow it. Simple as it has been in its leading features, it has none
     the less presented surprising difficulties in the way of an arrest.

     It was not, I must confess, a very alluring prospect. The old house
     with its atmosphere of murder, the singular and formidable
     inhabitants, the unknown dangers of the approach, and the fact that
     we were putting ourselves legally in a false position all combined to
     damp my ardour. But there was something in the ice-cold reasoning of
==>      Holmes which made it impossible to shrink from any adventure which he <==
     might recommend. One knew that thus, and only thus, could a solution
     be found. I clasped his hand in silence, and the die was cast.

     But it was not destined that our investigation should have so
     adventurous an ending. It was about five o'clock, and the shadows of

     But it was not destined that our investigation should have so
     adventurous an ending. It was about five o'clock, and the shadows of
     the March evening were beginning to fall, when an excited rustic
     rushed into our room.

==>      "They've gone, Mr. Holmes. They went by the last train. The lady <==
     broke away, and I've got her in a cab downstairs."

     "Excellent, Warner!" cried Holmes, springing to his feet. "Watson,
     the gaps are closing rapidly."

     the gaps are closing rapidly."

     In the cab was a woman, half-collapsed from nervous exhaustion. She
     bore upon her aquiline and emaciated face the traces of some recent
     tragedy. Her head hung listlessly upon her breast, but as she raised

     tragedy. Her head hung listlessly upon her breast, but as she raised
     it and turned her dull eyes upon us I saw that her pupils were dark
     dots in the centre of the broad gray iris. She was drugged with
     opium.

==>      "I watched at the gate, same as you advised, Mr. Holmes," said our <==
     emissary, the discharged gardener. "When the carriage came out I
     followed it to the station. She was like one walking in her sleep,
     but when they tried to get her into the train she came to life and
     struggled. They pushed her into the carriage. She fought her way out
     again. I took her part, got her into a cab, and here we are. I shan't

     short life if he had his way--the black-eyed, scowling, yellow
     devil."

     We carried her upstairs, laid her on the sofa, and a couple of cups
     of the strongest coffee soon cleared her brain from the mists of the
==>      drug. Baynes had been summoned by Holmes, and the situation rapidly <==
     explained to him.

     "Why, sir, you've got me the very evidence I want," said the
     inspector warmly, shaking my friend by the hand. "I was on the same
     scent as you from the first."

     inspector warmly, shaking my friend by the hand. "I was on the same
     scent as you from the first."

     "What! You were after Henderson?"

==>      "Why, Mr. Holmes, when you were crawling in the shrubbery at High <==
     Gable I was up one of the trees in the plantation and saw you down
     below. It was just who would get his evidence first."

     "Then why did you arrest the mulatto?"

     suspected, and that he would lie low and make no move so long as he
     thought he was in any danger. I arrested the wrong man to make him
     believe that our eyes were off him. I knew he would be likely to
     clear off then and give us a chance of getting at Miss Burnet."

==>      Holmes laid his hand upon the inspector's shoulder. <==

     "You will rise high in your profession. You have instinct and
     intuition," said he.

     Baynes flushed with pleasure.

[line number in individual story] matching line = 1086    window = 1081 1091

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 59163    window = 59158 59168


     must have been hard put to it when Miss Burnet broke away. However,
     your man picked her up, and it all ends well. We can't arrest without
     her evidence, that is clear, so the sooner we get a statement the
     better."

==>      "Every minute she gets stronger," said Holmes, glancing at the <==
     governess. "But tell me, Baynes, who is this man Henderson?"

     "Henderson," the inspector answered, "is Don Murillo, once called the
     Tiger of San Pedro."

     From that moment he had vanished from the world, and his identity had
     been a frequent subject for comment in the European press.

     "Yes, sir, Don Murillo, the Tiger of San Pedro," said Baynes. "If you
     look it up you will find that the San Pedro colours are green and
==>      white, same as in the note, Mr. Holmes. Henderson he called himself, <==
     but I traced him back, Paris and Rome and Madrid to Barcelona, where
     his ship came in in '86. They've been looking for him all the time
     for their revenge, but it is only now that they have begun to find
     him out."

     monster goes safe. But another will come, and yet another, until some
     day justice will be done; that is as certain as the rise of
     to-morrow's sun." Her thin hands clenched, and her worn face blanched
     with the passion of her hatred.

==>      "But how come you into this matter, Miss Burnet?" asked Holmes. "How <==
     can an English lady join in such a murderous affair?"

     "I join in it because there is no other way in the world by which
     justice can be gained. What does the law of England care for the
     rivers of blood shed years ago in San Pedro, or for the shipload of

     committed in some other planet. But we know. We have learned the
     truth in sorrow and in suffering. To us there is no fiend in hell
     like Juan Murillo, and no peace in life while his victims still cry
     for vengeance."

==>      "No doubt," said Holmes, "he was as you say. I have heard that he was <==
     atrocious. But how are you affected?"

     "I will tell you it all. This villain's policy was to murder, on one
     pretext or another, every man who showed such promise that he might
     in time come to be a dangerous rival. My husband--yes, my real name

     hands. I sprang out, they tried to drag me back, and had it not been
     for the help of this good man, who led me to the cab, I should never
     had broken away. Now, thank God, I am beyond their power forever."

     We had all listened intently to this remarkable statement. It was
==>      Holmes who broke the silence. <==

     "Our difficulties are not over," he remarked, shaking his head. "Our
     police work ends, but our legal work begins."

     "Exactly," said I. "A plausible lawyer could make it out as an act of

     Baker Street with a printed description of the dark face of the
     secretary, and of the masterful features, the magnetic black eyes,
     and the tufted brows of his master. We could not doubt that justice,
     if belated, had come at last.

==>      "A chaotic case, my dear Watson," said Holmes over an evening pipe. <==
     "It will not be possible for you to present in that compact form
     which is dear to your heart. It covers two continents, concerns two
     groups of mysterious persons, and is further complicated by the
     highly respectable presence of our friend, Scott Eccles, whose
     inclusion shows me that the deceased Garcia had a scheming mind and a

     a trap into which the creature walked. Any other point, Watson?"

     "The torn bird, the pail of blood, the charred bones, all the mystery
     of that weird kitchen?"

==>      Holmes smiled as he turned up an entry in his note-book. <==

     "I spent a morning in the British Museum reading up on that and other
     points. Here is a quotation from Eckermann's Voodooism and the
     Negroid Religions:

     followed by cannibalism. The more usual victims are a white cock,
     which is plucked in pieces alive, or a black goat, whose throat is
     cut and body burned.'

     "So you see our savage friend was very orthodox in his ritual. It is
==>      grotesque, Watson," Holmes added, as he slowly fastened his notebook, <==
     "but, as I have had occasion to remark, there is but one step from
     the grotesque to the horrible."

     made no remark, but the matter remained in his thoughts, for he stood
     in front of the fire afterwards with a thoughtful face, smoking his

     he. "How do you define the word 'grotesque'?"

     foremost. Please arrange your thoughts and let me know, in their due
     sequence, exactly what those events are which have sent you out
     unbrushed and unkempt, with dress boots and waistcoat buttoned awry,
     in search of advice and assistance."

     "And it is my duty to warn Mr. Scott Eccles that it may be used
     against him."

     "Mr. Eccles was going to tell us about it when you entered the room.
==>      I think, Watson, a brandy and soda would do him no harm. Now, sir, I <==
     suggest that you take no notice of this addition to your audience,
     and that you proceed with your narrative exactly as you would have
     done had you never been interrupted."

     Our visitor had gulped off the brandy and the colour had returned to

     We sat for some time in silence after our visitors had left. Holmes
     smoked hard, with his browns drawn down over his keen eyes, and his
     head thrust forward in the eager way characteristic of the man.

==>      "Well, Watson," he asked, turning suddenly upon me, "what do you make <==
     of it?"

     "I can make nothing of this mystification of Scott Eccles."

     "But the crime?"

     "Then why did they fly?"

     "Quite so. Why did they fly? There is a big fact. Another big fact is
     the remarkable experience of our client, Scott Eccles. Now, my dear
==>      Watson, is it beyond the limits of human ingenuity to furnish an <==
     explanation which would cover both of these big facts? If it were one
     which would also admit of the mysterious note with its very curious
     phraseology, why, then it would be worth accepting as a temporary
     hypothesis. If the fresh facts which come to our knowledge all fit
     themselves into the scheme, then our hypothesis may gradually become

     "But what is our hypothesis?"

     Holmes leaned back in his chair with half-closed eyes.

==>      "You must admit, my dear Watson, that the idea of a joke is <==
     impossible. There were grave events afoot, as the sequel showed, and
     the coaxing of Scott Eccles to Wisteria Lodge had some connection
     with them."

     "But what possible connection?"

     "Nothing, as things turned out, but everything had they gone another
     way. That is how I read the matter."

     "I see, he might have proved an alibi."

==>      "Exactly, my dear Watson; he might have proved an alibi. We will <==
     suppose, for argument's sake, that the household of Wisteria Lodge
     are confederates in some design. The attempt, whatever it may be, is
     to come off, we will say, before one o'clock. By some juggling of the
     clocks it is quite possible that they may have got Scott Eccles to
     bed earlier than he thought, but in any case it is likely that when

     had it not been so. 'D'--that should be a guide."

     "The man was a Spaniard. I suggest that 'D' stands for Dolores, a
     common female name in Spain."

==>      "Good, Watson, very good--but quite inadmissable. A Spaniard would <==
     write to a Spaniard in Spanish. The writer of this note is certainly
     English. Well, we can only possess our soul in patience until this
     excellent inspector come back for us. Meanwhile we can thank our
     lucky fate which has rescued us for a few short hours from the
     insufferable fatigues of idleness."

     morning he spent in town, and I learned from a casual reference that
     he had visited the British Museum. Save for this one excursion, he
     spent his days in long and often solitary walks, or in chatting with
     a number of village gossips whose acquaintance he had cultivated.

==>      "I'm sure, Watson, a week in the country will be invaluable to you," <==
     he remarked. "It is very pleasant to see the first green shoots upon
     the hedges and the catkins on the hazels once again. With a spud, a
     tin box, and an elementary book on botany, there are instructive days
     to be spent." He prowled about with this equipment himself, but it
     was a poor show of plants which he would bring back of an evening.

     Holmes shrugged his shoulders as we walked away together. "I can't
     make the man out. He seems to be riding for a fall. Well, as he says,
     we must each try our own way and see what comes of it. But there's
     something in Inspector Baynes which I can't quite understand."

==>      "Just sit down in that chair, Watson," said Sherlock Holmes when we <==
     had returned to our apartment at the Bull. "I want to put you in
     touch with the situation, as I may need your help to-night. Let me
     show you the evolution of this case so far as I have been able to
     follow it. Simple as it has been in its leading features, it has none
     the less presented surprising difficulties in the way of an arrest.

     people who live far aloof from romance. But Mr. Henderson, of High
     Gable, was by all accounts a curious man to whom curious adventures
     might befall. I concentrated my attention, therefore, upon him and
     his household.

==>      "A singular set of people, Watson--the man himself the most singular <==
     of them all. I managed to see him on a plausible pretext, but I
     seemed to read in his dark, deepset, brooding eyes that he was
     perfectly aware of my true business. He is a man of fifty, strong,
     active, with iron-gray hair, great bunched black eyebrows, the step
     of a deer and the air of an emperor--a fierce, masterful man, with a

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 59004    window = 58999 59009


     of a deer and the air of an emperor--a fierce, masterful man, with a
     red-hot spirit behind his parchment face. He is either a foreigner or
     has lived long in the tropics, for he is yellow and sapless, but
     tough as whipcord. His friend and secretary, Mr. Lucas, is
     undoubtedly a foreigner, chocolate brown, wily, suave, and catlike,
==>      with a poisonous gentleness of speech. You see, Watson, we have come <==
     already upon two sets of foreigners--one at Wisteria Lodge and one at
     High Gable--so our gaps are beginning to close.

     "These two men, close and confidential friends, are the centre of the
     household; but there is one other person who for our immediate

     enabled me to find John Warner, late gardener of High Gable, sacked
     in a moment of temper by his imperious employer. He in turn had
     friends among the indoor servants who unite in their fear and dislike
     of their master. So I had my key to the secrets of the establishment.

==>      "Curious people, Watson! I don't pretend to understand it all yet, <==
     but very curious people anyway. It's a double-winged house, and the
     servants live on one side, the family on the other. There's no link
     between the two save for Henderson's own servant, who serves the
     family's meals. Everything is carried to a certain door, which forms
     the one connection. Governess and children hardly go out at all,

     creditor to come up and claim his own.' Where they came from, or who
     they are, nobody has an idea. They are very violent. Twice Henderson
     has lashed at folk with his dog-whip, and only his long purse and
     heavy compensation have kept him out of the courts.

==>      "Well, now, Watson, let us judge the situation by this new <==
     information. We may take it that the letter came out of this strange
     household and was an invitation to Garcia to carry out some attempt
     which had already been planned. Who wrote the note? It was someone
     within the citadel, and it was a woman. Who then but Miss Burnet, the
     governess? All our reasoning seems to point that way. At any rate, we

     of the murder. From that evening she has utterly vanished. Is she
     alive? Has she perhaps met her end on the same night as the friend
     whom she had summoned? Or is she merely a prisoner? There is the
     point which we still have to decide.

==>      "You will appreciate the difficulty of the situation, Watson. There <==
     is nothing upon which we can apply for a warrant. Our whole scheme
     might seem fantastic if laid before a magistrate. The woman's
     disappearance counts for nothing, since in that extraordinary
     household any member of it might be invisible for a week. And yet she
     may at the present moment be in danger of her life. All I can do is

     rushed into our room.

     "They've gone, Mr. Holmes. They went by the last train. The lady
     broke away, and I've got her in a cab downstairs."

==>      "Excellent, Warner!" cried Holmes, springing to his feet. "Watson, <==
     the gaps are closing rapidly."

     In the cab was a woman, half-collapsed from nervous exhaustion. She
     bore upon her aquiline and emaciated face the traces of some recent
     tragedy. Her head hung listlessly upon her breast, but as she raised

     Baker Street with a printed description of the dark face of the
     secretary, and of the masterful features, the magnetic black eyes,
     and the tufted brows of his master. We could not doubt that justice,
     if belated, had come at last.

==>      "A chaotic case, my dear Watson," said Holmes over an evening pipe. <==
     "It will not be possible for you to present in that compact form
     which is dear to your heart. It covers two continents, concerns two
     groups of mysterious persons, and is further complicated by the
     highly respectable presence of our friend, Scott Eccles, whose
     inclusion shows me that the deceased Garcia had a scheming mind and a

     back to it next day, when, on reconnoitering through the window, he
     found policeman Walters in possession. He waited three days longer,
     and then his piety or his superstition drove him to try once more.
     Inspector Baynes, who, with his usual astuteness, had minimized the
     incident before me, had really recognized its importance and had left

     "The torn bird, the pail of blood, the charred bones, all the mystery
     of that weird kitchen?"

     Holmes smiled as he turned up an entry in his note-book.

     followed by cannibalism. The more usual victims are a white cock,
     which is plucked in pieces alive, or a black goat, whose throat is
     cut and body burned.'

     "So you see our savage friend was very orthodox in his ritual. It is

     "but, as I have had occasion to remark, there is but one step from
     the grotesque to the horrible."
