     It was a blazing hot day in August. Baker Street was like an oven,
     and the glare of the sunlight upon the yellow brickwork of the house
     across the road was painful to the eye. It was hard to believe that
     these were the same walls which loomed so gloomily through the fogs
==>      of winter. Our blinds were half-drawn, and Holmes lay curled upon the <==
     sofa, reading and re-reading a letter which he had received by the
     morning post. For myself, my term of service in India had trained me
     to stand heat better than cold, and a thermometer at ninety was no
     hardship. But the morning paper was uninteresting. Parliament had
     risen. Everybody was out of town, and I yearned for the glades of the

[line number in individual story] matching line = 22    window = 17 27

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 59396    window = 59391 59401


     every little rumour or suspicion of unsolved crime. Appreciation of
     nature found no place among his many gifts, and his only change was
     when he turned his mind from the evil-doer of the town to track down
     his brother of the country.

==>      Finding that Holmes was too absorbed for conversation I had tossed <==
     side the barren paper, and leaning back in my chair I fell into a
     brown study. Suddenly my companion's voice broke in upon my thoughts:

     "You are right, Watson," said he. "It does seem a most preposterous
     way of settling a dispute."

[line number in individual story] matching line = 33    window = 28 38

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 59407    window = 59402 59412



     "Most preposterous!" I exclaimed, and then suddenly realizing how he
     had echoed the inmost thought of my soul, I sat up in my chair and
     stared at him in blank amazement.

==>      "What is this, Holmes?" I cried. "This is beyond anything which I <==
     could have imagined."

     He laughed heartily at my perplexity.

     "You remember," said he, "that some little time ago when I read you

     the north of Ireland, and, to the best of Miss Cushing's belief, from
     Belfast. In the meantime, the matter is being actively investigated,
     Mr. Lestrade, one of the very smartest of our detective officers,
     being in charge of the case."

==>      "So much for the Daily Chronicle," said Holmes as I finished reading. <==
     "Now for our friend Lestrade. I had a note from him this morning, in
     which he says:

     "I think that this case is very much in your line. We have every hope
     of clearing the matter up, but we find a little difficulty in getting

     "You shall have it then. Ring for our boots and tell them to order a
     cab. I'll be back in a moment when I have changed my dressing-gown
     and filled my cigar-case."

     A shower of rain fell while we were in the train, and the heat was
==>      far less oppressive in Croydon than in town. Holmes had sent on a <==
     wire, so that Lestrade, as wiry, as dapper, and as ferret-like as
     ever, was waiting for us at the station. A walk of five minutes took
     us to Cross Street, where Miss Cushing resided.

     It was a very long street of two-story brick houses, neat and prim,

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 59571    window = 59566 59576



     "They are in the outhouse, those dreadful things," said she as
     Lestrade entered. "I wish that you would take them away altogether."

     "So I shall, Miss Cushing. I only kept them here until my friend, Mr.
==>      Holmes, should have seen them in your presence." <==

     "Why in my presence, sir?"

     "In case he wished to ask any questions."


[line number in individual story] matching line = 206    window = 201 211

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 59580    window = 59575 59585


     "In case he wished to ask any questions."

     "What is the use of asking me questions when I tell you I know
     nothing whatever about it?"

==>      "Quite so, madam," said Holmes in his soothing way. "I have no doubt <==
     that you have been annoyed more than enough already over this
     business."

     "Indeed I have, sir. I am a quiet woman and live a retired life. It
     is something new for me to see my name in the papers and to find the

     that this knot is of a peculiar character."

     "It is very neatly tied. I had already made a note of that effect,"
     said Lestrade complacently.

==>      "So much for the string, then," said Holmes, smiling, "now for the <==
     box wrapper. Brown paper, with a distinct smell of coffee. What, did
     you not observe it? I think there can be no doubt of it. Address
     printed in rather straggling characters: 'Miss S. Cushing, Cross
     Street, Croydon.' Done with a broad-pointed pen, probably a J, and
     with very inferior ink. The word 'Croydon' has been originally

     day during that time. Why on earth, then, should any criminal send
     her the proofs of his guilt, especially as, unless she is a most
     consummate actress, she understands quite as little of the matter as
     we do?"

==>      "That is the problem which we have to solve," Holmes answered, "and <==
     for my part I shall set about it by presuming that my reasoning is
     correct, and that a double murder has been committed. One of these
     ears is a woman's, small, finely formed, and pierced for an earring.
     The other is a man's, sun-burned, discoloured, and also pierced for
     an earring. These two people are presumably dead, or we should have

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 59698    window = 59693 59703



     "In that case I may leave you here," said Lestrade, "for I have
     another small business on hand. I think that I have nothing further
     to learn from Miss Cushing. You will find me at the police-station."

==>      "We shall look in on our way to the train," answered Holmes. A moment <==
     later he and I were back in the front room, where the impassive lady
     was still quietly working away at her antimacassar. She put it down
     on her lap as we entered and looked at us with her frank, searching
     blue eyes.


[line number in individual story] matching line = 336    window = 331 341

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 59710    window = 59705 59715


     that the parcel was never meant for me at all. I have said this
     several times to the gentlemen from Scotland Yard, but he simply
     laughs at me. I have not an enemy in the world, as far as I know, so
     why should anyone play me such a trick?"

==>      "I am coming to be of the same opinion, Miss Cushing," said Holmes, <==
     taking a seat beside her. "I think that it is more than probable--"
     He paused, and I was surprised, on glancing round to see that he was
     staring with singular intentness at the lady's profile. Surprise and
     satisfaction were both for an instant to be read upon his eager face,
     though when she glanced round to find out the cause of his silence he

[line number in individual story] matching line = 392    window = 387 397

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 59766    window = 59761 59771


     felt very deeply. Like most people who lead a lonely life, she was
     shy at first, but ended by becoming extremely communicative. She told
     us many details about her brother-in-law the steward, and then
     wandering off on the subject of her former lodgers, the medical
     students, she gave us a long account of their delinquencies, with
==>      their names and those of their hospitals. Holmes listened attentively <==
     to everything, throwing in a question from time to time.

     "About your second sister, Sarah," said he. "I wonder, since you are
     both maiden ladies, that you do not keep house together."


[line number in individual story] matching line = 413    window = 408 418

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 59787    window = 59782 59792


     enough for Jim Browner. The last six months that she was here she
     would speak of nothing but his drinking and his ways. He had caught
     her meddling, I suspect, and given her a bit of his mind, and that
     was the start of it."

==>      "Thank you, Miss Cushing," said Holmes, rising and bowing. "Your <==
     sister Sarah lives, I think you said, at New Street, Wallington?
     Good-bye, and I am very sorry that you should have been troubled over
     a case with which, as you say, you have nothing whatever to do."

     There was a cab passing as we came out, and Holmes hailed it.

[line number in individual story] matching line = 418    window = 413 423

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 59792    window = 59787 59797


     "Thank you, Miss Cushing," said Holmes, rising and bowing. "Your
     sister Sarah lives, I think you said, at New Street, Wallington?
     Good-bye, and I am very sorry that you should have been troubled over
     a case with which, as you say, you have nothing whatever to do."

==>      There was a cab passing as we came out, and Holmes hailed it. <==

     "How far to Wallington?" he asked.

     "Only about a mile, sir."

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 59803    window = 59798 59808


     "Very good. Jump in, Watson. We must strike while the iron is hot.
     Simple as the case is, there have been one or two very instructive
     details in connection with it. Just pull up at a telegraph office as
     you pass, cabby."

==>      Holmes sent off a short wire and for the rest of the drive lay back <==
     in the cab, with his hat tilted over his nose to keep the sun from
     his face. Our drive pulled up at a house which was not unlike the one
     which we had just quitted. My companion ordered him to wait, and had
     his hand upon the knocker, when the door opened and a grave young
     gentleman in black, with a very shiny hat, appeared on the step.

[line number in individual story] matching line = 436    window = 431 441

     his face. Our drive pulled up at a house which was not unlike the one
     which we had just quitted. My companion ordered him to wait, and had
     his hand upon the knocker, when the door opened and a grave young
     gentleman in black, with a very shiny hat, appeared on the step.

==>      "Is Miss Cushing at home?" asked Holmes. <==

     "Miss Sarah Cushing is extremely ill," said he. "She has been
     suffering since yesterday from brain symptoms of great severity. As
     her medical adviser, I cannot possibly take the responsibility of
     allowing anyone to see her. I should recommend you to call again in

[line number in individual story] matching line = 445    window = 440 450

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 59819    window = 59814 59824


     her medical adviser, I cannot possibly take the responsibility of
     allowing anyone to see her. I should recommend you to call again in
     ten days." He drew on his gloves, closed the door, and marched off
     down the street.

==>      "Well, if we can't we can't," said Holmes, cheerfully. <==

     "Perhaps she could not or would not have told you much."

     "I did not wish her to tell me anything. I only wanted to look at
     her. However, I think that I have got all that I want. Drive us to

[line number in individual story] matching line = 455    window = 450 460

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 59829    window = 59824 59834


     her. However, I think that I have got all that I want. Drive us to
     some decent hotel, cabby, where we may have some lunch, and
     afterwards we shall drop down upon friend Lestrade at the
     police-station."

==>      We had a pleasant little meal together, during which Holmes would <==
     talk about nothing but violins, narrating with great exultation how
     he had purchased his own Stradivarius, which was worth at least five
     hundred guineas, at a Jew broker's in Tottenham Court Road for
     fifty-five shillings. This led him to Paganini, and we sat for an
     hour over a bottle of claret while he told me anecdote after anecdote

[line number in individual story] matching line = 465    window = 460 470

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 59839    window = 59834 59844


     hour over a bottle of claret while he told me anecdote after anecdote
     of that extraordinary man. The afternoon was far advanced and the hot
     glare had softened into a mellow glow before we found ourselves at
     the police-station. Lestrade was waiting for us at the door.

==>      "A telegram for you, Mr. Holmes," said he. <==

     "Ha! It is the answer!" He tore it open, glanced his eyes over it,
     and crumpled it into his pocket. "That's all right," said he.

     "Have you found out anything?"

[line number in individual story] matching line = 481    window = 476 486

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 59855    window = 59850 59860


     "I was never more serious in my life. A shocking crime has been
     committed, and I think I have now laid bare every detail of it."

     "And the criminal?"

==>      Holmes scribbled a few words upon the back of one of his visiting <==
     cards and threw it over to Lestrade.

     "That is the name," he said. "You cannot effect an arrest until
     to-morrow night at the earliest. I should prefer that you do not
     mention my name at all in connection with the case, as I choose to be

[line number in individual story] matching line = 490    window = 485 495

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 59864    window = 59859 59869


     to-morrow night at the earliest. I should prefer that you do not
     mention my name at all in connection with the case, as I choose to be
     only associated with those crimes which present some difficulty in
     their solution. Come on, Watson." We strode off together to the
     station, leaving Lestrade still staring with a delighted face at the
==>      card which Holmes had thrown him. <==

     "The case," said Sherlock Holmes as we chatted over or cigars that
     night in our rooms at Baker Street, "is one where, as in the
     investigations which you have chronicled under the names of 'A Study
     in Scarlet' and of 'The Sign of Four,' we have been compelled to

     only associated with those crimes which present some difficulty in
     their solution. Come on, Watson." We strode off together to the
     station, leaving Lestrade still staring with a delighted face at the
     card which Holmes had thrown him.

     night in our rooms at Baker Street, "is one where, as in the
     investigations which you have chronicled under the names of 'A Study
     in Scarlet' and of 'The Sign of Four,' we have been compelled to
     reason backward from effects to causes. I have written to Lestrade
     asking him to supply us with the details which are now wanting, and

     the May Day, and I calculate that she is due in the Thames tomorrow
     night. When he arrives he will be met by the obtuse but resolute
     Lestrade, and I have no doubt that we shall have all our details
     filled in."

==>      Sherlock Holmes was not disappointed in his expectations. Two days <==
     later he received a bulky envelope, which contained a short note from
     the detective, and a typewritten document, which covered several
     pages of foolscap.

     "Lestrade has got him all right," said Holmes, glancing up at me.

     himself. This is his statement as made before Inspector Montgomery at
     the Shadwell Police Station, and it has the advantage of being

     won't put me alone into a cell, sir?  For pity's sake don't, and may
     you be treated in your day of agony as you treat me now.'

==>      "What is the meaning of it, Watson?" said Holmes solemnly as he laid <==
     down the paper. "What object is served by this circle of misery and
     violence and fear? It must tend to some end, or else our universe is
     ruled by chance, which is unthinkable. But what end? There is the
     great standing perennial problem to which human reason is as far from
     an answer as ever."

     few hours to spare I should be very happy to see you out here. I
     shall be either at the house or in the police-station all day.

==>      "What say you, Watson? Can you rise superior to the heat and run down <==
     to Croydon with me on the off chance of a case for your annals?"

     "I was longing for something to do."

     "You shall have it then. Ring for our boots and tell them to order a

     "How far to Wallington?" he asked.

     "Only about a mile, sir."

==>      "Very good. Jump in, Watson. We must strike while the iron is hot. <==
     Simple as the case is, there have been one or two very instructive
     details in connection with it. Just pull up at a telegraph office as
     you pass, cabby."

     Holmes sent off a short wire and for the rest of the drive lay back

     "That is the name," he said. "You cannot effect an arrest until
     to-morrow night at the earliest. I should prefer that you do not
     mention my name at all in connection with the case, as I choose to be
     only associated with those crimes which present some difficulty in
==>      their solution. Come on, Watson." We strode off together to the <==
     station, leaving Lestrade still staring with a delighted face at the
     card which Holmes had thrown him.

     "The case," said Sherlock Holmes as we chatted over or cigars that
     night in our rooms at Baker Street, "is one where, as in the

     to assure Miss Cushing that I was convinced that a mistake had been
     made when you may remember that I came suddenly to a stop. The fact
     was that I had just seen something which filled me with surprise and
     at the same time narrowed the field of our inquiry immensely.

==>      "As a medical man, you are aware, Watson, that there is no part of <==
     the body which varies so much as the human ear. Each ear is as a rule
     quite distinctive and differs from all other ones. In last year's
     Anthropological Journal you will find two short monographs from my
     pen upon the subject. I had, therefore, examined the ears in the box
     with the eyes of an expert and had carefully noted their anatomical

     "Lestrade has got him all right," said Holmes, glancing up at me.
     "Perhaps it would interest you to hear what he says.

     "My dear Mr. Holmes:
     "In accordance with the scheme which we had formed in order to test

     down to the Albert Dock yesterday at 6 p.m., and boarded the S.S. May
     Day, belonging to the Liverpool, Dublin, and London Steam Packet
     Company. On inquiry, I found that there was a steward on board of the
     name of James Browner and that he had acted during the voyage in such
     an extraordinary manner that the captain had been compelled to

     I killed them quick, but they are killing me slow; and if I have
     another night of it I shall be either mad or dead before morning. You
     won't put me alone into a cell, sir?  For pity's sake don't, and may
     you be treated in your day of agony as you treat me now.'

==>      "What is the meaning of it, Watson?" said Holmes solemnly as he laid <==
     down the paper. "What object is served by this circle of misery and
     violence and fear? It must tend to some end, or else our universe is
     ruled by chance, which is unthinkable. But what end? There is the
     great standing perennial problem to which human reason is as far from
     an answer as ever."

     A shower of rain fell while we were in the train, and the heat was

     us to Cross Street, where Miss Cushing resided.

     a door, which was opened by a small servant girl. Miss Cushing was
     sitting in the front room, into which we were ushered. She was a
     placid-faced woman, with large, gentle eyes, and grizzled hair
     curving down over her temples on each side. A worked antimacassar lay
     upon her lap and a basket of coloured silks stood upon a stool beside

     "So I shall, Miss Cushing. I only kept them here until my friend, Mr.

     "Why in my presence, sir?"

     "The importance lies in the fact that the knot is left intact, and
     that this knot is of a peculiar character."

     printed in rather straggling characters: 'Miss S. Cushing, Cross

     filled with rough salt of the quality used for preserving hides and
     other of the coarser commercial purposes. And embedded in it are
     these very singular enclosures."

     He took out the two ears as he spoke, and laying a board across his
==>      knee he examined them minutely, while Lestrade and I, bending forward <==
     on each side of him, glanced alternately at these dreadful relics and
     at the thoughtful, eager face of our companion. Finally he returned
     them to the box once more and sat for a while in deep meditation.

     "You have observed, of course," said he at last, "that the ears are

     here, but that we are investigating a serious crime."

     A vague thrill ran through me as I listened to my companion's words
     and saw the stern gravity which had hardened his features. This
     brutal preliminary seemed to shadow forth some strange and

     head like a man who is only half convinced.

     the garden fence, but now he sprang briskly to his feet and walked
     towards the house.

     "I have a few questions to ask Miss Cushing," said he.

     another small business on hand. I think that I have nothing further
     to learn from Miss Cushing. You will find me at the police-station."

     "We shall look in on our way to the train," answered Holmes. A moment
     later he and I were back in the front room, where the impassive lady

     "Perhaps she could not or would not have told you much."

     some decent hotel, cabby, where we may have some lunch, and

     We had a pleasant little meal together, during which Holmes would
     talk about nothing but violins, narrating with great exultation how
     he had purchased his own Stradivarius, which was worth at least five

     hundred guineas, at a Jew broker's in Tottenham Court Road for
     fifty-five shillings. This led him to Paganini, and we sat for an
     hour over a bottle of claret while he told me anecdote after anecdote
     of that extraordinary man. The afternoon was far advanced and the hot
     glare had softened into a mellow glow before we found ourselves at

     "A telegram for you, Mr. Holmes," said he.

     "Ha! It is the answer!" He tore it open, glanced his eyes over it,
     and crumpled it into his pocket. "That's all right," said he.

     "Have you found out anything?"

     "I have found out everything!"

     "I was never more serious in my life. A shocking crime has been
     committed, and I think I have now laid bare every detail of it."

     "And the criminal?"

     "That is the name," he said. "You cannot effect an arrest until

     night. When he arrives he will be met by the obtuse but resolute

     Sherlock Holmes was not disappointed in his expectations. Two days
     later he received a bulky envelope, which contained a short note from
     the detective, and a typewritten document, which covered several
