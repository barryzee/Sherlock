==>      "My dear fellow," said Sherlock Holmes as we sat on either side of <==
     the fire in his lodgings at Baker Street, "life is infinitely
     stranger than anything which the mind of man could invent. We would
     not dare to conceive the things which are really mere commonplaces of
     existence. If we could fly out of that window hand in hand, hover
     over this great city, gently remove the roofs, and peep in at the

     enough. We have in our police reports realism pushed to its extreme
     limits, and yet the result is, it must be confessed, neither
     fascinating nor artistic."

     "A certain selection and discretion must be used in producing a
==>      realistic effect," remarked Holmes. "This is wanting in the police <==
     report, where more stress is laid, perhaps, upon the platitudes of
     the magistrate than upon the details, which to an observer contain
     the vital essence of the whole matter. Depend upon it, there is
     nothing so unnatural as the commonplace."

     perfectly familiar to me. There is, of course, the other woman, the
     drink, the push, the blow, the bruise, the sympathetic sister or
     landlady. The crudest of writers could invent nothing more crude."

     "Indeed, your example is an unfortunate one for your argument," said
==>      Holmes, taking the paper and glancing his eye down it. "This is the <==
     Dundas separation case, and, as it happens, I was engaged in clearing
     up some small points in connection with it. The husband was a
     teetotaler, there was no other woman, and the conduct complained of
     was that he had drifted into the habit of winding up every meal by
     taking out his false teeth and hurling them at his wife, which, you

     our windows, while her body oscillated backward and forward, and her
     fingers fidgeted with her glove buttons. Suddenly, with a plunge, as
     of the swimmer who leaves the bank, she hurried across the road, and
     we heard the sharp clang of the bell.

==>      "I have seen those symptoms before," said Holmes, throwing his <==
     cigarette into the fire. "Oscillation upon the pavement always means
     an affaire de coeur. She would like advice, but is not sure that the
     matter is not too delicate for communication. And yet even here we
     may discriminate. When a woman has been seriously wronged by a man
     she no longer oscillates, and the usual symptom is a broken bell

     comes in person to resolve our doubts."

     As he spoke there was a tap at the door, and the boy in buttons
     entered to announce Miss Mary Sutherland, while the lady herself
     loomed behind his small black figure like a full-sailed merchant-man
==>      behind a tiny pilot boat. Sherlock Holmes welcomed her with the easy <==
     courtesy for which he was remarkable, and, having closed the door and
     bowed her into an armchair, he looked her over in the minute and yet
     abstracted fashion which was peculiar to him.

     "Do you not find," he said, "that with your short sight it is a

     "I did at first," she answered, "but now I know where the letters are
     without looking." Then, suddenly realising the full purport of his
     words, she gave a violent start and looked up, with fear and
     astonishment upon her broad, good-humoured face. "You've heard about
==>      me, Mr. Holmes," she cried, "else how could you know all that?" <==

     "Never mind," said Holmes, laughing; "it is my business to know
     things. Perhaps I have trained myself to see what others overlook. If
     not, why should you come to consult me?"

     "I came to you, sir, because I heard of you from Mrs. Etherege, whose
     husband you found so easy when the police and everyone had given him

     not rich, but still I have a hundred a year in my own right, besides
     the little that I make by the machine, and I would give it all to
     know what has become of Mr. Hosmer Angel."

     "Why did you come away to consult me in such a hurry?" asked Sherlock

[line number in individual story] matching line = 132    window = 127 137

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 11519    window = 11514 11524

     "Why did you come away to consult me in such a hurry?" asked Sherlock

     Again a startled look came over the somewhat vacuous face of Miss
     Mary Sutherland. "Yes, I did bang out of the house," she said, "for
     it made me angry to see the easy way in which Mr. Windibank--that is,
     my father--took it all. He would not go to the police, and he would

     my father--took it all. He would not go to the police, and he would
     not go to you, and so at last, as he would do nothing and kept on
     saying that there was no harm done, it made me mad, and I just on
     with my things and came right away to you."

==>      "Your father," said Holmes, "your stepfather, surely, since the name <==
     is different."

     "Yes, my stepfather. I call him father, though it sounds funny, too,
     for he is only five years and two months older than myself."


[line number in individual story] matching line = 151    window = 146 156

     "And your mother is alive?"

     "Oh, yes, mother is alive and well. I wasn't best pleased, Mr.
==>      Holmes, when she married again so soon after father's death, and a <==
     man who was nearly fifteen years younger than herself. Father was a
     plumber in the Tottenham Court Road, and he left a tidy business
     behind him, which mother carried on with Mr. Hardy, the foreman; but
     when Mr. Windibank came he made her sell the business, for he was
     very superior, being a traveller in wines. They got Â£4700 for the

     when Mr. Windibank came he made her sell the business, for he was
     very superior, being a traveller in wines. They got Â£4700 for the
     goodwill and interest, which wasn't near as much as father could have
     got if he had been alive."

==>      I had expected to see Sherlock Holmes impatient under this rambling <==
     and inconsequential narrative, but, on the contrary, he had listened
     with the greatest concentration of attention.

     "Your own little income," he asked, "does it come out of the
     business?"

[line number in individual story] matching line = 172    window = 167 177

     "Oh, no, sir. It is quite separate and was left me by my uncle Ned in
     Auckland. It is in New Zealand stock, paying 4Â½ per cent. Two
     thousand five hundred pounds was the amount, but I can only touch the
     interest."

==>      "You interest me extremely," said Holmes. "And since you draw so <==
     large a sum as a hundred a year, with what you earn into the bargain,
     you no doubt travel a little and indulge yourself in every way. I
     believe that a single lady can get on very nicely upon an income of
     about Â£60."

==>      "I could do with much less than that, Mr. Holmes, but you understand <==
     that as long as I live at home I don't wish to be a burden to them,
     and so they have the use of the money just while I am staying with
     them. Of course, that is only just for the time. Mr. Windibank draws
     my interest every quarter and pays it over to mother, and I find that
     I can do pretty well with what I earn at typewriting. It brings me

     I can do pretty well with what I earn at typewriting. It brings me
     twopence a sheet, and I can often do from fifteen to twenty sheets in
     a day."

==>      "You have made your position very clear to me," said Holmes. "This is <==
     my friend, Dr. Watson, before whom you can speak as freely as before
     myself. Kindly tell us now all about your connection with Mr. Hosmer
     Angel."

     A flush stole over Miss Sutherland's face, and she picked nervously

     so much as taken out of the drawer. At last, when nothing else would
     do, he went off to France upon the business of the firm, but we went,
     mother and I, with Mr. Hardy, who used to be our foreman, and it was
     there I met Mr. Hosmer Angel."

==>      "I suppose," said Holmes, "that when Mr. Windibank came back from <==
     France he was very annoyed at your having gone to the ball."

     "Oh, well, he was very good about it. He laughed, I remember, and
     shrugged his shoulders, and said there was no use denying anything to
     a woman, for she would have her way."

     "I see. Then at the gasfitters' ball you met, as I understand, a
     gentleman called Mr. Hosmer Angel."

     "Yes, sir. I met him that night, and he called next day to ask if we
     had got home all safe, and after that we met him--that is to say, Mr.

     again, and Mr. Hosmer Angel could not come to the house any more."

     "No?"

     to write every day. I took the letters in in the morning, so there
     was no need for father to know."

     "Were you engaged to the gentleman at this time?"

==>      "Oh, yes, Mr. Holmes. We were engaged after the first walk that we <==
     took. Hosmer--Mr. Angel--was a cashier in an office in Leadenhall
     Street--and--"

     "What office?"

     "Where did he live, then?"

     the other clerks about having letters from a lady, so I offered to
     typewrite them, like he did his, but he wouldn't have that, for he
     said that when I wrote them they seemed to come from me, but when

     father; but they both said never to mind about father, but just to

     Bordeaux, where the company has its French offices, but the letter

     sleep a wink at night." She pulled a little handkerchief out of her
     muff and began to sob heavily into it.

     A professional case of great gravity was engaging my own attention at
     the time, and the whole of next day I was busy at the bedside of the
     sufferer. It was not until close upon six o'clock that I found myself

     half afraid that I might be too late to assist at the dÃ©nouement of

     insinuating manner, and a pair of wonderfully sharp and penetrating
     grey eyes. He shot a questioning glance at each of us, placed his
     shiny top-hat upon the sideboard, and with a slight bow sidled down
     into the nearest chair.

==>      "Good-evening, Mr. James Windibank," said Holmes. "I think that this <==
     typewritten letter is from you, in which you made an appointment with
     me for six o'clock?"

     "Yes, sir. I am afraid that I am a little late, but I am not quite my
     own master, you know. I am sorry that Miss Sutherland has troubled

     her mind on a point. Of course, I did not mind you so much, as you
     are not connected with the official police, but it is not pleasant to
     have a family misfortune like this noised abroad. Besides, it is a
     useless expense, for how could you possibly find this Hosmer Angel?"

==>      "On the contrary," said Holmes quietly; "I have every reason to <==
     believe that I will succeed in discovering Mr. Hosmer Angel."

     Mr. Windibank gave a violent start and dropped his gloves. "I am
     delighted to hear it," he said.


[line number in individual story] matching line = 595    window = 590 600

     believe that I will succeed in discovering Mr. Hosmer Angel."

     Mr. Windibank gave a violent start and dropped his gloves. "I am
     delighted to hear it," he said.

==>      "It is a curious thing," remarked Holmes, "that a typewriter has <==
     really quite as much individuality as a man's handwriting. Unless
     they are quite new, no two of them write exactly alike. Some letters
     get more worn than others, and some wear only on one side. Now, you
     remark in this note of yours, Mr. Windibank, that in every case there
     is some little slurring over of the 'e,' and a slight defect in the

     tail of the 'r.' There are fourteen other characteristics, but those
     are the more obvious."

     "We do all our correspondence with this machine at the office, and no
     doubt it is a little worn," our visitor answered, glancing keenly at
==>      Holmes with his bright little eyes. <==

     "And now I will show you what is really a very interesting study, Mr.
     Windibank," Holmes continued. "I think of writing another little
     monograph some of these days on the typewriter and its relation to
     crime. It is a subject to which I have devoted some little attention.

     crime. It is a subject to which I have devoted some little attention.
     I have here four letters which purport to come from the missing man.
     They are all typewritten. In each case, not only are the 'e's'
     slurred and the 'r's' tailless, but you will observe, if you care to

     slurred and the 'r's' tailless, but you will observe, if you care to
     use my magnifying lens, that the fourteen other characteristics to
     which I have alluded are there as well."

     Mr. Windibank sprang out of his chair and picked up his hat. "I
==>      cannot waste time over this sort of fantastic talk, Mr. Holmes," he <==
     said. "If you can catch the man, catch him, and let me know when you
     have done it."

     "Certainly," said Holmes, stepping over and turning the key in the
     door. "I let you know, then, that I have caught him!"

     "What! where?" shouted Mr. Windibank, turning white to his lips and
     glancing about him like a rat in a trap.

==>      "Oh, it won't do--really it won't," said Holmes suavely. "There is no <==
     possible getting out of it, Mr. Windibank. It is quite too
     transparent, and it was a very bad compliment when you said that it
     was impossible for me to solve so simple a question. That's right!
     Sit down and let us talk it over."

     Windibank, it was as cruel and selfish and heartless a trick in a
     petty way as ever came before me. Now, let me just run over the
     course of events, and you will contradict me if I go wrong."

     The man sat huddled up in his chair, with his head sunk upon his
==>      breast, like one who is utterly crushed. Holmes stuck his feet up on <==
     the corner of the mantelpiece and, leaning back with his hands in his
     pockets, began talking, rather to himself, as it seemed, than to us.

     "The man married a woman very much older than himself for her money,"
     said he, "and he enjoyed the use of the money of the daughter as long

     listen to another man. As far as the church door he brought her, and
     then, as he could go no farther, he conveniently vanished away by the
     old trick of stepping in at one door of a four-wheeler and out at the
     other. I think that was the chain of events, Mr. Windibank!"

==>      Our visitor had recovered something of his assurance while Holmes had <==
     been talking, and he rose from his chair now with a cold sneer upon
     his pale face.

     "It may be so, or it may not, Mr. Holmes," said he, "but if you are

     are breaking the law now, and not me. I have done nothing actionable

     punishment more. If the young lady has a brother or a friend, he

     steps to the whip, but before he could grasp it there was a wild
     clatter of steps upon the stairs, the heavy hall door banged, and
     from the window we could see Mr. James Windibank running at the top
     of his speed down the road.

==>      "There's a cold-blooded scoundrel!" said Holmes, laughing, as he <==
     threw himself down into his chair once more. "That fellow will rise
     from crime to crime until he does something very bad, and ends on a
     gallows. The case has, in some respects, been not entirely devoid of
     interest."

     to me," I remarked.

     realise the importance of sleeves, the suggestiveness of thumb-nails,
     or the great issues that may hang from a boot-lace. Now, what did you
     gather from that woman's appearance? Describe it."

     Sherlock Holmes clapped his hands softly together and chuckled.

     torn at the forefinger, but you did not apparently see that both
     glove and finger were stained with violet ink. She had written in a
