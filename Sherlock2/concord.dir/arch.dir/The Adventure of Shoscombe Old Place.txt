==>      Sherlock Holmes had been bending for a long time over a low-power <==
     microscope. Now he straightened himself up and looked round at me in
     triumph.

     "It is glue, Watson," said he. "Unquestionably it is glue. Have a
     look at these scattered objects in the field!"

     can you give me some idea of Shoscombe Old Place?"

     "Only that it is in the centre of Shoscombe Park, and that the famous
     Shoscombe stud and training quarters are to be found there."

==>      "And the head trainer," said Holmes, "is John Mason. You need not <==
     look surprised at my knowledge, Watson, for this is a letter from him
     which I am unfolding. But let us have some more about Shoscombe. I
     seem to have struck a rich vein."

     "There are the Shoscombe spaniels," said I. "You hear of them at

     The door had opened and the page had shown in a tall, clean-shaven
     man with the firm, austere expression which is only seen upon those
     who have to control horses or boys. Mr. John Mason had many of both
     under his sway, and he looked equal to the task. He bowed with cold
==>      self-possession and seated himself upon the chair to which Holmes had <==
     waved him.

     "You had my note, Mr. Holmes?"

     "Yes, but it explained nothing."

     self-possession and seated himself upon the chair to which Holmes had
     waved him.

==>      "You had my note, Mr. Holmes?" <==

     "Yes, but it explained nothing."

     "It was too delicate a thing for me to put the details on paper. And
     too complicated. It was only face to face I could do it."

     "It was too delicate a thing for me to put the details on paper. And

     "Well, we are at your disposal."

==>      "First of all, Mr. Holmes, I think that my employer, Sir Robert, has <==
     gone mad."

     Holmes raised his eyebrows. "This is Baker Street, not Harley
     Street," said he. "But why do you say so?"

     Street," said he. "But why do you say so?"

     "Well, sir, when a man does one queer thing, or two queer things,
     there may be a meaning to it, but when everything he does is queer,
     then you begin to wonder. I believe Shoscombe Prince and the Derby

     then you begin to wonder. I believe Shoscombe Prince and the Derby
     have turned his brain."

     "That is a colt you are running?"

==>      "The best in England, Mr. Holmes. I should know, if anyone does. Now, <==
     I'll be plain with you, for I know you are gentlemen of honour and
     that it won't go beyond the room. Sir Robert has got to win this
     Derby. He's up to the neck, and it's his last chance. Everything he
     could raise or borrow is on the horse--and at fine odds, too! You can
     get forties now, but it was nearer the hundred when he began to back

     "Of course, with her weak heart and dropsy one couldn't expect that
     she could get about with him, but he spent two hours every evening in
     her room. He might well do what he could, for she has been a rare
     good friend to him. But that's all over, too. He never goes near her.
     And she takes it to heart. She is brooding and sulky and drinking,
==>      Mr. Holmes--drinking like a fish." <==

     "Did she drink before this estrangement?"

     "Well, she took her glass, but now it is often a whole bottle of an
     evening. So Stephens, the butler, told me. It's all changed, Mr.

     again, what is master doing down at the old church crypt at night?
     And who is the man that meets him there?"

     Holmes rubbed his hands.

     "Go on, Mr. Mason. You get more and more interesting."

     "It was the butler who saw him go. Twelve o'clock at night and
     raining hard. So next night I was up at the house and, sure enough,

     has a bad name among us. It's a dark, damp, lonely place by day, but
     there are few in that county that would have the nerve to go near it
     at night. But master's not afraid. He never feared anything in his
     life. But what is he doing there in the night-time?"

==>      "Wait a bit!" said Holmes. "You say there is another man there. It <==
     must be one of your own stablemen, or someone from the house! Surely
     you have only to spot who it is and question him?"

     "It's no one I know."

     "It's no one I know."

     "How can you say that?"

==>      "Because I have seen him, Mr. Holmes. It was on that second night. <==
     Sir Robert turned and passed us--me and Stephens, quaking in the
     bushes like two bunny-rabbits, for there was a bit of moon that
     night. But we could hear the other moving about behind. We were not
     afraid of him. So we up when Sir Robert was gone and pretended we
     were just having a walk like in the moonlight, and so we came right

     "But you saw him clearly in the moonlight?"

     "Yes, I would swear to his yellow face--a mean dog, I should say.
     What could he have in common with Sir Robert?"

==>      Holmes sat for some time lost in thought. <==

     "Who keeps Lady Beatrice Falder company?" he asked at last.

     "There is her maid, Carrie Evans. She has been with her this five
     years."

     Mr. Mason shuffled uncomfortably.

     "She's devoted enough," he answered at last. "But I won't say to
     whom."

==>      "Ah!" said Holmes. <==

     "I can't tell tales out of school."

     "I quite understand, Mr. Mason. Of course, the situation is clear
     enough. From Dr. Watson's description of Sir Robert I can realize

     by night to the old crypt? We can't fit that into our plot."

     "No, sir, and there is something more that I can't fit in. Why should
     Sir Robert want to dig up a dead body?"

==>      Holmes sat up abruptly. <==

     "We only found it out yesterday--after I had written to you.
     Yesterday Sir Robert had gone to London, so Stephens and I went down
     to the crypt. It was all in order, sir, except that in one corner was
     a bit of a human body."

     old well-house, and Sir Robert was in one of his tantrums that
     morning. He caught it up, and I thought he would have killed it. Then
     he gave it to Sandy Bain, the jockey, and told him to take the dog to
     old Barnes at the Green Dragon, for he never wished to see it again."

==>      Holmes sat for some time in silent thought. He had lit the oldest and <==
     foulest of his pipes.

     "I am not clear yet what you want me to do in this matter, Mr.
     Mason," he said at last. "Can't you make it more definite?"


[line number in individual story] matching line = 314    window = 309 319

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 74619    window = 74614 74624


     foulest of his pipes.

     "I am not clear yet what you want me to do in this matter, Mr.
     Mason," he said at last. "Can't you make it more definite?"

==>      "Perhaps this will make it more definite, Mr. Holmes," said our <==
     visitor.

     He took a paper from his pocket, and, unwrapping it carefully, he
     exposed a charred fragment of bone.


[line number in individual story] matching line = 320    window = 315 325

     visitor.

     He took a paper from his pocket, and, unwrapping it carefully, he
     exposed a charred fragment of bone.

==>      Holmes examined it with interest. <==

     "Where did you get it?"

     "There is a central heating furnace in the cellar under Lady
     Beatrice's room. It's been off for some time, but Sir Robert

[line number in individual story] matching line = 330    window = 325 335

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 74635    window = 74630 74640


     Beatrice's room. It's been off for some time, but Sir Robert
     complained of cold and had it on again. Harvey runs it--he's one of
     my lads. This very morning he came to me with this which he found
     raking out the cinders. He didn't like the look of it."

==>      "Nor do I," said Holmes. "What do you make of it, Watson?" <==

     It was burned to a black cinder, but there could be no question as to
     its anatomical significance.

     "It's the upper condyle of a human femur," said I.

[line number in individual story] matching line = 337    window = 332 342

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 74642    window = 74637 74647


     It was burned to a black cinder, but there could be no question as to
     its anatomical significance.

     "It's the upper condyle of a human femur," said I.

==>      "Exactly!" Holmes had become very serious. "When does this lad tend <==
     to the furnace?"

     "He makes it up every evening and then leaves it."

     "Then anyone could visit it during the night?"

[line number in individual story] matching line = 378    window = 373 383

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 74683    window = 74678 74688


     reach it to-night. I need not say that we don't want to see you, Mr.
     Mason, but a note will reach us, and no doubt I could find you if I
     want you. When we have gone a little farther into the matter I will
     let you have a considered opinion."

==>      Thus it was that on a bright May evening Holmes and I found ourselves <==
     alone in a first-class carriage and bound for the little
     "halt-on-demand" station of Shoscombe. The rack above us was covered
     with a formidable litter of rods, reels, and baskets. On reaching our
     destination a short drive took us to an old-fashioned tavern, where a
     sporting host, Josiah Barnes, entered eagerly into our plans for the

     with a formidable litter of rods, reels, and baskets. On reaching our
     destination a short drive took us to an old-fashioned tavern, where a
     sporting host, Josiah Barnes, entered eagerly into our plans for the
     extirpation of the fish of the neighbourhood.

==>      "What about the Hall lake and the chance of a pike?" said Holmes. <==

     The face of the innkeeper clouded.

     "That wouldn't do, sir. You might chance to find yourself in the lake
     before you were through."

     beautiful spaniel that was whining in the hall."

     "I should say it was. That was the real Shoscombe breed. There ain't
     a better in England."

==>      "I am a dog-fancier myself," said Holmes. "Now, if it is a fair <==
     question, what would a prize dog like that cost?"

     "More than I could pay, sir. It was Sir Robert himself who gave me
     this one. That's why I have to keep it on a lead. It would be off to
     the Hall in a jiffy if I gave it its head."

[line number in individual story] matching line = 426    window = 421 431

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 74731    window = 74726 74736

     this one. That's why I have to keep it on a lead. It would be off to
     the Hall in a jiffy if I gave it its head."

==>      "We are getting some cards in our hand, Watson," said Holmes when the <==
     landlord had left us. "It's not an easy one to play, but we may see
     our way in a day or two. By the way, Sir Robert is still in London, I
     hear. We might, perhaps, enter the sacred domain to-night without
     fear of bodily assault. There are one or two points on which I should
     like reassurance."

     hear. We might, perhaps, enter the sacred domain to-night without
     fear of bodily assault. There are one or two points on which I should
     like reassurance."

==>      "Have you any theory, Holmes?" <==

     "Only this, Watson, that something happened a week or so ago which
     has cut deep into the life of the Shoscombe household. What is that
     something? We can only guess at it from its effects. They seem to be
     of a curiously mixed character. But that should surely help us. It is

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 74780    window = 74775 74785



     "Ah, yes, the crypt! Let us suppose, Watson--it is merely a
     scandalous supposition, a hypothesis put forward for argument's
     sake--that Sir Robert has done away with his sister."

==>      "My dear Holmes, it is out of the question." <==

     "Very possibly, Watson. Sir Robert is a man of an honourable stock.
     But you do occasionally find a carrion crow among the eagles. Let us
     for a moment argue upon this supposition. He could not fly the
     country until he had realized his fortune, and that fortune could

     mean to keep up our characters, I suggest that we have our host in
     for a glass of his own wine and hold some high converse upon eels and
     dace, which seems to be the straight road to his affections. We may
     chance to come upon some useful local gossip in the process."

==>      In the morning Holmes discovered that we had come without our <==
     spoon-bait for jack, which absolved us from fishing for the day.
     About eleven o'clock we started for a walk, and he obtained leave to
     take the black spaniel with us.

     "This is the place," said he as we came to two high park gates with

[line number in individual story] matching line = 516    window = 511 521

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 74821    window = 74816 74826


     question. Never mind me. I shall stand behind this holly-bush and see
     what I can see."

     It was not a long vigil. Within a quarter of an hour we saw the big
     open yellow barouche coming down the long avenue, with two splendid,
==>      high-stepping gray carriage horses in the shafts. Holmes crouched <==
     behind his bush with the dog. I stood unconcernedly swinging a cane
     in the roadway. A keeper ran out and the gates swung open.

     The carriage had slowed to a walk, and I was able to get a good look
     at the occupants. A highly coloured young woman with flaxen hair and

[line number in individual story] matching line = 528    window = 523 533

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 74833    window = 74828 74838


     with rounded back and a huddle of shawls about her face and shoulders
     which proclaimed the invalid. When the horses reached the highroad I
     held up my hand with an authoritative gesture, and as the coachman
     pulled up I inquired if Sir Robert was at Shoscombe Old Place.

==>      At the same moment Holmes stepped out and released the spaniel. With <==
     a joyous cry it dashed forward to the carriage and sprang upon the
     step. Then in a moment its eager greeting changed to furious rage,
     and it snapped at the black skirt above it.

     "Drive on! Drive on!" shrieked a harsh voice. The coachman lashed the

     and it snapped at the black skirt above it.

     "Drive on! Drive on!" shrieked a harsh voice. The coachman lashed the
     horses, and we were left standing in the roadway.

==>      "Well, Watson, that's done it," said Holmes as he fastened the lead <==
     to the neck of the excited spaniel. "He thought it was his mistress,
     and he found it was a stranger. Dogs don't make mistakes."

     "But it was the voice of a man!" I cried.

     careful playing, all the same."

     My companion seemed to have no further plans for the day, and we did
     actually use our fishing tackle in the mill-stream, with the result
     that we had a dish of trout for our supper. It was only after that
==>      meal that Holmes showed signs of renewed activity. Once more we found <==
     ourselves upon the same road as in the morning, which led us to the
     park gates. A tall, dark figure was awaiting us there, who proved to
     be our London acquaintance, Mr. John Mason, the trainer.

     "Good-evening, gentlemen," said he. "I got your note, Mr. Holmes. Sir

     Robert has not returned yet, but I hear that he is expected
     to-night."

     "How far is this crypt from the house?" asked Holmes.

     "A good quarter of a mile."

     "Then I think we can disregard him altogether."

     "A good quarter of a mile."

     "Then I think we can disregard him altogether."

==>      "I can't afford to do that, Mr. Holmes. The moment he arrives he will <==
     want to see me to get the last news of Shoscombe Prince."

     "I see! In that case we must work without you, Mr. Mason. You can
     show us the crypt and then leave us."

     picked his way to the corner of the building, where a steep stair led
     down into the crypt. Striking a match, he illuminated the melancholy
     place--dismal and evil-smelling, with ancient crumbling walls of
     rough-hewn stone, and piles of coffins, some of lead and some of
     stone, extending upon one side right up to the arched and groined
==>      roof which lost itself in the shadows above our heads. Holmes had lit <==
     his lantern, which shot a tiny tunnel of vivid yellow light upon the
     mournful scene. Its rays were reflected back from the coffin-plates,
     many of them adorned with the griffin and coronet of this old family
     which carried its honours even to the gate of Death.

     "They are here in this corner." The trainer strode across and then
     stood in silent surprise as our light was turned upon the place.
     "They are gone," said he.

==>      "So I expected," said Holmes, chuckling. "I fancy the ashes of them <==
     might even now be found in that oven which had already consumed a
     part."

     "But why in the world would anyone want to burn the bones of a man
     who has been dead a thousand years?" asked John Mason.

     who has been dead a thousand years?" asked John Mason.

     long search, and we need not detain you. I fancy that we shall get
     our solution before morning."

     When John Mason had left us, Holmes set to work making a very careful
     examination of the graves, ranging from a very ancient one, which

     appeared to be Saxon, in the centre, through a long line of Norman
     Hugos and Odos, until we reached the Sir William and Sir Denis Falder

     to a leaden coffin standing on end before the entrance to the vault.

     I heard his little cry of satisfaction and was aware from his hurried
     but purposeful movements that he had reached a goal. With his lens he
     was eagerly examining the edges of the heavy lid. Then he drew from
     his pocket a short jemmy, a box-opener, which he thrust into a chink,

     strong, heavily moustached face and angry eyes, which glared round
     him into every recess of the vault, finally fixing themselves with a
     deadly stare upon my companion and myself.

     "Who the devil are you?" he thundered. "And what are you doing upon

     steps forward and raised a heavy stick which he carried. "Do you hear
     me?" he cried. "Who are you? What are you doing here?" His cudgel
     quivered in the air.

     But instead of shrinking Holmes advanced to meet him.

     of his truculent manner: "What business is it of yours?"

     familiar to you. In any case, my business is that of every other good

     creditor is, unhappily, my most bitter enemy--a rascally fellow, Sam
     Brewer, whom I was once compelled to horsewhip on Newmarket Heath. Do
     you suppose that he would try to save me?"

     Sherlock Holmes had been bending for a long time over a low-power

     conveyed to the crypt, which is a place so seldom visited, and it
     might be secretly destroyed at night in the furnace, leaving behind

     to the neck of the excited spaniel. "He thought it was his mistress,
