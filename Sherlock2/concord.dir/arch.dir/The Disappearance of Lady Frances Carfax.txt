==>      "But why Turkish?" asked Mr. Sherlock Holmes, gazing fixedly at my <==
     boots. I was reclining in a cane-backed chair at the moment, and my
     protruded feet had attracted his ever-active attention.

     "English," I answered in some surprise. "I got them at Latimer's, in
     Oxford Street."

     protruded feet had attracted his ever-active attention.

     "English," I answered in some surprise. "I got them at Latimer's, in
     Oxford Street."

==>      Holmes smiled with an expression of weary patience. <==

     "The bath!" he said; "the bath! Why the relaxing and expensive
     Turkish rather than the invigorating home-made article?"

     "Because for the last few days I have been feeling rheumatic and old.

     "Because for the last few days I have been feeling rheumatic and old.
     A Turkish bath is what we call an alterative in medicine--a fresh
     starting-point, a cleanser of the system.

==>      "By the way, Holmes," I added, "I have no doubt the connection <==
     between my boots and a Turkish bath is a perfectly self-evident one
     to a logical mind, and yet I should be obliged to you if you would
     indicate it."

     "The train of reasoning is not very obscure, Watson," said Holmes

     with a mischievous twinkle. "It belongs to the same elementary class
     of deduction which I should illustrate if I were to ask you who
     shared your cab in your drive this morning."

     "I don't admit that a fresh illustration is an explanation," said I

     Watson--first-class tickets and all expenses paid on a princely
     scale?"

     "Splendid! But why?"

==>      Holmes leaned back in his armchair and took his notebook from his <==
     pocket.

     "One of the most dangerous classes in the world," said he, "is the
     drifting and friendless woman. She is the most harmless and often the
     most useful of mortals, but she is the inevitable inciter of crime in

     boardinghouses. She is a stray chicken in a world of foxes. When she
     is gobbled up she is hardly missed. I much fear that some evil has
     come to the Lady Frances Carfax."

     I was relieved at this sudden descent from the general to the
==>      particular. Holmes consulted his notes. <==

     "Lady Frances," he continued, "is the sole survivor of the direct
     family of the late Earl of Rufton. The estates went, as you may
     remember, in the male line. She was left with limited means, but with
     some very remarkable old Spanish jewellery of silver and curiously

     servants that the heavy trunk in the lady's bedroom was always
     scrupulously locked. Marie Devine, the maid, was as popular as her
     mistress. She was actually engaged to one of the head waiters in the
     hotel, and there was no difficulty in getting her address. It was 11
     Rue de Trajan, Montpellier. All this I jotted down and felt that
==>      Holmes himself could not have been more adroit in collecting his <==
     facts.

     Only one corner still remained in the shadow. No light which I
     possessed could clear up the cause for the lady's sudden departure.
     She was very happy at Lausanne. There was every reason to believe

     Lausanne. Concerning this there had been some secrecy, which
     confirmed the idea that she had gone with the intention of throwing
     someone off her track. Otherwise why should not her luggage have been
     openly labelled for Baden? Both she and it reached the Rhenish spa by
     some circuitous route. This much I gathered from the manager of
==>      Cook's local office. So to Baden I went, after dispatching to Holmes <==
     an account of all my proceedings and receiving in reply a telegram of
     half-humorous commendation.

     At Baden the track was not difficult to follow. Lady Frances had
     stayed at the Englischer Hof for a fortnight. While there she had

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 63399    window = 63394 63404


     Was that the secret of her continued silence? Could the good people
     who were her companions not screen her from his violence or his
     blackmail? What horrible purpose, what deep design, lay behind this
     long pursuit? There was the problem which I had to solve.

==>      To Holmes I wrote showing how rapidly and surely I had got down to <==
     the roots of the matter. In reply I had a telegram asking for a
     description of Dr. Shlessinger's left ear. Holmes's ideas of humour
     are strange and occasionally offensive, so I took no notice of his
     ill-timed jest--indeed, I had already reached Montpellier in my
     pursuit of the maid, Marie, before his message came.

     "Well, Watson," said he, "a very pretty hash you have made of it! I
     rather think you had better come back with me to London by the night
     express."

==>      An hour afterwards, Sherlock Holmes, in his usual garb and style, was <==
     seated in my private room at the hotel. His explanation of his sudden
     and opportune appearance was simplicity itself, for, finding that he
     could get away from London, he determined to head me off at the next
     obvious point of my travels. In the disguise of a workingman he had
     sat in the cabaret waiting for my appearance.

     A card had come up on a salver, and it was followed by the same
     bearded ruffian who had attacked me in the street. He started when he
     saw me.

==>      "What is this, Mr. Holmes?" he asked. "I had your note and I have <==
     come. But what has this man to do with the matter?"

     "This is my old friend and associate, Dr. Watson, who is helping us
     in this affair."

     apology.

     "I hope I didn't harm you. When you accused me of hurting her I lost
     my grip of myself. Indeed, I'm not responsible in these days. My
     nerves are like live wires. But this situation is beyond me. What I
==>      want to know, in the first place, Mr. Holmes, is, how in the world <==
     you came to hear of my existence at all."

     "I am in touch with Miss Dobney, Lady Frances's governess."

     "Old Susan Dobney with the mob cap! I remember her well."

     "And she remembers you. It was in the days before--before you found
     it better to go to South Africa."

     "Ah, I see you know my whole story. I need hide nothing from you. I
==>      swear to you, Mr. Holmes, that there never was in this world a man <==
     who loved a woman with a more wholehearted love than I had for
     Frances. I was a wild youngster, I know--not worse than others of my
     class. But her mind was pure as snow. She could not bear a shadow of
     coarseness. So, when she came to hear of things that I had done, she
     would have no more to say to me. And yet she loved me--that is the

     her to Baden, and then after a time heard that her maid was here. I'm
     a rough fellow, fresh from a rough life, and when Dr. Watson spoke to
     me as he did I lost hold of myself for a moment. But for God's sake
     tell me what has become of the Lady Frances."

==>      "That is for us to find out," said Sherlock Holmes with peculiar <==
     gravity. "What is your London address, Mr. Green?"

     "The Langham Hotel will find me."

     "Then may I recommend that you return there and be on hand in case I

     Now, Watson, if you will pack your bag I will cable to Mrs. Hudson to
     make one of her best efforts for two hungry travellers at 7.30
     to-morrow."

     A telegram was awaiting us when we reached our Baker Street rooms,
==>      which Holmes read with an exclamation of interest and threw across to <==
     me. "Jagged or torn," was the message, and the place of origin,
     Baden.

     "What is this?" I asked.


[line number in individual story] matching line = 377    window = 372 382

     me. "Jagged or torn," was the message, and the place of origin,
     Baden.

     "What is this?" I asked.

==>      "It is everything," Holmes answered. "You may remember my seemingly <==
     irrelevant question as to this clerical gentleman's left ear. You did
     not answer it."

     "I had left Baden and could not inquire."


[line number in individual story] matching line = 413    window = 408 418

     in London, but as we have at present no possible means of telling
     where, we can only take the obvious steps, eat our dinner, and
     possess our souls in patience. Later in the evening I will stroll
     down and have a word with friend Lestrade at Scotland Yard."

==>      But neither the official police nor Holmes's own small but very <==
     efficient organization sufficed to clear away the mystery. Amid the
     crowded millions of London the three persons we sought were as
     completely obliterated as if they had never lived. Advertisements
     were tried, and failed. Clues were followed, and led to nothing.
     Every criminal resort which Shlessinger might frequent was drawn in

     Three times had our bearded friend from the Langham called for
     news--the third time within an hour of this fresh development. His
     clothes were getting looser on his great body. He seemed to be
     wilting away in his anxiety. "If you will only give me something to
==>      do!" was his constant wail. At last Holmes could oblige him. <==

     "He has begun to pawn the jewels. We should get him now."

     "But does this mean that any harm has befallen the Lady Frances?"

     "He has begun to pawn the jewels. We should get him now."

     "But does this mean that any harm has befallen the Lady Frances?"

==>      Holmes shook his head very gravely. <==

     "Supposing that they have held her prisoner up to now, it is clear
     that they cannot let her loose without their own destruction. We must
     prepare for the worst."

     he rushed into our sitting-room, pale, trembling, with every muscle
     of his powerful frame quivering with excitement.

     "We have him! We have him!" he cried.

==>      He was incoherent in his agitation. Holmes soothed him with a few <==
     words and thrust him into an armchair.

     "Come, now, give us the order of events," said he.

     "She came only an hour ago. It was the wife, this time, but the

     "She came only an hour ago. It was the wife, this time, but the
     pendant she brought was the fellow of the other. She is a tall, pale
     woman, with ferret eyes."

==>      "That is the lady," said Holmes. <==

     "She left the office and I followed her. She walked up the Kennington
     Road, and I kept behind her. Presently she went into a shop. Mr.
     Holmes, it was an undertaker's."

     My companion started. "Well?" he asked in that vibrant voice which
     told of the fiery soul behind the cold gray face.

     "The windows were all in darkness save one on the lower floor. The
     blind was down, and I could not see in. I was standing there,
     wondering what I should do next, when a covered van drove up with two
     men in it. They descended, took something out of the van, and carried
==>      it up the steps to the hall door. Mr. Holmes, it was a coffin." <==

     "Ah!"

     "For an instant I was on the point of rushing in. The door had been
     opened to admit the men and their burden. It was the woman who had

     opened to admit the men and their burden. It was the woman who had
     opened it. But as I stood there she caught a glimpse of me, and I
     think that she recognized me. I saw her start, and she hastily closed
     the door. I remembered my promise to you, and here I am."

==>      "You have done excellent work," said Holmes, scribbling a few words <==
     upon a half-sheet of paper. "We can do nothing legal without a
     warrant, and you can serve the cause best by taking this note down to
     the authorities and getting one. There may be some difficulty, but I
     should think that the sale of the jewellery should be sufficient.
     Lestrade will see to all details."

     she. "My husband is not afraid to face any man in the world." She

     right side of the hall, turning up the gas as she left us. "Mr.

     "That will do; we have no time to waste," said my companion firmly.
     "You are Henry Peters, of Adelaide, late the Rev. Dr. Shlessinger, of
     Baden and South America. I am as sure of that as that my own name is

     Peters, as I will now call him, started and stared hard at his

     pendants that the dealer would hardly look at. She attached herself
     to Mrs. Peters and me at Baden--it is a fact that I was using another
     name at the time--and she stuck on to us until we came to London. I

     Our opponent opened the door.

     skirts down the passage, and the hall door was opened and shut.

     Peters, you will most certainly get hurt. Where is that coffin which
     was brought into your house?"

     "What do you want with the coffin? It is in use. There is a body in

     immediately before us. We entered. It was the dining-room. On the
     table, under a half-lit chandelier, the coffin was lying. Holmes

     turned up the gas and raised the lid. Deep down in the recesses of
     the coffin lay an emaciated figure. The glare from the lights above
     beat down upon an aged and withered face. By no possible process of
     cruelty, starvation, or disease could this wornout wreck be the still
     beautiful Lady Frances. Holmes's face showed his amazement, and also

     died--certificate says senile decay--but that's only the doctor's
     opinion, and of course you know better. We ordered her funeral to be

==>      Holmes's expression was as impassive as ever under the jeers of his <==

     "I am going through your house," said he.

     "Are you, though!" cried Peters as a woman's voice and heavy steps

     "Are you, though!" cried Peters as a woman's voice and heavy steps
     sounded in the passage. "We'll soon see about that. This way,
     officers, if you please. These men have forced their way into my
     house, and I cannot get rid of them. Help me to put them out."

==>      A sergeant and a constable stood in the doorway. Holmes drew his card <==
     from his case.

     "This is my name and address. This is my friend, Dr. Watson."

     "Bless you, sir, we know you very well," said the sergeant, "but you

     "Of course not. I quite understand that."

     "Arrest him!" cried Peters.

     "We know where to lay our hands on this gentleman if he is wanted,"

     "Yes, Watson, we shall have to go."

     followed us.

==>      "Sorry, Mr. Holmes, but that's the law." <==

     "Exactly, Sergeant, you could not do otherwise."

     "I expect there was good reason for your presence there. If there is
     anything I can do--"

     "It's a missing lady, Sergeant, and we think she is in that house. I
     expect a warrant presently."

==>      "Then I'll keep my eye on the parties, Mr. Holmes. If anything comes <==
     along, I will surely let you know."

     It was only nine o'clock, and we were off full cry upon the trail at
     once. First we drove to Brixton Workhoused Infirmary, where we found
     that it was indeed the truth that a charitable couple had called some

     should have no servant. So far and no further went the doctor.

     Finally we found our way to Scotland Yard. There had been
     difficulties of procedure in regard to the warrant. Some delay was
     inevitable. The magistrate's signature might not be obtained until
==>      next morning. If Holmes would call about nine he could go down with <==
     Lestrade and see it acted upon. So ended the day, save that near
     midnight our friend, the sergeant, called to say that he had seen
     flickering lights here and there in the windows of the great dark
     house, but that no one had left it and none had entered. We could but
     pray for patience and wait for the morrow.

==>      Sherlock Holmes was too irritable for conversation and too restless <==
     for sleep. I left him smoking hard, with his heavy, dark brows
     knotted together, and his long, nervous fingers tapping upon the arms
     of his chair, as he turned over in his mind every possible solution
     of the mystery. Several times in the course of the night I heard him
     prowling about the house. Finally, just after I had been called in

[line number in individual story] matching line = 794    window = 789 799

     Baker Street. But even so it was twenty-five to eight as we passed
     Big Ben, and eight struck as we tore down the Brixton Road. But
     others were late as well as we. Ten minutes after the hour the hearse
     was still standing at the door of the house, and even as our foaming
     horse came to a halt the coffin, supported by three men, appeared on
==>      the threshold. Holmes darted forward and barred their way. <==

     "Take it back!" he cried, laying his hand on the breast of the
     foremost. "Take it back this instant!"

     "What the devil do you mean? Once again I ask you, where is your

     the farther end of the coffin.

     "The warrant is on its way. The coffin shall remain in the house
     until it comes."

==>      The authority in Holmes's voice had its effect upon the bearers. <==
     Peters had suddenly vanished into the house, and they obeyed these
     new orders. "Quick, Watson, quick! Here is a screw-driver!" he
     shouted as the coffin was replaced upon the table. "Here's one for
     you, my man! A sovreign if the lid comes off in a minute! Ask no
     questions--work away! That's good! Another! And another! Now pull all

     together! It's giving! It's giving! Ah, that does it at last."

     With a united effort we tore off the coffin-lid. As we did so there
     came from the inside a stupefying and overpowering smell of
     chloroform. A body lay within, its head all wreathed in cotton-wool,
==>      which had been soaked in the narcotic. Holmes plucked it off and <==
     disclosed the statuesque face of a handsome and spiritual woman of
     middle age. In an instant he had passed his arm round the figure and
     raised her to a sitting position.

     "Is she gone, Watson? Is there a spark left? Surely we are not too

     suffocation, and what with the poisonous fumes of the chloroform, the
     Lady Frances seemed to have passed the last point of recall. And
     then, at last, with artificial respiration, with injected ether, and
     with every device that science could suggest, some flutter of life,
     some quiver of the eyelids, some dimming of a mirror, spoke of the
==>      slowly returning life. A cab had driven up, and Holmes, parting the <==
     blind, looked out at it. "Here is Lestrade with his warrant," said
     he. "He will find that his birds have flown. And here," he added as a
     heavy step hurried along the passage, "is someone who has a better
     right to nurse this lady than we have. Good morning, Mr. Green; I
     think that the sooner we can move the Lady Frances the better.

     think that the sooner we can move the Lady Frances the better.
     Meanwhile, the funeral may proceed, and the poor old woman who still
     lies in that coffin may go to her last resting-place alone."

     "Should you care to add the case to your annals, my dear Watson,"
==>      said Holmes that evening, "it can only be as an example of that <==
     temporary eclipse to which even the best-balanced mind may be
     exposed. Such slips are common to all mortals, and the greatest is he
     who can recognize and repair them. To this modified credit I may,
     perhaps, make some claim. My night was haunted by the thought that

     "By the way, Holmes," I added, "I have no doubt the connection
     between my boots and a Turkish bath is a perfectly self-evident one
     to a logical mind, and yet I should be obliged to you if you would
     indicate it."

==>      "The train of reasoning is not very obscure, Watson," said Holmes <==
     with a mischievous twinkle. "It belongs to the same elementary class
     of deduction which I should illustrate if I were to ask you who
     shared your cab in your drive this morning."

     "I don't admit that a fresh illustration is an explanation," said I

     "I don't admit that a fresh illustration is an explanation," said I
     with some asperity.

     see, what were the points? Take the last one first--the cab. You
     observe that you have some splashes on the left sleeve and shoulder
     of your coat. Had you sat in the centre of a hansom you would
     probably have had no splashes, and if you had they would certainly
     have been symmetrical. Therefore it is clear that you sat at the

     "What is that?"

     wealthy no sum will be spared if we can clear the matter up."

     "Is Miss Dobney the only source of information? Surely she had other
     correspondents?"

     bank. Single ladies must live, and their passbooks are compressed
     diaries. She banks at Silvester's. I have glanced over her account.
     The last check but one paid her bill at Lausanne, but it was a large
     one and probably left her with cash in hand. Only one check has been
     drawn since."

     "Hence the health-giving expedition to Lausanne. You know that I
     cannot possibly leave London while old Abrahams is in such mortal
     terror of his life. Besides, on general principles it is best that I
     should not leave the country. Scotland Yard feels lonely without me,
     and it causes an unhealthy excitement among the criminal classes. Go,

     so extravagant a rate as two pence a word, it waits your disposal
     night and day at the end of the Continental wire."

     Two days later found me at the Hotel National at Lausanne, where I
     received every courtesy at the hands of M. Moser, the well-known

     hold. He stood for an instant fuming with rage and uncertain whether
     he should not renew his attack. Then, with a snarl of anger, he left
     me and entered the cottage from which I had just come. I turned to
     thank my preserver, who stood beside me in the roadway.

     rather think you had better come back with me to London by the night

     could get away from London, he determined to head me off at the next
     obvious point of my travels. In the disguise of a workingman he had
     sat in the cabaret waiting for my appearance.

     "And a singularly consistent investigation you have made, my dear
==>      Watson," said he. "I cannot at the moment recall any possible blunder <==
     which you have omitted. The total effect of your proceeding has been
     to give the alarm everywhere and yet to discover nothing."

     "Perhaps you would have done no better," I answered bitterly.

     saw me.

     "What is this, Mr. Holmes?" he asked. "I had your note and I have
     come. But what has this man to do with the matter?"

==>      "This is my old friend and associate, Dr. Watson, who is helping us <==

     The stranger held out a huge, sunburned hand, with a few words of

     my money at Barberton I thought perhaps I could seek her out and
     soften her. I had heard that she was still unmarried, I found her at
     Lausanne and tried all I knew. She weakened, I think, but her will
     was strong, and when next I called she had left the town. I traced
     her to Baden, and then after a time heard that her maid was here. I'm

     "That is for us to find out," said Sherlock Holmes with peculiar
     gravity. "What is your London address, Mr. Green?"

     "Then may I recommend that you return there and be on hand in case I
     should want you? I have no desire to encourage false hopes, but you
     may rest assured that all that can be done will be done for the
     safety of Lady Frances. I can say no more for the instant. I will
     leave you this card so that you may be able to keep in touch with us.

     make one of her best efforts for two hungry travellers at 7.30
     to-morrow."

     A telegram was awaiting us when we reached our Baker Street rooms,
     which Holmes read with an exclamation of interest and threw across to

     "Exactly. For this reason I sent a duplicate to the manager of the
     Englischer Hof, whose answer lies here."

     "What does it show?"

==>      "It shows, my dear Watson, that we are dealing with an exceptionally <==
     astute and dangerous man. The Rev. Dr. Shlessinger, missionary from
     South America, is none other than Holy Peters, one of the most
     unscrupulous rascals that Australia has ever evolved--and for a young
     country it has turned out some very finished types. His particular
     specialty is the beguiling of lonely ladies by playing upon their

     religious feelings, and his so-called wife, an Englishwoman named
     Fraser, is a worthy helpmate. The nature of his tactics suggested his
     identity to me, and this physical peculiarity--he was badly bitten in
     a saloon-fight at Adelaide in '89--confirmed my suspicion. This poor
     lady is in the hands of a most infernal couple, who will stick at
==>      nothing, Watson. That she is already dead is a very likely <==
     supposition. If not, she is undoubtedly in some sort of confinement
     and unable to write to Miss Dobney or her other friends. It is always
     possible that she never reached London, or that she has passed
     through it, but the former is improbable, as, with their system of
     registration, it is not easy for foreigners to play tricks with the

     mean, and for whom could it be but for her?"

     "We will do all that can be done, Mr. Green. Not a moment will be

     hurried away, "he will set the regular forces on the move. We are, as
     usual, the irregulars, and we must take our own line of action. The
     situation strikes me as so desperate that the most extreme measures
     are justified. Not a moment is to be lost in getting to Poultney
     Square.

     forever. So murder is their only solution."

     "That seems very clear."

     "Now we will take another line of reasoning. When you follow two
==>      separate chains of thought, Watson, you will find some point of <==
     intersection which should approximate to the truth. We will start
     now, not from the lady but from the coffin and argue backward. That
     incident proves, I fear, beyond all doubt that the lady is dead. It
     points also to an orthodox burial with proper accompaniment of
     medical certificate and official sanction. Had the lady been

     strange that they should ever let a doctor approach her unless he
     were a confederate, which is hardly a credible proposition."

     "Could they have forged a medical certificate?"

==>      "Dangerous, Watson, very dangerous. No, I hardly see them doing that. <==
     Pull up, cabby! This is evidently the undertaker's, for we have just
     passed the pawnbroker's. Would go in, Watson? Your appearance
     inspires confidence. Ask what hour the Poultney Square funeral takes
     place to-morrow."

     The woman in the shop answered me without hesitation that it was to
     be at eight o'clock in the morning. "You see, Watson, no mystery;

     everything above-board! In some way the legal forms have undoubtedly
     been complied with, and they think that they have little to fear.
     Well, there's nothing for it now but a direct frontal attack. Are you
     armed?"

     "My stick!"

     "Well, well, we shall be strong enough. 'Thrice is he armed who hath
     his quarrel just.' We simply can't afford to wait for the police or
     to keep within the four corners of the law. You can drive off, cabby.
==>      Now, Watson, we'll just take our luck together, as we have <==
     occasionally in the past."

     He had rung loudly at the door of a great dark house in the centre of
     Poultney Square. It was opened immediately, and the figure of a tall
     woman was outlined against the dim-lit hall.

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 63832    window = 63827 63837


     Our opponent opened the door.

     "Fetch a policeman, Annie!" said he. There was a whisk of feminine
     skirts down the passage, and the hall door was opened and shut.

==>      "Our time is limited, Watson," said Holmes. "If you try to stop us, <==
     Peters, you will most certainly get hurt. Where is that coffin which
     was brought into your house?"

     "What do you want with the coffin? It is in use. There is a body in
     it."

     house, and I cannot get rid of them. Help me to put them out."

     A sergeant and a constable stood in the doorway. Holmes drew his card
     from his case.

==>      "This is my name and address. This is my friend, Dr. Watson." <==

     "Bless you, sir, we know you very well," said the sergeant, "but you
     can't stay here without a warrant."

     "Of course not. I quite understand that."

     said the sergeant majestically, "but you'll have to go, Mr. Holmes."

==>      "Yes, Watson, we shall have to go." <==

     A minute later we were in the street once more. Holmes was as cool as
     ever, but I was hot with anger and humiliation. The sergeant had
     followed us.

     the morning, he rushed into my room. He was in his dressing-gown, but
     his pale, hollow-eyed face told me that his night had been a
     sleepless one.

     "What time was the funeral? Eight, was it not?" he asked eagerly.
==>      "Well, it is 7.20 now. Good heavens, Watson, what has become of any <==
     brains that God has given me? Quick, man, quick! It's life or
     death--a hundred chances on death to one on life. I'll never forgive
     myself, never, if we are too late!"

     Five minutes had not passed before we were flying in a hansom down

     "The warrant is on its way. The coffin shall remain in the house
     until it comes."

     The authority in Holmes's voice had its effect upon the bearers.
     Peters had suddenly vanished into the house, and they obeyed these
==>      new orders. "Quick, Watson, quick! Here is a screw-driver!" he <==
     shouted as the coffin was replaced upon the table. "Here's one for
     you, my man! A sovreign if the lid comes off in a minute! Ask no
     questions--work away! That's good! Another! And another! Now pull all
     together! It's giving! It's giving! Ah, that does it at last."

     which had been soaked in the narcotic. Holmes plucked it off and
     disclosed the statuesque face of a handsome and spiritual woman of
     middle age. In an instant he had passed his arm round the figure and
     raised her to a sitting position.

==>      "Is she gone, Watson? Is there a spark left? Surely we are not too <==
     late!"

     For half an hour it seemed that we were. What with actual
     suffocation, and what with the poisonous fumes of the chloroform, the
     Lady Frances seemed to have passed the last point of recall. And

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 64012    window = 64007 64017


     right to nurse this lady than we have. Good morning, Mr. Green; I
     think that the sooner we can move the Lady Frances the better.
     Meanwhile, the funeral may proceed, and the poor old woman who still
     lies in that coffin may go to her last resting-place alone."

==>      "Should you care to add the case to your annals, my dear Watson," <==
     said Holmes that evening, "it can only be as an example of that
     temporary eclipse to which even the best-balanced mind may be
     exposed. Such slips are common to all mortals, and the greatest is he
     who can recognize and repair them. To this modified credit I may,
     perhaps, make some claim. My night was haunted by the thought that

     such considerations might prevail with them. You can reconstruct the
     scene well enough. You saw the horrible den upstairs, where the poor
     lady had been kept so long. They rushed in and overpowered her with
     their chloroform, carried her down, poured more into the coffin to
     insure against her waking, and then screwed down the lid. A clever
==>      device, Watson. It is new to me in the annals of crime. If our <==
     ex-missionary friends escape the clutches of Lestrade, I shall expect
     to hear of some brilliant incidents in their future career."

     could not hope to find any other place where it would be as easy to
     keep a person under restraint. All my instincts tell me that she is
     in London, but as we have at present no possible means of telling
     where, we can only take the obvious steps, eat our dinner, and
     possess our souls in patience. Later in the evening I will stroll
==>      down and have a word with friend Lestrade at Scotland Yard." <==

     But neither the official police nor Holmes's own small but very
     efficient organization sufficed to clear away the mystery. Amid the
     crowded millions of London the three persons we sought were as
     completely obliterated as if they had never lived. Advertisements

     "You have done excellent work," said Holmes, scribbling a few words
     upon a half-sheet of paper. "We can do nothing legal without a
     warrant, and you can serve the cause best by taking this note down to
     the authorities and getting one. There may be some difficulty, but I
     should think that the sale of the jewellery should be sufficient.

     Finally we found our way to Scotland Yard. There had been
     difficulties of procedure in regard to the warrant. Some delay was
     inevitable. The magistrate's signature might not be obtained until
     next morning. If Holmes would call about nine he could go down with

     midnight our friend, the sergeant, called to say that he had seen
     flickering lights here and there in the windows of the great dark
     house, but that no one had left it and none had entered. We could but
     pray for patience and wait for the morrow.

     Lady Frances seemed to have passed the last point of recall. And
     then, at last, with artificial respiration, with injected ether, and
     with every device that science could suggest, some flutter of life,
     some quiver of the eyelids, some dimming of a mirror, spoke of the
