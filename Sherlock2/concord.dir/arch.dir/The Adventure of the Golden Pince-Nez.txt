     turn over the pages I see my notes upon the repulsive story of the
     red leech and the terrible death of Crosby the banker. Here also I
     find an account of the Addleton tragedy and the singular contents of
     the ancient British barrow. The famous Smith-Mortimer succession case
     comes also within this period, and so does the tracking and arrest of
==>      Huret, the Boulevard assassin--an exploit which won for Holmes an <==
     autograph letter of thanks from the French President and the Order of
     the Legion of Honour. Each of these would furnish a narrative, but on
     the whole I am of opinion that none of them unite so many singular
     points of interest as the episode of Yoxley Old Place, which includes
     not only the lamentable death of young Willoughby Smith, but also

     not only the lamentable death of young Willoughby Smith, but also
     those subsequent developments which threw so curious a light upon the
     causes of the crime.

     It was a wild, tempestuous night towards the close of November.
==>      Holmes and I sat together in silence all the evening, he engaged with <==
     a powerful lens deciphering the remains of the original inscription
     upon a palimpsest, I deep in a recent treatise upon surgery. Outside
     the wind howled down Baker Street, while the rain beat fiercely
     against the windows. It was strange there in the very depths of the
     town, with ten miles of man's handiwork on every side of us, to feel

     street. The occasional lamps gleamed on the expanse of muddy road and
     shining pavement. A single cab was splashing its way from the Oxford
     Street end.

     "Well, Watson, it's as well we have not to turn out to-night," said
==>      Holmes, laying aside his lens and rolling up the palimpsest. "I've <==
     done enough for one sitting. It is trying work for the eyes. So far
     as I can make out it is nothing more exciting than an Abbey's
     accounts dating from the second half of the fifteenth century.
     Halloa! halloa! halloa! What's this?"

     dear fellow, and open the door, for all virtuous folk have been long
     in bed."

     When the light of the hall lamp fell upon our midnight visitor I had
     no difficulty in recognising him. It was young Stanley Hopkins, a
==>      promising detective, in whose career Holmes had several times shown a <==
     very practical interest.

     "Is he in?" he asked, eagerly.

     "Come up, my dear sir," said Holmes's voice from above. "I hope you

     have no designs upon us on such a night as this."

     The detective mounted the stairs, and our lamp gleamed upon his
     shining waterproof. I helped him out of it while Holmes knocked a
     blaze out of the logs in the grate.

     something important which has brought you out in such a gale."

==>      "It is indeed, Mr. Holmes. I've had a bustling afternoon, I promise <==
     you. Did you see anything of the Yoxley case in the latest editions?"

     "I've seen nothing later than the fifteenth century to-day."

     "It means that I can make neither head nor tail of it. So far as I
     can see it is just as tangled a business as ever I handled, and yet
     at first it seemed so simple that one couldn't go wrong. There's no

     motive. Here's a man dead--there's no denying that--but, so far as I
     can see, no reason on earth why anyone should wish him harm."

     Holmes lit his cigar and leaned back in his chair.

     "I've got my facts pretty clear," said Stanley Hopkins. "All I want
     now is to know what they all mean. The story, so far as I can make it

     first he was a decent, quiet, hardworking fellow, with no weak spot
     in him at all. And yet this is the lad who has met his death this
     morning in the Professor's study under circumstances which can point
     only to murder."

==>      The wind howled and screamed at the windows. Holmes and I drew closer <==
     to the fire while the young inspector slowly and point by point
     developed his singular narrative.

     "If you were to search all England," said he, "I don't suppose you
     could find a household more self-contained or free from outside

     send Mortimer the gardener for the local police. A little later the
     chief constable sent for me. Nothing was moved before I got there,
     and strict orders were given that no one should walk upon the paths
     leading to the house. It was a splendid chance of putting your

     "Except Mr. Sherlock Holmes," said my companion, with a somewhat

     make of it?"

     He unfolded the rough chart, which I here reproduce, and he laid it

     it over his shoulder.

     a distinct impression, but the grass was trodden down and someone had
     undoubtedly passed. It could only have been the murderer, since
     neither the gardener nor anyone else had been there that morning and
     the rain had only begun during the night."

==>      "One moment," said Holmes. "Where does this path lead to?" <==

     "To the road."

     "How long is it?"

     "A large foot or a small?"

     "You could not distinguish."

==>      Holmes gave an ejaculation of impatience. <==

     "It has been pouring rain and blowing a hurricane ever since," said
     he. "It will be harder to read now than that palimpsest. Well, well,
     it can't be helped. What did you do, Hopkins, after you had made
     certain that you had made certain of nothing?"

     "It has been pouring rain and blowing a hurricane ever since," said
     he. "It will be harder to read now than that palimpsest. Well, well,
     it can't be helped. What did you do, Hopkins, after you had made
     certain that you had made certain of nothing?"

==>      "I think I made certain of a good deal, Mr. Holmes. I knew that <==
     someone had entered the house cautiously from without. I next
     examined the corridor. It is lined with cocoanut matting and had
     taken no impression of any kind. This brought me into the study
     itself. It is a scantily-furnished room. The main article is a large
     writing-table with a fixed bureau. This bureau consists of a double

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 40476    window = 40471 40481


     "I come now to the body of the young man. It was found near the
     bureau, and just to the left of it, as marked upon that chart. The
     stab was on the right side of the neck and from behind forwards, so
     that it is almost impossible that it could have been self-inflicted."

==>      "Unless he fell upon the knife," said Holmes. <==

     "Exactly. The idea crossed my mind. But we found the knife some feet
     away from the body, so that seems impossible. Then, of course, there
     are the man's own dying words. And, finally, there was this very
     important piece of evidence which was found clasped in the dead man's

     unfolded it and disclosed a golden pince-nez, with two broken ends of
     black silk cord dangling from the end of it. "Willoughby Smith had
     excellent sight," he added. "There can be no question that this was
     snatched from the face or the person of the assassin."

==>      Sherlock Holmes took the glasses into his hand and examined them with <==
     the utmost attention and interest. He held them on his nose,
     endeavoured to read through them, went to the window and stared up
     the street with them, looked at them most minutely in the full light
     of the lamp, and finally, with a chuckle, seated himself at the table
     and wrote a few lines upon a sheet of paper, which he tossed across

[line number in individual story] matching line = 322    window = 317 327

     probably rounded shoulders. There are indications that she has had
     recourse to an optician at least twice during the last few months. As
     her glasses are of remarkable strength and as opticians are not very
     numerous, there should be no difficulty in tracing her."

==>      Holmes smiled at the astonishment of Hopkins, which must have been <==
     reflected upon my features.

     "Surely my deductions are simplicity itself," said he. "It would be
     difficult to name any articles which afford a finer field for
     inference than a pair of glasses, especially so remarkable a pair as

     "Yes," I said, "I can follow each of your arguments. I confess,
     however, that I am unable to understand how you arrive at the double
     visit to the optician."

==>      Holmes took the glasses in his hand. <==

     "You will perceive," he said, "that the clips are lined with tiny
     bands of cork to soften the pressure upon the nose. One of these is
     discoloured and worn to some slight extent, but the other is new.
     Evidently one has fallen off and been replaced. I should judge that

     opticians."

     "Of course you would. Meanwhile, have you anything more to tell us
     about the case?"

==>      "Nothing, Mr. Holmes. I think that you know as much as I do <==
     now--probably more. We have had inquiries made as to any stranger
     seen on the country roads or at the railway station. We have heard of
     none. What beats me is the utter want of all object in the crime. Not
     a ghost of a motive can anyone suggest."

     a ghost of a motive can anyone suggest."

     "Ah! there I am not in a position to help you. But I suppose you want
     us to come out to-morrow?"

==>      "If it is not asking too much, Mr. Holmes. There's a train from <==
     Charing Cross to Chatham at six in the morning, and we should be at
     Yoxley Old Place between eight and nine."

     "Then we shall take it. Your case has certainly some features of
     great interest, and I shall be delighted to look into it. Well, it's

     "Yes, sir; there is no one that we cannot account for."

     "Well, it's only a reasonable walk to Chatham. Anyone might stay
     there, or take a train without being observed. This is the garden

     mark on it yesterday."

     "On which side were the marks on the grass?"

     "This side, sir. This narrow margin of grass between the path and the

     "This side, sir. This narrow margin of grass between the path and the
     flower-bed. I can't see the traces now, but they were clear to me
     then."

==>      "Yes, yes; someone has passed along," said Holmes, stooping over the <==
     grass border. "Our lady must have picked her steps carefully, must
     she not, since on the one side she would leave a track on the path,
     and on the other an even clearer one on the soft bed?"

     "Yes, sir, she must have been a cool hand."

     "Yes, sir, she must have been a cool hand."

     "Hum! It was a very remarkable performance--very remarkable. Well, I
     think we have exhausted the path. Let us go farther. This garden door
     is usually kept open, I suppose? Then this visitor had nothing to do

     The mark which he was examining began upon the brass work on the

     where it had scratched the varnish from the surface.

     "This is recent, quite recent. See how the brass shines where it is

     you are a man of action--you are a man of affairs. It is part of the

     Professor was talking. I observed that he was smoking with
     extraordinary rapidity. It was evident that he shared our host's
     liking for the fresh Alexandrian cigarettes.

     "I am a connoisseur," said he, taking another cigarette from the
     box--his fourth--and lighting it from the stub of that which he had
     finished. "I will not trouble you with any lengthy cross-examination,
     Professor Coram, since I gather that you were in bed at the time of

     on such a point. As to the knife, it might well be thrown far from
     the unfortunate man as he fell. It is possible that I speak as a
     child, but to me it seems that Willoughby Smith has met his fate by
     his own hand."

==>      Holmes seemed struck by the theory thus put forward, and he continued <==
     to walk up and down for some time, lost in thought and consuming
     cigarette after cigarette.

     "Tell me, Professor Coram," he said, at last, "what is in that
     cupboard in the bureau?"

     "Nothing that would help a thief. Family papers, letters from my poor
     wife, diplomas of Universities which have done me honour. Here is the
     key. You can look for yourself."

==>      Holmes picked up the key and looked at it for an instant; then he <==
     handed it back.

     "No; I hardly think that it would help me," said he. "I should prefer
     to go quietly down to your garden and turn the whole matter over in
     my head. There is something to be said for the theory of suicide

     which you have put forward. We must apologize for having intruded
     upon you, Professor Coram, and I promise that we won't disturb you
     until after lunch. At two o'clock we will come again and report to
     you anything which may have happened in the interval."

==>      Holmes was curiously distrait, and we walked up and down the garden <==
     path for some time in silence.

     "Have you a clue?" I asked, at last.

     "It depends upon those cigarettes that I smoked," said he. "It is

     "Have you a clue?" I asked, at last.

     "It depends upon those cigarettes that I smoked," said he. "It is
     possible that I am utterly mistaken. The cigarettes will show me."

==>      "My dear Holmes," I exclaimed, "how on earth--" <==

     "Well, well, you may see for yourself. If not, there's no harm done.
     Of course, we always have the optician clue to fall back upon, but I
     take a short cut when I can get it. Ah, here is the good Mrs. Marker!

     peculiarly ingratiating way with women, and that he very readily
     established terms of confidence with them. In half the time which he
     had named he had captured the housekeeper's goodwill, and was

     into the general scheme which he had formed in his brain. Suddenly he
     sprang from his chair and glanced at his watch. "Two o'clock,

     corner of the room.

     with, in addition, a long and obstinate chin. What with her natural
     blindness, and what with the change from dark to light, she stood as
     one dazed, blinking about her to see where and who we were. And yet,
     in spite of all these disadvantages, there was a certain nobility in
     the woman's bearing, a gallantry in the defiant chin and in the

     She had turned a dreadful colour, the more ghastly under the dark

     nose is usually a short and coarse one, but there are a sufficient

     This, then, might be the door. I could see no marks to guide me, but
