     "That means a case, I suppose?"

     "Yes, sir, he is very hard at it just now. I'm frightened for his
     health. He gets paler and thinner, and he eats nothing. 'When will
==>      you be pleased to dine, Mr. Holmes?' Mrs. Hudson asked. <==
     'Seven-thirty, the day after to-morrow,' said he. You know his way
     when he is keen on a case."

     "Yes, Billy, I know."

     "What--the hundred-thousand-pound burglary?"

     "Yes, sir. They must get it back, sir. Why, we had the Prime Minister

     very nice to them. He soon put them at their ease and promised he
     would do all he could. Then there is Lord Cantlemere--"

     "Ah!"

     "Yes, sir, you know what that means. He's a stiff 'un, sir, if I may
     say so. I can get along with the Prime Minister, and I've nothing
     against the Home Secretary, who seemed a civil, obliging sort of man,

     he don't believe in Mr. Holmes and he was against employing him. He'd

     Billy advanced and drew away the drapery which screened the alcove of
     the bow window.

     looked out into the street. "There are folk who watch us from over

     yourself."

     Watson had taken a step forward when the bedroom door opened, and the
==>      long, thin form of Holmes emerged, his face pale and drawn, but his <==
     step and bearing as active as ever. With a single spring he was at
     the window, and had drawn the blind once more.

     "That will do, Billy," said he. "You were in danger of your life
     then, my boy, and I can't do without you just yet. Well, Watson, it

     "So I gather."

     "You can go, Billy. That boy is a problem, Watson. How far am I
     justified in allowing him to be in danger?"

==>      "Danger of what, Holmes?" <==

     "Of sudden death. I'm expecting something this evening."

     "Expecting what?"

     "Even my limited sense of humour could evolve a better joke than
     that. But we may be comfortable in the meantime, may we not? Is
     alcohol permitted? The gasogene and cigars are in the old place. Let
     me see you once more in the customary armchair. You have not, I hope,

     surely, as a doctor, my dear Watson, you must admit that what your
     digestion gains in the way of blood supply is so much lost to the
     brain. I am a brain, Watson. The rest of me is a mere appendix.
     Therefore, it is the brain I must consider."

==>      "But this danger, Holmes?" <==

     "Ah, yes, in case it should come off, it would perhaps be as well
     that you should burden your memory with the name and address of the
     murderer. You can give it to Scotland Yard, with my love and a
     parting blessing. Sylvius is the name--Count Negretto Sylvius. Write

     Watson's honest face was twitching with anxiety. He knew only too
==>      well the immense risks taken by Holmes and was well aware that what <==
     he said was more likely to be under-statement than exaggeration.
     Watson was always the man of action, and he rose to the occasion.

     "Count me in, Holmes. I have nothing to do for a day or two."

     on him every hour."

     Billy showed it to you. Well, it may get a bullet through its
     beautiful head at any moment. Ah, Billy, what is it?"

==>      The boy had reappeared in the room with a card upon a tray. Holmes <==
     glanced at it with raised eyebrows and an amused smile.

     "The man himself. I had hardly expected this. Grasp the nettle,
     Watson! A man of nerve. Possibly you have heard of his reputation as
     a shooter of big game. It would indeed be a triumphant ending to his

     "Yes, sir."

     Watson waited until the door was closed, and then he turned earnestly
     to his companion.

==>      "Look here, Holmes, this is simply impossible. This is a desperate <==
     man, who sticks at nothing. He may have come to murder you."

     "I should not be surprised."

     "I insist upon staying with you."

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 68077    window = 68072 68082



     "Well, I can't possibly leave you."

     "Yes, you can, Watson. And you will, for you have never failed to
     play the game. I am sure you will play it to the end. This man has
==>      come for his own purpose, but he may stay for mine." Holmes took out <==
     his notebook and scribbled a few lines. "Take a cab to Scotland Yard
     and give this to Youghal of the C. I. D. Come back with the police.
     The fellow's arrest will follow."

     "I'll do that with joy."

     instant he half raised his loaded cane once more, as if he would turn
     his violence from the effigy to the original; but there was something
     in that steady gray eye and mocking smile which caused his hand to
     sink to his side.

==>      "It's a pretty little thing," said Holmes, advancing towards the <==
     image. "Tavernier, the French modeller, made it. He is as good at
     waxworks as your friend Straubenzee is at air-guns."

     "Air-guns, sir! What do you mean?"

     you prefer to sit upon it. Your visit is really most opportune, for I
     wanted badly to have a few minutes' chat with you."

     The Count scowled, with heavy, threatening eyebrows.

==>      "I, too, wished to have some words with you, Holmes. That is why I am <==
     here. I won't deny that I intended to assault you just now."

     Holmes swung his leg on the edge of the table.

     "I rather gathered that you had some idea of the sort in your head,"

==>      Holmes swung his leg on the edge of the table. <==

     "I rather gathered that you had some idea of the sort in your head,"
     said he. "But why these personal attentions?"

     "Because you have gone out of your way to annoy me. Because you have

     "My creatures! I assure you no!"

     "Nonsense! I have had them followed. Two can play at that game,

     "It is a small point, Count Sylvius, but perhaps you would kindly
     give me my prefix when you address me. You can understand that, with
     my routine of work, I should find myself on familiar terms with half

==>      "Well, Mr. Holmes, then." <==

     "Excellent! But I assure you you are mistaken about my alleged
     agents."

     Count Sylvius laughed contemptuously.

     "It was you--you yourself?"

     to suspect."

     "If I had known, you might never--"

     "You can, and you will."

     "Indeed!"

==>      "You can't bluff me, Count Sylvius." Holmes's eyes, as he gazed at <==
     him, contracted and lightened until they were like two menacing
     points of steel. "You are absolute plate-glass. I see to the very
     back of your mind."

     "Then, of course, you see where the diamond is!"

     points of steel. "You are absolute plate-glass. I see to the very
     back of your mind."

     "Then, of course, you see where the diamond is!"

     finger. "Then you do know. You have admitted it!"

     "I admit nothing."

     "Now, Count, if you will be reasonable we can do business. If not,

     you will get hurt."

     Count Sylvius threw up his eyes to the ceiling. "And you talk about
     bluff!" said he.

==>      Holmes looked at him thoughtfully like a master chess-player who <==
     meditates his crowning move. Then he threw open the table drawer and
     drew out a squat notebook.

     "Do you know what I keep in this book?"

     "Me!"

     "Yes, sir, you! You are all here--every action of your vile and
     dangerous life."

==>      "Damn you, Holmes!" cried the Count with blazing eyes. "There are <==
     limits to my patience!"

     "It's all here, Count. The real facts as to the death of old Mrs.
     Harold, who left you the Blymer estate, which you so rapidly gambled
     away."

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 68300    window = 68295 68305



     The veins stood out on the Count's forehead. His dark, hairy hands
     were clenched in a convulsion of restrained emotion. He tried to
     speak, but the words would not shape themselves.

==>      "That's the hand I play from," said Holmes. "I put it all upon the <==
     table. But one card is missing. It's the king of diamonds. I don't
     know where the stone is."

     "You never shall know."

     "My friend Watson was with me just now. I told him that I had a shark
     and a gudgeon in my net; now I am drawing the net and up they come
     together."

     The Count had risen from his chair, and his hand was behind his back.
==>      Holmes held something half protruding from the pocket of his <==
     dressing-gown.

     "You won't die in your bed, Holmes."

     "I have often had the same idea. Does it matter very much? After all,

     The Count had risen from his chair, and his hand was behind his back.
     Holmes held something half protruding from the pocket of his
     dressing-gown.

     "I have often had the same idea. Does it matter very much? After all,
     Count, your own exit is more likely to be perpendicular than
     horizontal. But these anticipations of the future are morbid. Why not
     give ourselves up to the unrestrained enjoyment of the present?"

     give ourselves up to the unrestrained enjoyment of the present?"

     A sudden wild-beast light sprang up in the dark, menacing eyes of the
==>      master criminal. Holmes's figure seemed to grow taller as he grew <==
     tense and ready.

     "It is no use your fingering your revolver, my friend," he said in a
     quiet voice. "You know perfectly well that you dare not use it, even
     if I gave you time to draw it. Nasty, noisy things, revolvers, Count.

     your estimable partner. Good day, Mr. Merton. Rather dull in the
     street, is it not?"

     The prize-fighter, a heavily built young man with a stupid,
     obstinate, slab-sided face, stood awkwardly at the door, looking
==>      about him with a puzzled expression. Holmes's debonair manner was a <==
     new experience, and though he vaguely felt that it was hostile, he
     did not know how to counter it. He turned to his more astute comrade
     for help.

     "What's the game now, Count? What's this fellow want? What's up?" His

     for help.

     "What's the game now, Count? What's this fellow want? What's up?" His
     voice was deep and raucous.

==>      The Count shrugged his shoulders, and it was Holmes who answered. <==

     "If I may put it in a nutshell, Mr. Merton, I should say it was all
     up."

     The boxer still addressed his remarks to his associate.

[line number in individual story] matching line = 546    window = 541 551

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 68379    window = 68374 68384


     The boxer still addressed his remarks to his associate.

     "Is this cove trying to be funny, or what? I'm not in the funny mood
     myself."

==>      "No, I expect not," said Holmes. "I think I can promise you that you <==
     will feel even less humorous as the evening advances. Now, look here,
     Count Sylvius. I'm a busy man and I can't waste time. I'm going into
     that bedroom. Pray make yourselves quite at home in my absence. You
     can explain to your friend how the matter lies without the restraint
     of my presence. I shall try over the Hoffman 'Barcarole' upon my

     of my presence. I shall try over the Hoffman 'Barcarole' upon my
     violin. In five minutes I shall return for your final answer. You
     quite grasp the alternative, do you not? Shall we take you, or shall
     we have the stone?"

==>      Holmes withdrew, picking up his violin from the corner as he passed. <==
     A few moments later the long-drawn, wailing notes of that most
     haunting of tunes came faintly through the closed door of the
     bedroom.

     "What is it, then?" asked Merton anxiously as his companion turned to

     "Well, he must take it as it is and chance it. There's not a moment
     to lose." Again, with the sense of danger which becomes an instinct
     with the sportsman, he paused and looked hard at the window. Yes, it
     was surely from the street that the faint sound had come.

==>      "As to Holmes," he continued, "we can fool him easily enough. You <==
     see, the damned fool won't arrest us if he can get the stone. Well,
     we'll promise him the stone. We'll put him on the wrong track about
     it, and before he finds that it is the wrong track it will be in
     Holland and we out of the country."

     "Thank you!"

     grasped the precious jewel. He held it now in one hand, while his
     other pointed a revolver at the Count's head. The two villains
     staggered back in utter amazement. Before they had recovered Holmes
     had pressed the electric bell.

     "No violence, gentlemen--no violence, I beg of you! Consider the

     impossible one. The police are waiting below."

     presence."

     The Count gave a gesture of resignation.

     "Not far from him, at any rate," Holmes answered with a polite smile.

     Sam Merton's slow intellect had only gradually appreciated the
     situation. Now, as the sound of heavy steps came from the stairs

     The Count gave a gesture of resignation.

     "We give you best, Holmes. I believe you are the devil himself."

==>      "Not far from him, at any rate," Holmes answered with a polite smile. <==

     Sam Merton's slow intellect had only gradually appreciated the
     situation. Now, as the sound of heavy steps came from the stairs
     outside, he broke silence at last.

     outside, he broke silence at last.

     "A fair cop!" said he. "But, I say, what about that bloomin' fiddle!
     I hear it yet."

==>      "Tut, tut!" Holmes answered. "You are perfectly right. Let it play! <==
     These modern gramophones are a remarkable invention."

     There was an inrush of police, the handcuffs clicked and the
     criminals were led to the waiting cab. Watson lingered with Holmes,
     congratulating him upon this fresh leaf added to his laurels. Once

     There was an inrush of police, the handcuffs clicked and the

     congratulating him upon this fresh leaf added to his laurels. Once
     more their conversation was interrupted by the imperturbable Billy
     with his card-tray.

     "Lord Cantlemere, sir."

[line number in individual story] matching line = 719    window = 714 724

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 68552    window = 68547 68557


     with his card-tray.

     "Lord Cantlemere, sir."

     "Show him up, Billy. This is the eminent peer who represents the very
==>      highest interests," said Holmes. "He is an excellent and loyal <==
     person, but rather of the old regime. Shall we make him unbend? Dare
     we venture upon a slight liberty? He knows, we may conjecture,
     nothing of what has occurred."

     The door opened to admit a thin, austere figure with a hatchet face

[line number in individual story] matching line = 727    window = 722 732

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 68560    window = 68555 68565


     nothing of what has occurred."

     The door opened to admit a thin, austere figure with a hatchet face
     and drooping mid-Victorian whiskers of a glossy blackness which
     hardly corresponded with the rounded shoulders and feeble gait.
==>      Holmes advanced affably, and shook an unresponsive hand. <==

     "How do you do, Lord Cantlemere? It is chilly for the time of year,
     but rather warm indoors. May I take your overcoat?"

     "No, I thank you; I will not take it off."

     "Pray allow me! My friend Dr. Watson would assure you that these
     changes of temperature are most insidious."

     His Lordship shook himself free with some impatience.

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 68583    window = 68578 68588



     "I feared that you would find it so."

     There was a distinct sneer in the old courtier's words and manner.

==>      "Every man finds his limitations, Mr. Holmes, but at least it cures <==
     us of the weakness of self-satisfaction."

     "Yes, sir, I have been much perplexed."

     "No doubt."

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 68614    window = 68609 68619



     "You would arrest him upon that?"

     "Most undoubtedly."

==>      Holmes seldom laughed, but he got as near it as his old friend Watson <==
     could remember.

     "In that case, my dear sir, I shall be under the painful necessity of
     advising your arrest."


[line number in individual story] matching line = 790    window = 785 795

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 68623    window = 68618 68628


     advising your arrest."

     Lord Cantlemere was very angry. Some of the ancient fires flickered
     up into his sallow cheeks.

==>      "You take a great liberty, Mr. Holmes. In fifty years of official <==
     life I cannot recall such a case. I am a busy man, sir, engaged upon
     important affairs, and I have no time or taste for foolish jokes. I
     may tell you frankly, sir, that I have never been a believer in your
     powers, and that I have always been of the opinion that the matter
     was far safer in the hands of the regular police force. Your conduct

     was far safer in the hands of the regular police force. Your conduct
     confirms all my conclusions. I have the honour, sir, to wish you
     good-evening."

==>      Holmes had swiftly changed his position and was between the peer and <==
     the door.

     "One moment, sir," said he. "To actually go off with the Mazarin
     stone would be a more serious offence than to be found in temporary
     possession of it."

     "Come--come, do what I ask."

     An instant later the amazed peer was standing, blinking and
     stammering, with the great yellow stone on his shaking palm.

==>      "What! What! How is this, Mr. Holmes?" <==

     "Too bad, Lord Cantlemere, too bad!" cried Holmes. "My old friend
     here will tell you that I have an impish habit of practical joking.

==>      It was pleasant to Dr. Watson to find himself once more in the untidy <==
     room of the first floor in Baker Street which had been the
     starting-point of so many remarkable adventures. He looked round him
     at the scientific charts upon the wall, the acid-charred bench of
     chemicals, the violin-case leaning in the corner, the coal-scuttle,
     which contained of old the pipes and tobacco. Finally, his eyes came

     Billy glanced with some solicitude at the closed door of the bedroom.

     "I think he's in bed and asleep," he said.

==>      It was seven in the evening of a lovely summer's day, but Dr. Watson <==
     was sufficiently familiar with the irregularity of his old friend's
     hours to feel no surprise at the idea.

     "That means a case, I suppose?"

     funny behind it."

     Billy advanced and drew away the drapery which screened the alcove of
     the bow window.

==>      Dr. Watson could not restrain a cry of amazement. There was a <==
     facsimile of his old friend, dressing-gown and all, the face turned
     three-quarters towards the window and downward, as though reading an
     invisible book, while the body was sunk deep in an armchair. Billy
     detached the head and held it in the air.

     "Before my time," said Billy. He drew the window curtains apart and
     looked out into the street. "There are folk who watch us from over
     yonder. I can see a fellow now at the window. Have a look for
     yourself."

==>      Watson had taken a step forward when the bedroom door opened, and the <==
     long, thin form of Holmes emerged, his face pale and drawn, but his
     step and bearing as active as ever. With a single spring he was at
     the window, and had drawn the blind once more.

     "But why not eat?"

     The boy had reappeared in the room with a card upon a tray. Holmes
     glanced at it with raised eyebrows and an amused smile.

     "The man himself. I had hardly expected this. Grasp the nettle,

     his notebook and scribbled a few lines. "Take a cab to Scotland Yard
