     In the third week of November, in the year 1895, a dense yellow fog
     settled down upon London. From the Monday to the Thursday I doubt
     whether it was ever possible from our windows in Baker Street to see
==>      the loom of the opposite houses. The first day Holmes had spent in <==
     cross-indexing his huge book of references. The second and third had
     been patiently occupied upon a subject which he hand recently made
     his hobby--the music of the Middle Ages. But when, for the fourth
     time, after pushing back our chairs from breakfast we saw the greasy,
     heavy brown swirl still drifting past us and condensing in oily drops

     sitting-room in a fever of suppressed energy, biting his nails,
     tapping the furniture, and chafing against inaction.

     "Nothing of interest in the paper, Watson?" he said.

==>      In was aware that by anything of interest, Holmes meant anything of <==
     criminal interest. There was the news of a revolution, of a possible
     war, and of an impending change of government; but these did not come
     within the horizon of my companion. I could see nothing recorded in
     the shape of crime which was not commonplace and futile. Holmes
     groaned and resumed hs restless meanderings.

     groaned and resumed hs restless meanderings.

     "The London criminal is certainly a dull fellow," said he in the
     querulous voice of the sportsman whose game has failed him. "Look out
     this window, Watson. See how the figures loom up, are dimly seen, and

     could roam London on such a day as the tiger does the jungle, unseen
     until he pounces, and then evident only to his victim."

     "There have," said I, "been numerous petty thefts."

==>      Holmes snorted his contempt. <==

     "This great and sombre stage is set for something more worthy than
     that," said he. "It is fortunate for this community that I am not a
     criminal."

     my own pursuit? A summons, a bogus appointment, and all would be
     over. It is well they don't have days of fog in the Latin
     countries--the countries of assassination. By Jove! here comes
     something at last to break our dead monotony."

==>      It was the maid with a telegram. Holmes tore it open and burst out <==
     laughing.

     "Well, well! What next?" said he. "Brother Mycroft is coming round."

     "Why not?" I asked.

     the Diogenes Club, Whitehall--that is his cycle. Once, and only once,
     he has been here. What upheaval can possibly have derailed him?"

     "Does he not explain?"

     Must see you over Cadogen West. Coming at once.
     Mycroft.

     "Cadogen West? I have heard the name."

     Adventure of the Greek Interpreter.

     "You told me that he had some small office under the British
     government."

==>      Holmes chuckled. <==

     "I did not know you quite so well in those days. One has to be
     discreet when one talks of high matters of state. You are right in
     thinking that he under the British government. You would also be
     right in a sense if you said that occasionally he is the British

     discreet when one talks of high matters of state. You are right in
     thinking that he under the British government. You would also be
     right in a sense if you said that occasionally he is the British
     government."

==>      "My dear Holmes!" <==

     "I thought I might surprise you. Mycroft draws four hundred and fifty
     pounds a year, remains a subordinate, has no ambitions of any kind,
     will receive neither honour nor title, but remains the most
     indispensable man in the country."

     "I have it," I cried, and plunged among the litter of papers upon the
     sofa. "Yes, yes, here he is, sure enough! Cadogen West was the young
     man who was found dead on the Underground on Tuesday morning."

==>      Holmes sat up at attention, his pipe halfway to his lips. <==

     "This must be serious, Watson. A death which has caused my brother to
     alter his habits can be no ordinary one. What in the world can he
     have to do with it? The case was featureless as I remember it. The
     young man had apparently fallen out of the train and killed himself.

     Woolwich branch of the Capital and Counties Bank. Through this his
     identity was established. There were also two dress-circle tickets
     for the Woolwich Theatre, dated for that very evening. Also a small
     packet of technical papers."

==>      Holmes gave an exclamation of satisfaction. <==

     "There we have it at last, Watson! British government--Woolwich.
     Arsenal--technical papers--Brother Mycroft, the chain is complete.
     But here he comes, if I am not mistaken, to speak for himself."

     But here he comes, if I am not mistaken, to speak for himself."

==>      A moment later the tall and portly form of Mycroft Holmes was ushered <==
     into the room. Heavily built and massive, there was a suggestion of
     uncouth physical inertia in the figure, but above this unwieldy frame
     there was perched a head so masterful in its brow, so alert in its
     steel-gray, deep-set eyes, so firm in its lips, and so subtle in its
     play of expression, that after the first glance one forgot the gross

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 61298    window = 61293 61303


     play of expression, that after the first glance one forgot the gross
     body and remembered only the dominant mind.

     At his heels came our old friend Lestrade, of Scotland Yard--thin and
     austere. The gravity of both their faces foretold some weighty quest.
==>      The detective shook hands without a word. Mycroft Holmes struggled <==
     out of his overcoat and subsided into an armchair.

     "A most annoying business, Sherlock," said he. "I extremely dislike
     altering my habits, but the powers that be would take no denial. In
     the present state of Siam it is most awkward that I should be away

     "Ah, there's the point! Fortunately, it has not come out. The press
     would be furious if it did. The papers which this wretched youth had
     in his pocket were the plans of the Bruce-Partington submarine."

==>      Mycroft Holmes spoke with a solemnity which showed his sense of the <==
     importance of the subject. His brother and I sat expectant.

     "Surely you have heard of it? I thought everyone had heard of it."

     "Only as a name."

     "Why had he no ticket?"

     "The ticket would have shown which station was nearest the agent's
     house. Therefore he took it from the murdered man's pocket."

==>      "Good, Lestrade, very good," said Holmes. "Your theory holds <==
     together. But if this is true, then the case is at an end. On the one
     hand, the traitor is dead. On the other, the plans of the
     Bruce-Partington submarine are presumably already on the Continent.
     What is there for us to do?"

     "All my instincts are against this explanation. Use your powers! Go
     to the scene of the crime! See the people concerned! Leave no stone
     unturned! In all your career you have never had so great a chance of
     serving your country."

==>      "Well, well!" said Holmes, shrugging his shoulders. "Come, Watson! <==
     And you, Lestrade, could you favour us with your company for an hour
     or two? We will begin our investigation by a visit to Aldgate
     Station. Good-bye, Mycroft. I shall let you have a report before
     evening, but I warn you in advance that you have little to expect."

     Station. Good-bye, Mycroft. I shall let you have a report before
     evening, but I warn you in advance that you have little to expect."

==>      An hour later Holmes, Lestrade and I stood upon the Underground <==
     railroad at the point where it emerges from the tunnel immediately
     before Aldgate Station. A courteous red-faced old gentleman
     represented the railway company.

     "This is where the young man's body lay," said he, indicating a spot

[line number in individual story] matching line = 431    window = 426 436

     passenger who passed Aldgate in an ordinary Metropolitan train about
     11.40 on Monday night declares that he heard a heavy thud, as of a
     body striking the line, just before the train reached the station.
     There was dense fog, however, and nothing could be seen. He made no
     report of it at the time. Why, whatever is the matter with Mr.
==>      Holmes?" <==

     My friend was standing with an expression of strained intensity upon
     his face, staring at the railway metals where they curved out of the
     tunnel. Aldgate is a junction, and there was a network of points. On
     these his eager, questioning eyes were fixed, and I saw on his keen,

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 61540    window = 61535 61545



     "No; they are very few."

     "And a curve, too. Points, and a curve. By Jove! if it were only so."

==>      "What is it, Mr. Holmes? Have you a clue?" <==

     "An idea--an indication, no more. But the case certainly grows in
     interest. Unique, perfectly unique, and yet why not? I do not see any
     indications of bleeding on the line."


[line number in individual story] matching line = 467    window = 462 472

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 61556    window = 61551 61561



     "And yet one would have expected some bleeding. Would it be possible
     for me to inspect the train which contained the passenger who heard
     the thud of a fall in the fog?"

==>      "I fear not, Mr. Holmes. The train has been broken up before now, and <==
     the carriages redistributed."

     "I can assure you, Mr. Holmes," said Lestrade, "that every carriage
     has been carefully examined. I saw to it myself."


[line number in individual story] matching line = 470    window = 465 475

     "I fear not, Mr. Holmes. The train has been broken up before now, and
     the carriages redistributed."

==>      "I can assure you, Mr. Holmes," said Lestrade, "that every carriage <==
     has been carefully examined. I saw to it myself."

     It was one of my friend's most obvious weaknesses that he was
     impatient with less alert intelligences than his own.


[line number in individual story] matching line = 481    window = 476 486

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 61570    window = 61565 61575


     "Very likely," said he, turning away. "As it happens, it was not the
     carriages which I desired to examine. Watson, we have done all we can
     here. We need not trouble you any further, Mr. Lestrade. I think our
     investigations must now carry us to Woolwich."

==>      At London Bridge, Holmes wrote a telegram to his brother, which he <==
     handed to me before dispatching it. It ran thus:

     See some light in the darkness, but it may possibly flicker out.
     Meanwhile, please send by messenger, to await return at Baker Street,
     a complete list of all foreign spies or international agents known to

     energy, which showed me that some novel and suggestive circumstance
     had opened up a stimulating line of thought. See the foxhound with
     hanging ears and drooping tail as it lolls about the kennels, and
     compare it with the same hound as, with gleaming eyes and straining
     muscles, it runs upon a breast-high scent--such was the change in
==>      Holmes since the morning. He was a different man from the limp and <==
     lounging figure in the mouse-coloured dressing-gown who had prowled
     so restlessly only a few hours before round the fog-girt room.

     "There is material here. There is scope," said he. "I am dull indeed
     not to have understood its possibilities."

     "But suppose it were so, we are still as far as ever from unravelling
     the mystery of his death. Indeed, it becomes not simpler but
     stranger."

==>      "Perhaps," said Holmes, thoughtfully, "perhaps." He relapsed into a <==
     silent reverie, which lasted until the slow train drew up at last in
     Woolwich Station. There he called a cab and drew Mycroft's paper from
     his pocket.

     "We have quite a little round of afternoon calls to make," said he.

[line number in individual story] matching line = 551    window = 546 556

     our ring.

     "Sir James, sir!" said he with solemn face. "Sir James died this
     morning."

==>      "Good heavens!" cried Holmes in amazement. "How did he die?" <==

     "Perhaps you would care to step in, sir, and see his brother, Colonel
     Valentine?"

     "Yes, we had best do so."

     But all the rest was inconceivable."

     "You cannot throw any new light upon the affair?"

     "I know nothing myself save what I have read or heard. I have no
==>      desire to be discourteous, but you can understand, Mr. Holmes, that <==
     we are much disturbed at present, and I must ask you to hasten this
     interview to an end."

     "This is indeed an unexpected development," said my friend when we
     had regained the cab. "I wonder if the death was natural, or whether

     the bereaved mother. The old lady was too dazed with grief to be of
     any use to us, but at her side was a white-faced young lady, who
     introduced herself as Miss Violet Westbury, the fiancee of the dead
     man, and the last to see him upon that fatal night.

==>      "I cannot explain it, Mr. Holmes," she said. "I have not shut an eye <==
     since the tragedy, thinking, thinking, thinking, night and day, what
     the true meaning of it can be. Arthur was the most single-minded,
     chivalrous, patriotic man upon earth. He would have cut his right
     hand off before he would sell a State secret confided to his keeping.
     It is absurd, impossible, preposterous to anyone who knew him."

     "Only for the last week or so. He was thoughtful and worried. Once I
     pressed him about it. He admitted that there was something, and that
     it was concerned with his official life. 'It is too serious for me to
     speak about, even to you,' said he. I could get nothing more."

==>      Holmes looked grave. <==

     "Go on, Miss Westbury. Even if it seems to tell against him, go on.
     We cannot say what it may lead to."

     "Indeed, I have nothing more to tell. Once or twice it seemed to me

     "Without a word?"

     "He gave an exclamation; that was all. I waited but he never
     returned. Then I walked home. Next morning, after the office opened,
     they came to inquire. About twelve o'clock we heard the terrible
==>      news. Oh, Mr. Holmes, if you could only, only save his honour! It was <==
     so much to him."

     Holmes shook his head sadly.

     they came to inquire. About twelve o'clock we heard the terrible
     news. Oh, Mr. Holmes, if you could only, only save his honour! It was
     so much to him."

==>      Holmes shook his head sadly. <==

     "Come, Watson," said he, "our ways lie elsewhere. Our next station
     must be the office from which the papers were taken.

     marriage gives a motive for the crime. He naturally wanted money. The
     idea was in his head, since he spoke about it. He nearly made the
     girl an accomplice in the treason by telling her his plans. It is all
     very bad."

==>      "But surely, Holmes, character goes for something? Then, again, why <==
     should he leave the girl in the street and dart away to commit a
     felony?"

     "Exactly! There are certainly objections. But it is a formidable case
     which they have to meet."

     received us with that respect which my companion's card always
     commanded. He was a thin, gruff, bespectacled man of middle age, his
     cheeks haggard, and his hands twitching from the nervous strain to
     which he had been subjected.

==>      "It is bad, Mr. Holmes, very bad! Have you heard of the death of the <==
     chief?"

     "We have just come from his house."

     "But I suppose either Sir James, or you, or West has that technical
     knowledge?"

     "No doubt we had, but I beg you won't try to drag me into the matter,
==>      Mr. Holmes. What is the use of our speculating in this way when the <==
     original plans were actually found on West?"

     "Well, it is certainly singular that he should run the risk of taking
     originals if he could safely have taken copies, which would have
     equally served his turn."

     was he that he could hardly pick up his change, and the clerk had
     helped him with it. A reference to the timetable showed that the 8.15
     was the first train which it was possible for West to take after he
     had left the lady about 7.30.

==>      "Let us reconstruct, Watson," said Holmes after half an hour of <==
     silence. "I am not aware that in all our joint researches we have
     ever had a case which was more difficult to get at. Every fresh
     advance which we make only reveals a fresh ridge beyond. And yet we
     have surely made some appreciable progress.

     Metropolitan train. My instinct now is to work form the other end. If
     Mycroft has given us the list of addresses we may be able to pick our
     man and follow two tracks instead of one."

     Surely enough, a note awaited us at Baker Street. A government
==>      messenger had brought it post-haste. Holmes glanced at it and threw <==
     it over to me.

     There are numerous small fry, but few who would handle so big an
     affair. The only men worth considering are Adolph Mayer, of 13 Great
     George Street, Westminster; Louis La Rothiere, of Campden Mansions,

     all the queen's men cannot avail in this matter." He had spread out
     his big map of London and leaned eagerly over it. "Well, well," said
     he presently with an exclamation of satisfaction, "things are turning
     a little in our direction at last. Why, Watson, I do honestly believe
     that we are going to pull it off, after all." He slapped me on the

     of Caulfield Gardens open on the line but the even more essential
     fact that, owing to the intersection of one of the larger railways,
     the Underground trains are frequently held motionless for some
     minutes at that very spot."

     "So far--so far, Watson. We advance, but the goal is afar. Well,
     having seen the back of Caulfield Gardens, I visited the front and
     satisfied myself that the bird was indeed flown. It is a considerable
     house, unfurnished, so far as I could judge, in the upper rooms.

     "My dear fellow, you shall keep watch in the street. I'll do the

     Mycroft's note, of the Admiralty, the Cabinet, the exalted person who

     My answer was to rise from the table.

     He sprang up and shook me by the hand.

     "I knew you would not shrink at the last," said he, and for a moment
     I saw something in his eyes which was nearer to tenderness than I had

     Caulfield Gardens was one of those lines of flat-faced pillared, and
     porticoed houses which are so prominent a product of the middle
     Victorian epoch in the West End of London. Next door there appeared
     to be a children's party, for the merry buzz of young voices and the
     clatter of a piano resounded through the night. The fog still hung
==>      about and screened us with its friendly shade. Holmes had lit his <==
     lantern and flashed it upon the massive door.

     "This is a serious proposition," said he. "It is certainly bolted as
     well as locked. We would do better in the area. There is an excellent
     archway down yonder in case a too zealous policeman should intrude.

     Give me a hand, Watson, and I'll do the same for you."

     A minute later we were both in the area. Hardly had we reached the
     dark shadows before the step of the policeman was heard in the fog

     lower door. I saw him stoop and strain until with a sharp crash it
     flew open. We sprang through into the dark passage, closing the area

     His little fan of yellow light shone upon a low window.

     We had not long to wait. The very next train roared from the tunnel
     as before, but slowed in the open, and then, with a creaking of
     brakes, pulled up immediately beneath us. It was not four feet from

     the window.

     "So far we are justified," said he. "What do you think of it,

     the first floor. One was a dining-room, severely furnished and
     containing nothing of interest. A second was a bedroom, which also
     drew blank. The remaining room appeared more promising, and my
     companion settled down to a systematic examination. It was littered
     with books and papers, and was evidently used as a study. Swiftly and
==>      methodically Holmes turned over the contents of drawer after drawer <==
     and cupboard after cupboard, but no gleam of success came to brighten
     his austere face. At the end of an hour he was no further than when

     destroyed or removed. This is our last chance."

     pried it open with his chisel. Several rolls of paper were within,
     covered with figures and calculations, without any note to show to

     "pressure to the square inch" suggested some possible relation to a

     thoughts on to lighter things whenever he had convinced himself that
     he could no longer work to advantage. I remember that during the
     whole of that memorable day he lost himself in a monograph which he

     experiment which we were trying--all combined to work upon my nerve.
     It was a relief to me when at last, after a light dinner, we set out
     upon our expedition. Lestrade and Mycroft met us by appointment at
     the outside of Gloucester Road Station. The area door of Oberstein's
     house had been left open the night before, and it was necessary for
==>      me, as Mycroft Holmes absolutely and indignantly declined to climb <==
     the railings, to pass in and open the hall door. By nine o'clock we
     were all seated in the study, waiting patently for our man.

     An hour passed and yet another. When eleven struck, the measured beat
     of the great church clock seemed to sound the dirge of our hopes.

     a dark figure slipped past him he closed and fastened it. "This way!"

     over his forehead, like one who cannot believe his own senses.

     "What is this?" he asked. "I came here to visit Mr. Oberstein."

     The man groaned and sank his face in his hands. We waited, but he was
     silent.

     impress of the keys which your brother held; and that you entered

     know, he never held up his head again."

     the shape of crime which was not commonplace and futile. Holmes
     groaned and resumed hs restless meanderings.

     "The London criminal is certainly a dull fellow," said he in the
     querulous voice of the sportsman whose game has failed him. "Look out

     could roam London on such a day as the tiger does the jungle, unseen

     man who was found dead on the Underground on Tuesday morning."

     Holmes sat up at attention, his pipe halfway to his lips.

     have to do with it? The case was featureless as I remember it. The

     violence. Is that not so?"

     station from which he came? It is possible. Or did he drop it in the
     carriage? That is also possible. But the point is of curious

     for the Woolwich Theatre, dated for that very evening. Also a small
     packet of technical papers."

     Holmes gave an exclamation of satisfaction.

==>      "There we have it at last, Watson! British government--Woolwich. <==
     Arsenal--technical papers--Brother Mycroft, the chain is complete.
     But here he comes, if I am not mistaken, to speak for himself."

     A moment later the tall and portly form of Mycroft Holmes was ushered
     into the room. Heavily built and massive, there was a suggestion of

[line number in individual story] matching line = 400    window = 395 405

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 61489    window = 61484 61494


     "All my instincts are against this explanation. Use your powers! Go
     to the scene of the crime! See the people concerned! Leave no stone
     unturned! In all your career you have never had so great a chance of
     serving your country."

==>      "Well, well!" said Holmes, shrugging his shoulders. "Come, Watson! <==
     And you, Lestrade, could you favour us with your company for an hour
     or two? We will begin our investigation by a visit to Aldgate
     Station. Good-bye, Mycroft. I shall let you have a report before
     evening, but I warn you in advance that you have little to expect."


[line number in individual story] matching line = 477    window = 472 482

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 61566    window = 61561 61571



     It was one of my friend's most obvious weaknesses that he was
     impatient with less alert intelligences than his own.

     "Very likely," said he, turning away. "As it happens, it was not the
==>      carriages which I desired to examine. Watson, we have done all we can <==
     here. We need not trouble you any further, Mr. Lestrade. I think our
     investigations must now carry us to Woolwich."

     At London Bridge, Holmes wrote a telegram to his brother, which he
     handed to me before dispatching it. It ran thus:

[line number in individual story] matching line = 490    window = 485 495

     Meanwhile, please send by messenger, to await return at Baker Street,
     a complete list of all foreign spies or international agents known to
     be in England, with full address.
     Sherlock.

==>      "That should be helpful, Watson," he remarked as we took our seats in <==
     the Woolwich train.  "We certainly owe Brother Mycroft a debt for
     having introduced us to what promises to be a really very remarkable
     case."

     His eager face still wore that expression of intense and high-strung

[line number in individual story] matching line = 667    window = 662 672

     news. Oh, Mr. Holmes, if you could only, only save his honour! It was
     so much to him."

     Holmes shook his head sadly.

==>      "Come, Watson," said he, "our ways lie elsewhere. Our next station <==
     must be the office from which the papers were taken.

     "It was black enough before against this young man, but our inquiries
     make it blacker," he remarked as the cab lumbered off. "His coming
     marriage gives a motive for the crime. He naturally wanted money. The

     pointed out to me that they hardly met in the centre, and that it
     would be possible for anyone outside to see what was going on within
     the room.

     "The indications are ruined by three days' delay. They may mean
==>      something or nothing. Well, Watson, I do not think that Woolwich can <==
     help us further. It is a small crop which we have gathered. Let us
     see if we can do better in London."

     Yet we added one more sheaf to our harvest before we left Woolwich
     Station. The clerk in the ticket office was able to say with

[line number in individual story] matching line = 821    window = 816 826

     was he that he could hardly pick up his change, and the clerk had
     helped him with it. A reference to the timetable showed that the 8.15
     was the first train which it was possible for West to take after he
     had left the lady about 7.30.

==>      "Let us reconstruct, Watson," said Holmes after half an hour of <==
     silence. "I am not aware that in all our joint researches we have
     ever had a case which was more difficult to get at. Every fresh
     advance which we make only reveals a fresh ridge beyond. And yet we
     have surely made some appreciable progress.

     "I'm afraid," said Holmes, smiling, "that all the queen's horses and
     all the queen's men cannot avail in this matter." He had spread out
     his big map of London and leaned eagerly over it. "Well, well," said
     he presently with an exclamation of satisfaction, "things are turning
==>      a little in our direction at last. Why, Watson, I do honestly believe <==
     that we are going to pull it off, after all." He slapped me on the
     shoulder with a sudden burst of hilarity. "I am going out now. It is
     only a reconnaissance. I will do nothing serious without my trusted
     comrade and biographer at my elbow. Do you stay here, and the odds
     are that you will see me again in an hour or two. If time hangs heavy

     "They are here, in my overcoat."

     "Excellent. Let me give you a short sketch of what I have done, with
     some indication of what we are about to do. Now it must be evident to
==>      you, Watson, that this young man's body was placed on the roof of the <==
     train. That was clear from the instant that I determined the fact
     that it was from the roof, and not from a carriage, that he had
     fallen."

     "Could it not have been dropped from a bridge?"

[line number in individual story] matching line = 956    window = 951 961

     the Underground trains are frequently held motionless for some
     minutes at that very spot."

     "Splendid, Holmes! You have got it!"

==>      "So far--so far, Watson. We advance, but the goal is afar. Well, <==
     having seen the back of Caulfield Gardens, I visited the front and
     satisfied myself that the bird was indeed flown. It is a considerable
     house, unfurnished, so far as I could judge, in the upper rooms.
     Oberstein lived there with a single valet, who was probably a
     confederate entirely in his confidence. We must bear in mind that

     lantern and flashed it upon the massive door.

     "This is a serious proposition," said he. "It is certainly bolted as
     well as locked. We would do better in the area. There is an excellent
     archway down yonder in case a too zealous policeman should intrude.
==>      Give me a hand, Watson, and I'll do the same for you." <==

     A minute later we were both in the area. Hardly had we reached the
     dark shadows before the step of the policeman was heard in the fog
     above. As its soft rhythm died away, Holmes set to work upon the
     lower door. I saw him stoop and strain until with a sharp crash it

     lower door. I saw him stoop and strain until with a sharp crash it
     flew open. We sprang through into the dark passage, closing the area
     door behind us. Holmes let the way up the curving, uncarpeted stair.
     His little fan of yellow light shone upon a low window.

==>      "Here we are, Watson--this must be the one." He threw it open, and as <==
     he did so there was a low, harsh murmur, growing steadily into a loud
     roar as a train dashed past us in the darkness. Holmes swept his
     light along the window-sill. It was thickly coated with soot from the
     passing engines, but the black surface was blurred and rubbed in
     places.

[line number in individual story] matching line = 1025    window = 1020 1030

     roar as a train dashed past us in the darkness. Holmes swept his
     light along the window-sill. It was thickly coated with soot from the
     passing engines, but the black surface was blurred and rubbed in
     places.

==>      "You can see where they rested the body. Halloa, Watson! what is <==
     this? There can be no doubt that it is a blood mark." He was pointing
     to faint discolourations along the woodwork of the window. "Here it
     is on the stone of the stair also. The demonstration is complete. Let
     us stay here until a train stops."

     brakes, pulled up immediately beneath us. It was not four feet from
     the window-ledge to the roof of the carriages. Holmes softly closed
     the window.

     "So far we are justified," said he. "What do you think of it,
==>      Watson?" <==

     "A masterpiece. You have never risen to a greater height."

     "I cannot agree with you there. From the moment that I conceived the
     idea of the body being upon the roof, which surely was not a very

     submarine. Holmes tossed them all impatiently aside. There only
     remained an envelope with some small newspaper slips inside it. He
     shook them out on the table, and at once I saw by his eager face that
     his hopes had been raised.

==>      "What's this, Watson? Eh? What's this? Record of a series of messages <==
     in the advertisements of a paper. Daily Telegraph agony column by the
     print and paper. Right-hand top corner of a page. No dates--but

==>      "A fairly complete record, Watson! If we could only get at the man at <==
     the other end!" He sat lost in thought, tapping his fingers on the
     table. Finally he sprang to his feet.

     "Well, perhaps it won't be so difficult, after all. There is nothing
     more to be done here, Watson. I think we might drive round to the

     conclusion."

     Mycroft Holmes and Lestrade had come round by appointment after
     breakfast next day and Sherlock Holmes had recounted to them our

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 62209    window = 62204 62214


     "We can't do these things in the force, Mr. Holmes," said he. "No
     wonder you get results that are beyond us. But some of these days
     you'll go too far, and you'll find yourself and your friend in
     trouble."

==>      "For England, home and beauty--eh, Watson? Martyrs on the altar of <==
     our country. But what do you think of it, Mycroft?"

     "Excellent, Sherlock! Admirable! But what use will you make of it?"

     Holmes picked up the Daily Telegraph which lay upon the table.

     sown from his lips, and there were the long light beard and the soft,
     handsome delicate features of Colonel Valentine Walter.

     Holmes gave a whistle of surprise.

     not the bird that I was looking for."

     "Who is he?" asked Mycroft eagerly.

     there was perched a head so masterful in its brow, so alert in its
     steel-gray, deep-set eyes, so firm in its lips, and so subtle in its
     play of expression, that after the first glance one forgot the gross
     body and remembered only the dominant mind.

==>      At his heels came our old friend Lestrade, of Scotland Yard--thin and <==
     austere. The gravity of both their faces foretold some weighty quest.
     The detective shook hands without a word. Mycroft Holmes struggled
     out of his overcoat and subsided into an armchair.

     "A most annoying business, Sherlock," said he. "I extremely dislike

     to convey these papers to London. He would naturally have made an
     appointment with the foreign agent and kept his evening clear.
     Instead of that he took two tickets for the theatre, escorted his
     fiancee halfway there, and then suddenly disappeared."

     to the conversation.

     "A very singular one. That is objection No. 1. Objection No. 2: We
     will suppose that he reaches London and sees the foreign agent. He
     must bring back the papers before morning or the loss will be

     discovered. He took away ten. Only seven were in his pocket. What had
     become of the other three? He certainly would not leave them of his
     own free will. Then, again, where is the price of his treason? Once
     would have expected to find a large sum of money in his pocket."

==>      "It seems to me perfectly clear," said Lestrade. "I have no doubt at <==
     all as to what occurred. He took the papers to sell them. He saw the
     agent. They could not agree as to price. He started home again, but
     the agent went with him. In the train the agent murdered him, took
     the more essential papers, and threw his body from the carriage. That
     would account for everything, would it not?"

     "Why had he no ticket?"

     "The ticket would have shown which station was nearest the agent's
     house. Therefore he took it from the murdered man's pocket."

==>      "Good, Lestrade, very good," said Holmes. "Your theory holds <==
     together. But if this is true, then the case is at an end. On the one
     hand, the traitor is dead. On the other, the plans of the
     Bruce-Partington submarine are presumably already on the Continent.

==>      An hour later Holmes, Lestrade and I stood upon the Underground <==
     railroad at the point where it emerges from the tunnel immediately
     before Aldgate Station. A courteous red-faced old gentleman
     represented the railway company.

     "No record of a door being found open?"

     "None."

     passenger who passed Aldgate in an ordinary Metropolitan train about
     11.40 on Monday night declares that he heard a heavy thud, as of a
     body striking the line, just before the train reached the station.
     There was dense fog, however, and nothing could be seen. He made no
     report of it at the time. Why, whatever is the matter with Mr.

     the thud of a fall in the fog?"

     "I fear not, Mr. Holmes. The train has been broken up before now, and
     the carriages redistributed."

==>      "I can assure you, Mr. Holmes," said Lestrade, "that every carriage <==
     has been carefully examined. I saw to it myself."

     It was one of my friend's most obvious weaknesses that he was
     impatient with less alert intelligences than his own.


[line number in individual story] matching line = 478    window = 473 483

     It was one of my friend's most obvious weaknesses that he was

     "Very likely," said he, turning away. "As it happens, it was not the
     carriages which I desired to examine. Watson, we have done all we can

     investigations must now carry us to Woolwich."

     At London Bridge, Holmes wrote a telegram to his brother, which he
     handed to me before dispatching it. It ran thus:

==>      Mycroft Holmes and Lestrade had come round by appointment after <==
     breakfast next day and Sherlock Holmes had recounted to them our
     proceedings of the day before. The professional shook his head over
     our confessed burglary.

     I had none of this power of detachment, and the day, in consequence,
     appeared to be interminable. The great national importance of the
     issue, the suspense in high quarters, the direct nature of the
     experiment which we were trying--all combined to work upon my nerve.
     It was a relief to me when at last, after a light dinner, we set out
==>      upon our expedition. Lestrade and Mycroft met us by appointment at <==
     the outside of Gloucester Road Station. The area door of Oberstein's
     house had been left open the night before, and it was necessary for
     me, as Mycroft Holmes absolutely and indignantly declined to climb
     the railings, to pass in and open the hall door. By nine o'clock we
     were all seated in the study, waiting patently for our man.
