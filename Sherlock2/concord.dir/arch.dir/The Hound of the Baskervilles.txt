==>      Mr. Sherlock Holmes, who was usually very late in the mornings, save <==
     upon those not infrequent occasions when he was up all night, was
     seated at the breakfast table. I stood upon the hearth-rug and picked
     up the stick which our visitor had left behind him the night before.
     It was a fine, thick piece of wood, bulbous-headed, of the sort which
     is known as a "Penang lawyer." Just under the head was a broad silver

     It was just such a stick as the old-fashioned family practitioner
     used to carry--dignified, solid, and reassuring.

     "Well, Watson, what do you make of it?"

==>      Holmes was sitting with his back to me, and I had given him no sign <==
     of my occupation.

     "How did you know what I was doing? I believe you have eyes in the
     back of your head."

     "I think," said I, following as far as I could the methods of my
     companion, "that Dr. Mortimer is a successful, elderly medical man,
     well-esteemed since those who know him give him this mark of their
     appreciation."

==>      "Good!" said Holmes. "Excellent!" <==

     "I think also that the probability is in favour of his being a
     country practitioner who does a great deal of his visiting on foot."

     "Why so?"

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 44378    window = 44373 44383


     "Because this stick, though originally a very handsome one has been
     so knocked about that I can hardly imagine a town practitioner
     carrying it. The thick-iron ferrule is worn down, so it is evident
     that he has done a great amount of walking with it."

==>      "Perfectly sound!" said Holmes. <==

     "And then again, there is the 'friends of the C.C.H.' I should guess
     that to be the Something Hunt, the local hunt to whose members he has
     possibly given some surgical assistance, and which has made him a
     small presentation in return."

==>      "Really, Watson, you excel yourself," said Holmes, pushing back his <==
     chair and lighting a cigarette. "I am bound to say that in all the
     accounts which you have been so good as to give of my own small
     achievements you have habitually underrated your own abilities. It
     may be that you are not yourself luminous, but you are a conductor of
     light. Some people without possessing genius have a remarkable power

     absent-minded, and the possessor of a favourite dog, which I should
     describe roughly as being larger than a terrier and smaller than a
     mastiff."

==>      I laughed incredulously as Sherlock Holmes leaned back in his settee <==
     and blew little wavering rings of smoke up to the ceiling.

     "As to the latter part, I have no means of checking you," said I,
     "but at least it is not difficult to find out a few particulars about
     the man's age and professional career." From my small medical shelf I

     mischievous smile, "but a country doctor, as you very astutely
     observed. I think that I am fairly justified in my inferences. As to
     the adjectives, I said, if I remember right, amiable, unambitious,
     and absent-minded. It is my experience that it is only an amiable man
     in this world who receives testimonials, only an unambitious one who

     door-step, and there is the ring of its owner. Don't move, I beg you,
     Watson. He is a professional brother of yours, and your presence may
     be of assistance to me. Now is the dramatic moment of fate, Watson,
     when you hear a step upon the stair which is walking into your life,
     and you know not whether for good or ill. What does Dr. James

     in crime? Come in!"

     The appearance of our visitor was a surprise to me, since I had
     expected a typical country practitioner. He was a very tall, thin
     man, with a long nose like a beak, which jutted out between two keen,

     gray eyes, set closely together and sparkling brightly from behind a
     pair of gold-rimmed glasses. He was clad in a professional but rather
     slovenly fashion, for his frock-coat was dingy and his trousers
     frayed. Though young, his long back was already bowed, and he walked
     with a forward thrust of his head and a general air of peering
==>      benevolence. As he entered his eyes fell upon the stick in Holmes's <==
     hand, and he ran towards it with an exclamation of joy. "I am so very
     glad," said he. "I was not sure whether I had left it here or in the
     Shipping Office. I would not lose that stick for the world."

     "A presentation, I see," said Holmes.

     "From Charing Cross Hospital?"

     "From one or two friends there on the occasion of my marriage."

==>      "Dear, dear, that's bad!" said Holmes, shaking his head. <==

     Dr. Mortimer blinked through his glasses in mild astonishment.

     "Why was it bad?"

     of a consulting practice. It was necessary to make a home of my own."

     well-marked supra-orbital development. Would you have any objection
     to my running my finger along your parietal fissure? A cast of your
     skull, sir, until the original is available, would be an ornament to
     any anthropological museum. It is not my intention to be fulsome, but
     I confess that I covet your skull."

     enthusiast in your line of thought, I perceive, sir, as I am in
     mine," said he. "I observe from your forefinger that you make your
     own cigarettes. Have no hesitation in lighting one."

     The man drew out paper and tobacco and twirled the one up in the
     other with surprising dexterity. He had long, quivering fingers as
     agile and restless as the antennae of an insect.

==>      Holmes was silent, but his little darting glances showed me the <==
     interest which he took in our curious companion.

     "I presume, sir," said he at last, "that it was not merely for the
     purpose of examining my skull that you have done me the honour to
     call here last night and again to-day?"

     am myself an unpractical man and because I am suddenly confronted
     with a most serious and extraordinary problem. Recognizing, as I do,
     that you are the second highest expert in Europe--"

     man of affairs it is acknowledged that you stand alone. I trust, sir,
     that I have not inadvertently--"

==>      "Just a little," said Holmes. "I think, Dr. Mortimer, you would do <==
     wisely if without more ado you would kindly tell me plainly what the
     exact nature of the problem is in which you demand my assistance."

     "I have in my pocket a manuscript," said Dr. James Mortimer.

     "It is an old manuscript."

     "Early eighteenth century, unless it is a forgery."

     his personal friend as well as his medical attendant. He was a
     strong-minded man, sir, shrewd, practical, and as unimaginative as I
     am myself. Yet he took this document very seriously, and his mind was
     prepared for just such an end as did eventually overtake him."

==>      Holmes stretched out his hand for the manuscript and flattened it <==
     upon his knee.

     "You will observe, Watson, the alternative use of the long s and the
     short. It is one of several indications which enabled me to fix the
     date."

     "Most modern. A most practical, pressing matter, which must be
     decided within twenty-four hours. But the manuscript is short and is
     intimately connected with the affair. With your permission I will
     read it to you."

==>      Holmes leaned back in his chair, placed his finger-tips together, and <==
     closed his eyes, with an air of resignation. Dr. Mortimer turned the
     manuscript to the light and read in a high, cracking voice the
     following curious, old-world narrative:--

     "Of the origin of the Hound of the Baskervilles there have been many

     instructions that they say nothing thereof to their sister
     Elizabeth.]"

     When Dr. Mortimer had finished reading this singular narrative he
     pushed his spectacles up on his forehead and stared across at Mr.
==>      Sherlock Holmes. The latter yawned and tossed the end of his <==
     cigarette into the fire.

     "Well?" said he.

     "Do you not find it interesting?"

     "To a collector of fairy tales."

     Dr. Mortimer drew a folded newspaper out of his pocket.

==>      "Now, Mr. Holmes, we will give you something a little more recent. <==
     This is the Devon County Chronicle of May 14th of this year. It is a
     short account of the facts elicited at the death of Sir Charles
     Baskerville which occurred a few days before that date."

     My friend leaned a little forward and his expression became intent.

     inquiries are being instituted with a view to informing him of his
     good fortune."

     Dr. Mortimer refolded his paper and replaced it in his pocket.

==>      "Those are the public facts, Mr. Holmes, in connection with the death <==
     of Sir Charles Baskerville."

     "I must thank you," said Sherlock Holmes, "for calling my attention
     to a case which certainly presents some features of interest. I had

     to a case which certainly presents some features of interest. I had
     observed some newspaper comment at the time, but I was exceedingly
     preoccupied by that little affair of the Vatican cameos, and in my
     anxiety to oblige the Pope I lost touch with several interesting
     English cases. This article, you say, contains all the public facts?"

     "Within the last few months it became increasingly plain to me that
     Sir Charles's nervous system was strained to the breaking point. He
     had taken this legend which I have read you exceedingly to heart--so
     much so that, although he would walk in his own grounds, nothing
     would induce him to go out upon the moor at night. Incredible as it

     dreadful fate overhung his family, and certainly the records which he
     was able to give of his ancestors were not encouraging. The idea of
     some ghastly presence constantly haunted him, and on more than one
     occasion he has asked me whether I had on my medical journeys at
     night ever seen any strange creature or heard the baying of a hound.

     I confess at these words a shudder passed through me. There was a
     thrill in the doctor's voice which showed that he was himself deeply

     "He had left his own marks all over that small patch of gravel. I
     could discern no others."

     gesture.

     "If I had only been there!" he cried. "It is evidently a case of
     extraordinary interest, and one which presented immense opportunities
     to the scientific expert. That gravel page upon which I might have

     by the clogs of curious peasants. Oh, Dr. Mortimer, Dr. Mortimer, to
     think that you should not have called me in! You have indeed much to
     answer for."

==>      "I could not call you in, Mr. Holmes, without disclosing these facts <==
     to the world, and I have already given my reasons for not wishing to
     do so. Besides, besides--"

     "And you, a trained man of science, believe it to be supernatural?"

     "I have hitherto confined my investigations to this world," said he.
     "In a modest way I have combated evil, but to take on the Father of
     Evil himself would, perhaps, be too ambitious a task. Yet you must
     admit that the footmark is material."

     there in 1876 of yellow fever. Henry is the last of the Baskervilles.
     In one hour and five minutes I meet him at Waterloo Station. I have

     Sir Charles will crash to the ground if there is no tenant of the
     Hall. I fear lest I should be swayed too much by my own obvious
     interest in the matter, and that is why I bring the case before you
     and ask for your advice."

==>      Holmes considered for a little time. <==

     "Put into plain words, the matter is this," said he. "In your opinion
     there is a diabolical agency which makes Dartmoor an unsafe abode for
     a Baskerville--that is your opinion?"

     "Exactly. But surely, if your supernatural theory be correct, it
     could work the young man evil in London as easily as in Devonshire. A
     devil with merely local powers like a parish vestry would be too
     inconceivable a thing."

==>      "You put the matter more flippantly, Mr. Holmes, than you would <==
     probably do if you were brought into personal contact with these
     things. Your advice, then, as I understand it, is that the young man

     much obliged to you if you will call upon me here, and it will be of
     help to me in my plans for the future if you will bring Sir Henry

     My first impression as I opened the door was that a fire had broken
     out, for the room was so filled with smoke that the light of the lamp
     upon the table was blurred by it. As I entered, however, my fears
     were set at rest, for it was the acrid fumes of strong coarse tobacco
     which took me by the throat and set me coughing. Through the haze I

     paper lay around him.

     ask you to hand me my violin, and we will postpone all further
     thought upon this business until we have had the advantage of meeting
     Dr. Mortimer and Sir Henry Baskerville in the morning."

==>      Our breakfast-table was cleared early, and Holmes waited in his <==
     dressing-gown for the promised interview. Our clients were punctual
     to their appointment, for the clock had just struck ten when Dr.
     Mortimer was shown up, followed by the young baronet. The latter was
     a small, alert, dark-eyed man about thirty years of age, very
     sturdily built, with thick black eyebrows and a strong, pugnacious

     yet there was something in his steady eye and the quiet assurance of
     his bearing which indicated the gentleman.

     "This is Sir Henry Baskerville," said Dr. Mortimer.

==>      "Why, yes," said he, "and the strange thing is, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, <==
     that if my friend here had not proposed coming round to you this
     morning I should have come on my own account. I understand that you
     think out little puzzles, and I've had one this morning which wants
     more thinking out than I am able to give it."

     have yourself had some remarkable experience since you arrived in
     London?"

     It was this letter, if you can call it a letter, which reached me
     this morning."

     He laid an envelope upon the table, and we all bent over it. It was
     of common quality, grayish in colour. The address, "Sir Henry

     the postmark "Charing Cross," and the date of posting the preceding
     evening.

     "Who knew that you were going to the Northumberland Hotel?" asked
==>      Holmes, glancing keenly across at our visitor. <==

     "No one could have known. We only decided after I met Dr. Mortimer."

     "But Dr. Mortimer was no doubt already stopping there?"

     As you value your life or your reason keep away from the moor.

     The word "moor" only was printed in ink.

     "Now," said Sir Henry Baskerville, "perhaps you will tell me, Mr.
==>      Holmes, what in thunder is the meaning of that, and who it is that <==
     takes so much interest in my affairs?"

     "What do you make of it, Dr. Mortimer? You must allow that there is
     nothing supernatural about this, at any rate?"

     you gentlemen know a great deal more than I do about my own affairs."

     "You shall share our knowledge before you leave this room, Sir Henry.
==>      I promise you that," said Sherlock Holmes. "We will confine ourselves <==
     for the present with your permission to this very interesting
     document, which must have been put together and posted yesterday
     evening. Have you yesterday's Times, Watson?"

     "It is here in the corner."

     stands to reason that such legislation must in the long run keep away
     wealth from the country, diminish the value of our imports, and lower
     the general conditions of life in this island.'

==>      "What do you think of that, Watson?" cried Holmes in high glee, <==
     rubbing his hands together with satisfaction. "Don't you think that
     is an admirable sentiment?"

     Dr. Mortimer looked at Holmes with an air of professional interest,
     and Sir Henry Baskerville turned a pair of puzzled dark eyes upon me.

     he; "but it seems to me we've got a bit off the trail so far as that
     note is concerned."

     "Well, now--so it is!"

     imagined," said Dr. Mortimer, gazing at my friend in amazement. "I
     could understand anyone saying that the words were from a newspaper;
     but that you should name which, and add that it came from the leading
     article, is really one of the most remarkable things which I have
     ever known. How did you do it?"

     with the Western Morning News. But a Times leader is entirely
     distinctive, and these words could have been taken from nothing else.
     As it was done yesterday the strong probability was that we should
     find the words in yesterday's issue."

==>      "So far as I can follow you, then, Mr. Holmes," said Sir Henry <==
     Baskerville, "someone cut out this message with a scissors--"

     "Nail-scissors," said Holmes. "You can see that it was a very
     short-bladed scissors, since the cutter had to take two snips over
     'keep away.'"

     "Because he could not find it in print. The other words were all

     common."

     "There are one or two indications, and yet the utmost pains have been
     taken to remove all clues. The address, you observe is printed in
     rough characters. But the Times is a paper which is seldom found in
     any hands but those of the highly educated. We may take it,

     "You have not observed anyone follow or watch you?"

     our visitor. "Why in thunder should anyone follow or watch me?"

     You see, if I am to be squire down there I must dress the part, and
     it may be that I have got a little careless in my ways out West.
     Among other things I bought these brown boots--gave six dollars for
     them--and had one stolen before ever I had them on my feet."

==>      "It seems a singularly useless thing to steal," said Sherlock Holmes. <==
     "I confess that I share Dr. Mortimer's belief that it will not be
     long before the missing boot is found."

     "And, now, gentlemen," said the baronet with decision, "it seems to
     me that I have spoken quite enough about the little that I know. It

     is time that you kept your promise and gave me a full account of what
     we are all driving at."

     Mortimer, I think you could not do better than to tell your story as
     you told it to us."

     Thus encouraged, our scientific friend drew his papers from his
     pocket, and presented the whole case as he had done upon the morning

     suppose that fits into its place."

     "It seems to show that someone knows more than we do about what goes
     on upon the moor," said Dr. Mortimer.

==>      "And also," said Holmes, "that someone is not ill-disposed towards <==
     you, since they warn you of danger."

     "Or it may be that they wish, for their own purposes, to scare me
     away."

     human beings?"

     "Well, that is what we have to find out."

     "Whichever it is, my answer is fixed. There is no devil in hell, Mr.

     to the home of my own people, and you may take that to be my final
     answer." His dark brows knitted and his face flushed to a dusky red
     as he spoke. It was evident that the fiery temper of the Baskervilles
     was not extinct in this their last representative. "Meanwhile," said
     he, "I have hardly had time to think over all that you have told me.

     going back right away to my hotel. Suppose you and your friend, Dr.
     Watson, come round and lunch with us at two. I'll be able to tell you
     more clearly then how this thing strikes me."

     "Is that convenient to you, Watson?"

     "I'll join you in a walk, with pleasure," said his companion.

     "Then we meet again at two o'clock. Au revoir, and good-morning!"

     We heard the steps of our visitors descend the stair and the bang of
==>      the front door. In an instant Holmes had changed from the languid <==
     dreamer to the man of action.

     "Your hat and boots, Watson, quick! Not a moment to lose!" He rushed
     into his room in his dressing-gown and was back again in a few
     seconds in a frock-coat. We hurried together down the stairs and into

     is certainly a very fine morning for a walk."

     He quickened his pace until we had decreased the distance which
     divided us by about half. Then, still keeping a hundred yards behind,
     we followed into Oxford Street and so down Regent Street. Once our
==>      friends stopped and stared into a shop window, upon which Holmes did <==
     the same. An instant afterwards he gave a little cry of satisfaction,
     and, following the direction of his eager eyes, I saw that a hansom
     cab with a man inside which had halted on the other side of the
     street was now proceeding slowly onward again.

     if we can do no more."

     At that instant I was aware of a bushy black beard and a pair of
     piercing eyes turned upon us through the side window of the cab.
     Instantly the trapdoor at the top flew up, something was screamed to
==>      the driver, and the cab flew madly off down Regent Street. Holmes <==
     looked eagerly round for another, but no empty one was in sight. Then
     he dashed in wild pursuit amid the stream of the traffic, but the
     start was too great, and already the cab was out of sight.

     "There now!" said Holmes bitterly as he emerged panting and white

     the driver, and the cab flew madly off down Regent Street. Holmes
     looked eagerly round for another, but no empty one was in sight. Then
     he dashed in wild pursuit amid the stream of the traffic, but the
     start was too great, and already the cab was out of sight.

==>      "There now!" said Holmes bitterly as he emerged panting and white <==
     with vexation from the tide of vehicles. "Was ever such bad luck and
     such bad management, too? Watson, Watson, if you are an honest man
     you will record this also and set it against my successes!"

     "Who was the man?"

     We had been sauntering slowly down Regent Street during this
     conversation, and Dr. Mortimer, with his companion, had long vanished
     in front of us.

==>      "There is no object in our following them," said Holmes. "The shadow <==
     has departed and will not return. We must see what further cards we
     have in our hands and play them with decision. Could you swear to
     that man's face within the cab?"

     "I could swear only to the beard."

     A lad of fourteen, with a bright, keen face, had obeyed the summons
     of the manager. He stood now gazing with great reverence at the
     famous detective.

==>      "Let me have the Hotel Directory," said Holmes. "Thank you! Now, <==
     Cartwright, there are the names of twenty-three hotels here, all in
     the immediate neighbourhood of Charing Cross. Do you see?"

     "Yes, sir."

     Street picture galleries and fill in the time until we are due at the
     hotel."

     detaching his mind at will. For two hours the strange business in
     which we had been involved appeared to be forgotten, and he was
     entirely absorbed in the pictures of the modern Belgian masters. He
     would talk of nothing but art, of which he had the crudest ideas,

     Northumberland Hotel.

     "Sir Henry Baskerville is upstairs expecting you," said the clerk.
     "He asked me to show you up at once when you came."

==>      "Have you any objection to my looking at your register?" said Holmes. <==

     "Not in the least."

     The book showed that two names had been added after that of
     Baskerville. One was Theophilus Johnson and family, of Newcastle; the

     other Mrs. Oldmore and maid, of High Lodge, Alton.

     with a limp?"

     "No, sir; this is Mr. Johnson, the coal-owner, a very active

     missing boot there will be trouble. I can take a joke with the best,

     "Mind it is, for it's the last thing of mine that I'll lose in this

     "What do you make of it yourself?"

     "Well, I don't profess to understand it yet. This case of yours is
     very complex, Sir Henry. When taken in conjunction with your uncle's

     other of them guides us to the truth. We may waste time in following
     the wrong one, but sooner or later we must come upon the right."

     We had a pleasant luncheon in which little was said of the business
     which had brought us together. It was in the private sitting-room to

     "And when?"

     "At the end of the week."

==>      "On the whole," said Holmes, "I think that your decision is a wise <==
     one. I have ample evidence that you are being dogged in London, and
     amid the millions of this great city it is difficult to discover who
     these people are or what their object can be. If their intentions are
     evil they might do you a mischief, and we should be powerless to
     prevent it. You did not know, Dr. Mortimer, that you were followed

     as there are none of the family at the Hall these people have a
     mighty fine home and nothing to do."

     "That is true."

     "He and his wife had five hundred pounds each."

     "Ha! Did they know that they would receive this?"

     "And how much was the residue?"

     "Seven hundred and forty thousand pounds."

==>      Holmes raised his eyebrows in surprise. "I had no idea that so <==
     gigantic a sum was involved," said he.

     "Sir Charles had the reputation of being rich, but we did not know
     how very rich he was until we came to examine his securities. The
     total value of the estate was close on to a million."

     would also be the heir to the money unless it were willed otherwise
     by the present owner, who can, of course, do what he likes with it."

     "And have you made your will, Sir Henry?"

==>      "No, Mr. Holmes, I have not. I've had no time, for it was only <==
     yesterday that I learned how matters stood. But in any case I feel
     that the money should go with the title and estate. That was my poor
     uncle's idea. How is the owner going to restore the glories of the
     Baskervilles if he has not money enough to keep up the property?
     House, land, and dollars must go together."

     "If matters came to a crisis I should endeavour to be present in

     a disastrous scandal. You will see how impossible it is for me to go
     to Dartmoor."

     "Whom would you recommend, then?"

     how it is with me, and you know just as much about the matter as I
     do. If you will come down to Baskerville Hall and see me through I'll
     never forget it."

     The promise of adventure had always a fascination for me, and I was
==>      complimented by the words of Holmes and by the eagerness with which <==
     the baronet hailed me as a companion.

     "I will come, with pleasure," said I. "I do not know how I could

     "Would that suit Dr. Watson?"

     diving into one of the corners of the room he drew a brown boot from
     under a cabinet.

     "My missing boot!" he cried.

==>      "May all our difficulties vanish as easily!" said Sherlock Holmes. <==

     "But it is a very singular thing," Dr. Mortimer remarked. "I searched
     this room carefully before lunch."

     "And so did I," said Baskerville. "Every inch of it."

     which had succeeded each other so rapidly. Setting aside the whole
     grim story of Sir Charles's death, we had a line of inexplicable
     incidents all within the limits of two days, which included the
     receipt of the printed letter, the black-bearded spy in the hansom,
     the loss of the new brown boot, the loss of the old black boot, and
==>      now the return of the new brown boot. Holmes sat in silence in the <==
     cab as we drove back to Baker Street, and I knew from his drawn brows
     and keen face that his mind, like my own, was busy in endeavouring to
     frame some scheme into which all these strange and apparently
     disconnected episodes could be fitted. All afternoon and late into
     the evening he sat lost in tobacco and thought.

     Yard to ask you to your face what you had against me."

     "On the contrary, I have half a sovereign for you if you will give me
     a clear answer to my questions."

     "Well, I've had a good day and no mistake," said the cabman, with a

     "Did he say anything more?"

     mentioned?"

     burst into a hearty laugh.

     cabman's reply. For an instant he sat in silent amazement. Then he

     "A touch, Watson--an undeniable touch!" said he. "I feel a foil as

     what he wanted all day and ask no questions. I was glad enough to
     agree. First we drove down to the Northumberland Hotel and waited
     there until two gentlemen came out and took a cab from the rank. We
     followed their cab until it pulled up somewhere near here."

     "Well, I couldn't be sure of that, but I dare say my fare knew all
     about it. We pulled up half-way down the street and waited an hour

     easy gentleman to describe. I'd put him at forty years of age, and he
     was of a middle height, two or three inches shorter than you, sir. He
     was dressed like a toff, and he had a black beard, cut square at the

     of his shoulders and a rueful smile.

     "Snap goes our third thread, and we end where we began," said he.
     "The cunning rascal! He knew our number, knew that Sir Henry
     Baskerville had consulted me, spotted who I was in Regent Street,

     fellow, you may laugh, but I give you my word that I shall be very
     glad to have you back safe and sound in Baker Street once more."

     Sir Henry Baskerville and Dr. Mortimer were ready upon the appointed

     drove with me to the station and gave me his last parting injunctions
     and advice.

     Watson," said he; "I wish you simply to report facts in the fullest

     College of Surgeons."

     "And I went to look at the folk in the park," said Baskerville. "But
     we had no trouble of any kind."

==>      "It was imprudent, all the same," said Holmes, shaking his head and <==
     looking very grave. "I beg, Sir Henry, that you will not go about
     alone. Some great misfortune will befall you if you do. Did you get
     your other boot?"

     "No, sir, it is gone forever."

     of the phrases in that queer old legend which Dr. Mortimer has read

     of evil are exalted."

     I looked back at the platform when we had left it far behind, and saw

     after us.

     The journey was a swift and pleasant one, and I spent it in making
     the more intimate acquaintance of my two companions and in playing
     with Dr. Mortimer's spaniel. In a very few hours the brown earth had

     "Who is he, then?"

     an interest on account of the peculiar ferocity of the crime and the
     wanton brutality which had marked all the actions of the assassin.
     The commutation of his death sentence had been due to some doubts as
     to his complete sanity, so atrocious was his conduct. Our wagonette
     had topped a rise and in front of us rose the huge expanse of the

     had described a somewhat shorter man, but such an impression might
     easily have been erroneous. How could I settle the point forever?
     Obviously the first thing to do was to see the Grimpen postmaster,
     and find whether the test telegram had really been placed in
     Barrymore's own hands. Be the answer what it might, I should at least

     Sir Henry had numerous papers to examine after breakfast, so that the
     time was propitious for my excursion. It was a pleasant walk of four
     miles along the edge of the moor, leading me at last to a small gray
     hamlet, in which two larger buildings, which proved to be the inn and

     "Well, surely his own wife ought to know where he is," said the
     postmaster testily. "Didn't he get the telegram? If there is any
     mistake it is for Mr. Barrymore himself to complain."

     It seemed hopeless to pursue the inquiry any farther, but it was
==>      clear that in spite of Holmes's ruse we had no proof that Barrymore <==
     had not been in London all the time. Suppose that it were so--suppose
     that the same man had been the last who had seen Sir Charles alive,
     and the first to dog the new heir when he returned to England. What
     then? Was he the agent of others or had he some sinister design of
     his own? What interest could he have in persecuting the Baskerville

     conceivable motive was that which had been suggested by Sir Henry,
     that if the family could be scared away a comfortable and permanent
     home would be secured for the Barrymores. But surely such an
     explanation as that would be quite inadequate to account for the deep
     and subtle scheming which seemed to be weaving an invisible net round

     had come to him in all the long series of his sensational
     investigations. I prayed, as I walked back along the gray, lonely
     road, that my friend might soon be freed from his preoccupations and
     able to come down to take this heavy burden of responsibility from my
     shoulders.

     was littered. It was certain that I could not help with those. And

     the path.

     "Perhaps then he pays a visit every night to that particular window,"
     I suggested.

     "Perhaps he does. If so, we should be able to shadow him, and see
==>      what it is that he is after. I wonder what your friend Holmes would <==
     do, if he were here."

     "I believe that he would do exactly what you now suggest," said I.
     "He would follow Barrymore and see what he did."

     "That depends on whether you are going on the moor," said I.

     "Yes, I am."

     "Well, you know what my instructions are. I am sorry to intrude, but
==>      you heard how earnestly Holmes insisted that I should not leave you, <==
     and especially that you should not go alone upon the moor."

     Sir Henry put his hand upon my shoulder with a pleasant smile.

     "My dear fellow," said he, "Holmes, with all his wisdom, did not

     you heard how earnestly Holmes insisted that I should not leave you,
     and especially that you should not go alone upon the moor."

     Sir Henry put his hand upon my shoulder with a pleasant smile.

==>      "My dear fellow," said he, "Holmes, with all his wisdom, did not <==
     foresee some things which have happened since I have been on the
     moor. You understand me? I am sure that you are the last man in the
     world who would wish to be a spoil-sport. I must go out alone."

     It put me in a most awkward position. I was at a loss what to say or

     suitor--even when that suitor was so eligible a one as Sir Henry. And
     now I pass on to another thread which I have extricated out of the
     tangled skein, the mystery of the sobs in the night, of the
     tear-stained face of Mrs. Barrymore, of the secret journey of the
     butler to the western lattice window. Congratulate me, my dear
==>      Holmes, and tell me that I have not disappointed you as an <==
     agent--that you do not regret the confidence which you showed in me
     when you sent me down. All these things have by one night's work been
     thoroughly cleared.

     I have said "by one night's work," but, in truth, it was by two

     "We must close in on him rapidly, for he is said to be a desperate
     fellow. We shall take him by surprise and have him at our mercy
     before he can resist."

==>      "I say, Watson," said the baronet, "what would Holmes say to this? <==
     How about that hour of darkness in which the power of evil is
     exalted?"

     As if in answer to his words there rose suddenly out of the vast
     gloom of the moor that strange cry which I had already heard upon the

[line number in individual story] matching line = 4026    window = 4021 4031

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 48358    window = 48353 48363


     unexpected thing. We had risen from our rocks and were turning to go
     home, having abandoned the hopeless chase. The moon was low upon the
     right, and the jagged pinnacle of a granite tor stood up against the
     lower curve of its silver disc. There, outlined as black as an ebony
     statue on that shining back-ground, I saw the figure of a man upon
==>      the tor. Do not think that it was a delusion, Holmes. I assure you <==
     that I have never in my life seen anything more clearly. As far as I
     could judge, the figure was that of a tall, thin man. He stood with
     his legs a little separated, his arms folded, his head bowed, as if
     he were brooding over that enormous wilderness of peat and granite
     which lay before him. He might have been the very spirit of that

     escaped." Well, perhaps his explanation may be the right one, but I
     should like to have some further proof of it. To-day we mean to
     communicate to the Princetown people where they should look for their
     missing man, but it is hard lines that we have not actually had the
     triumph of bringing him back as our own prisoner. Such are the
==>      adventures of last night, and you must acknowledge, my dear Holmes, <==
     that I have done you very well in the matter of a report. Much of
     what I tell you is no doubt quite irrelevant, but still I feel that
     it is best that I should let you have all the facts and leave you to
     select for yourself those which will be of most service to you in
     helping you to your conclusions. We are certainly making some

     light upon this also. Best of all would it be if you could come down
     to us. In any case you will hear from me again in the course of the
     next few days.

     So far I have been able to quote from the reports which I have
==>      forwarded during these early days to Sherlock Holmes. Now, however, I <==
     have arrived at a point in my narrative where I am compelled to
     abandon this method and to trust once more to my recollections, aided
     by the diary which I kept at the time. A few extracts from the latter
     will carry me on to those scenes which are indelibly fixed in every
     detail upon my memory. I proceed, then, from the morning which

[line number in individual story] matching line = 4101    window = 4096 4106

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 48433    window = 48428 48438


     Stapleton may fall in with such a superstition, and Mortimer also;
     but if I have one quality upon earth it is common-sense, and nothing
     will persuade me to believe in such a thing. To do so would be to
     descend to the level of these poor peasants, who are not content with
     a mere fiend dog but must needs describe him with hell-fire shooting
==>      from his mouth and eyes. Holmes would not listen to such fancies, and <==
     I am his agent. But facts are facts, and I have twice heard this
     crying upon the moor. Suppose that there were really some huge hound
     loose upon it; that would go far to explain everything. But where
     could such a hound lie concealed, where did it get its food, where
     did it come from, how was it that no one saw it by day? It must be

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 48616    window = 48611 48621


     "So I think. But if we can only trace L. L. it should clear up the
     whole business. We have gained that much. We know that there is
     someone who has the facts if we can only find her. What do you think
     we should do?"

==>      "Let Holmes know all about it at once. It will give him the clue for <==
     which he has been seeking. I am much mistaken if it does not bring
     him down."

     I went at once to my room and drew up my report of the morning's
     conversation for Holmes. It was evident to me that he had been very

[line number in individual story] matching line = 4289    window = 4284 4294

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 48621    window = 48616 48626


     "Let Holmes know all about it at once. It will give him the clue for
     which he has been seeking. I am much mistaken if it does not bring
     him down."

     I went at once to my room and drew up my report of the morning's
==>      conversation for Holmes. It was evident to me that he had been very <==
     busy of late, for the notes which I had from Baker Street were few
     and short, with no comments upon the information which I had supplied
     and hardly any reference to my mission. No doubt his blackmailing
     case is absorbing all his faculties. And yet this new factor must
     surely arrest his attention and renew his interest. I wish that he

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 48713    window = 48708 48718


     made towards clearing one incident in this chain of mysteries. I am
     certainly developing the wisdom of the serpent, for when Mortimer
     pressed his questions to an inconvenient extent I asked him casually
     to what type Frankland's skull belonged, and so heard nothing but
     craniology for the rest of our drive. I have not lived for years with
==>      Sherlock Holmes for nothing. <==

     I have only one other incident to record upon this tempestuous and
     melancholy day. This was my conversation with Barrymore just now,
     which gives me one more strong card which I can play in due time.


[line number in individual story] matching line = 4750    window = 4745 4755

     find out from his own lips, at the point of my revolver if necessary,
     who he was and why he had dogged us so long. He might slip away from
     us in the crowd of Regent Street, but it would puzzle him to do so
     upon the lonely moor. On the other hand, if I should find the hut and
     its tenant should not be within it I must remain there, however long
==>      the vigil, until he returned. Holmes had missed him in London. It <==
     would indeed be a triumph for me if I could run him to earth, where
     my master had failed.

     Luck had been against us again and again in this inquiry, but now at
     last it came to my aid. And the messenger of good fortune was none

     Then my senses and my voice came back to me, while a crushing weight
     of responsibility seemed in an instant to be lifted from my soul.
     That cold, incisive, ironical voice could belong to but one man in
     all the world.

==>      "Holmes!" I cried--"Holmes!" <==

     "Come out," said he, "and please be careful with the revolver."

     I stooped under the rude lintel, and there he sat upon a stone
     outside, his gray eyes dancing with amusement as they fell upon my

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 49429    window = 49424 49434



     "That was what I wished you to think."

     "Then you use me, and yet do not trust me!" I cried with some
     bitterness. "I think that I have deserved better at your hands,
==>      Holmes." <==

     "My dear fellow, you have been invaluable to me in this as in many
     other cases, and I beg that you will forgive me if I have seemed to
     play a trick upon you. In truth, it was partly for your own sake that
     I did it, and it was my appreciation of the danger which you ran

[line number in individual story] matching line = 5125    window = 5120 5130

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 49457    window = 49452 49462


     very active pair of feet, and both have been invaluable."

     "Then my reports have all been wasted!"--My voice trembled as I
     recalled the pains and the pride with which I had composed them.

==>      Holmes took a bundle of papers from his pocket. <==

     "Here are your reports, my dear fellow, and very well thumbed, I
     assure you. I made excellent arrangements, and they are only delayed
     one day upon their way. I must compliment you exceedingly upon the
     zeal and the intelligence which you have shown over an

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 49466    window = 49461 49471


     one day upon their way. I must compliment you exceedingly upon the
     zeal and the intelligence which you have shown over an
     extraordinarily difficult case."

     I was still rather raw over the deception which had been practised
==>      upon me, but the warmth of Holmes's praise drove my anger from my <==
     mind. I felt also in my heart that he was right in what he said and
     that it was really best for our purpose that I should not have known
     that he was upon the moor.

     "That's better," said he, seeing the shadow rise from my face. "And

[line number in individual story] matching line = 5149    window = 5144 5154

     gone to-day it is exceedingly probable that I should have gone
     to-morrow."

     The sun had set and dusk was settling over the moor. The air had
     turned chill and we withdrew into the hut for warmth. There, sitting
==>      together in the twilight, I told Holmes of my conversation with the <==
     lady. So interested was he that I had to repeat some of it twice
     before he was satisfied.

     "This is most important," said he when I had concluded. "It fills up
     a gap which I had been unable to bridge, in this most complex affair.

     "I am giving you some information now, in return for all that you
     have given me. The lady who has passed here as Miss Stapleton is in
     reality his wife."

==>      "Good heavens, Holmes! Are you sure of what you say? How could he <==
     have permitted Sir Henry to fall in love with her?"

     "Sir Henry's falling in love could do no harm to anyone except Sir
     Henry. He took particular care that Sir Henry did not make love to
     her, as you have yourself observed. I repeat that the lady is his

     "Exactly."

     The shape of some monstrous villainy, half seen, half guessed, loomed
     through the darkness which had girt me so long.

==>      "But are you sure of this, Holmes? How do you know that the woman is <==
     his wife?"

     "Because he so far forgot himself as to tell you a true piece of
     autobiography upon the occasion when he first met you, and I dare say
     he has many a time regretted it since. He was once a schoolmaster in

     Baskerville Hall."

     The last red streaks had faded away in the west and night had settled
     upon the moor. A few faint stars were gleaming in a violet sky.

==>      "One last question, Holmes," I said, as I rose. "Surely there is no <==
     need of secrecy between you and me. What is the meaning of it all?
     What is he after?"

     Holmes's voice sank as he answered:--


[line number in individual story] matching line = 5241    window = 5236 5246

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 49573    window = 49568 49578



     "One last question, Holmes," I said, as I rose. "Surely there is no

     "It is murder, Watson--refined, cold-blooded, deliberate murder. Do
     not ask me for particulars. My nets are closing upon him, even as his
     are upon Sir Henry, and with your help he is already almost at my
     mercy. There is but one danger which can threaten us. It is that he

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 49591    window = 49586 49596


     of the silence of the moor. That frightful cry turned the blood to
     ice in my veins.

     "Oh, my God!" I gasped. "What is it? What does it mean?"

==>      Holmes had sprung to his feet, and I saw his dark, athletic outline <==
     at the door of the hut, his shoulders stooping, his head thrust
     forward, his face peering into the darkness.

     "Hush!" he whispered. "Hush!"


[line number in individual story] matching line = 5269    window = 5264 5274

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 49601    window = 49596 49606



     The cry had been loud on account of its vehemence, but it had pealed
     out from somewhere far off on the shadowy plain. Now it burst upon
     our ears, nearer, louder, more urgent than before.

==>      "Where is it?" Holmes whispered; and I knew from the thrill of his <==
     voice that he, the man of iron, was shaken to the soul. "Where is it,
     Watson?"

     "There, I think." I pointed into the darkness.


[line number in individual story] matching line = 5282    window = 5277 5287

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 49614    window = 49609 49619


     Again the agonized cry swept through the silent night, louder and
     much nearer than ever. And a new sound mingled with it, a deep,
     muttered rumble, musical and yet menacing, rising and falling like
     the low, constant murmur of the sea.

==>      "The hound!" cried Holmes. "Come, Watson, come! Great heavens, if we <==
     are too late!"

     He had started running swiftly over the moor, and I had followed at
     his heels. But now from somewhere among the broken ground immediately
     in front of us there came one last despairing yell, and then a dull,

[line number in individual story] matching line = 5291    window = 5286 5296

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 49623    window = 49618 49628


     his heels. But now from somewhere among the broken ground immediately
     in front of us there came one last despairing yell, and then a dull,
     heavy thud. We halted and listened. Not another sound broke the heavy
     silence of the windless night.

==>      I saw Holmes put his hand to his forehead like a man distracted. He <==
     stamped his feet upon the ground.

     "He has beaten us, Watson. We are too late."

     "No, no, surely not!"

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 49637    window = 49632 49642


     we'll avenge him!"

     Blindly we ran through the gloom, blundering against boulders,
     forcing our way through gorse bushes, panting up hills and rushing
     down slopes, heading always in the direction whence those dreadful
==>      sounds had come. At every rise Holmes looked eagerly round him, but <==
     the shadows were thick upon the moor, and nothing moved upon its
     dreary face.

     "Can you see anything?"


[line number in individual story] matching line = 5325    window = 5320 5330

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 49657    window = 49652 49662


     upon the ground, the head doubled under him at a horrible angle, the
     shoulders rounded and the body hunched together as if in the act of
     throwing a somersault. So grotesque was the attitude that I could not
     for the instant realize that that moan had been the passing of his
     soul. Not a whisper, not a rustle, rose now from the dark figure over
==>      which we stooped. Holmes laid his hand upon him, and held it up <==
     again, with an exclamation of horror. The gleam of the match which he
     struck shone upon his clotted fingers and upon the ghastly pool which
     widened slowly from the crushed skull of the victim. And it shone
     upon something else which turned our hearts sick and faint within
     us--the body of Sir Henry Baskerville!

     There was no chance of either of us forgetting that peculiar ruddy
     tweed suit--the very one which he had worn on the first morning that
     we had seen him in Baker Street. We caught the one clear glimpse of
     it, and then the match flickered and went out, even as the hope had
==>      gone out of our souls. Holmes groaned, and his face glimmered white <==
     through the darkness.

     "The brute! the brute!" I cried with clenched hands. "Oh Holmes, I
     shall never forgive myself for having left him to his fate."


[line number in individual story] matching line = 5339    window = 5334 5344

     we had seen him in Baker Street. We caught the one clear glimpse of
     it, and then the match flickered and went out, even as the hope had

     "I am more to blame than you, Watson. In order to have my case well

     the greatest blow which has befallen me in my career. But how could I

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 49721    window = 49716 49726


     Together we made our way down the precipitous slope and approached
     the body, black and clear against the silvered stones. The agony of
     those contorted limbs struck me with a spasm of pain and blurred my
     eyes with tears.

==>      "We must send for help, Holmes! We cannot carry him all the way to <==
     the Hall. Good heavens, are you mad?"

     He had uttered a cry and bent over the body. Now he was dancing and
     laughing and wringing my hand. Could this be my stern, self-contained
     friend? These were hidden fires, indeed!

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 49745    window = 49740 49750


     Then in an instant it was all clear to me. I remembered how the
     baronet had told me that he had handed his old wardrobe to Barrymore.
     Barrymore had passed it on in order to help Selden in his escape.
     Boots, shirt, cap--it was all Sir Henry's. The tragedy was still
     black enough, but this man had at least deserved death by the laws of
==>      his country. I told Holmes how the matter stood, my heart bubbling <==
     over with thankfulness and joy.

     "Then the clothes have been the poor devil's death," said he. "It is
     clear enough that the hound has been laid on from some article of Sir
     Henry's--the boot which was abstracted in the hotel, in all

     "It is Selden, the man who escaped from Princetown."

     Stapleton turned a ghastly face upon us, but by a supreme effort he
     had overcome his amazement and his disappointment. He looked sharply
==>      from Holmes to me. <==

     "Dear me! What a very shocking affair! How did he die?"

     "He appears to have broken his neck by falling over these rocks. My
     friend and I were strolling on the moor when we heard a cry."

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 49818    window = 49813 49823


     "Why about Sir Henry in particular?" I could not help asking.

     "Because I had suggested that he should come over. When he did not
     come I was surprised, and I naturally became alarmed for his safety
     when I heard cries upon the moor. By the way"--his eyes darted again
==>      from my face to Holmes's--"did you hear anything else besides a cry?" <==

     "No," said Holmes; "did you?"

     "No."

     "Because I had suggested that he should come over. When he did not
     come I was surprised, and I naturally became alarmed for his safety
     when I heard cries upon the moor. By the way"--his eyes darted again
     from my face to Holmes's--"did you hear anything else besides a cry?"

==>      "No," said Holmes; "did you?" <==

     "No."

     "What do you mean, then?"

     head. He has rushed about the moor in a crazy state and eventually
     fallen over here and broken his neck."

     "That seems the most reasonable theory," said Stapleton, and he gave
     a sigh which I took to indicate his relief. "What do you think about
==>      it, Mr. Sherlock Holmes?" <==

     My friend bowed his compliments.

     "You are quick at identification," said he.

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 49860    window = 49855 49865


     "That is my intention."

     "I hope your visit has cast some light upon those occurrences which
     have puzzled us?"

==>      Holmes shrugged his shoulders. <==

     "One cannot always have the success for which one hopes. An
     investigator needs facts, and not legends or rumours. It has not been
     a satisfactory case."

     give my sister such a fright that I do not feel justified in doing
     it. I think that if we put something over his face he will be safe
     until morning."

     And so it was arranged. Resisting Stapleton's offer of hospitality,
==>      Holmes and I set off to Baskerville Hall, leaving the naturalist to <==
     return alone. Looking back we saw the figure moving slowly away over
     the broad moor, and behind him that one black smudge on the silvered
     slope which showed where the man was lying who had come so horribly
     to his end.

     return alone. Looking back we saw the figure moving slowly away over
     the broad moor, and behind him that one black smudge on the silvered
     slope which showed where the man was lying who had come so horribly
     to his end.

==>      "We're at close grips at last," said Holmes as we walked together <==
     across the moor. "What a nerve the fellow has! How he pulled himself
     together in the face of what must have been a paralyzing shock when
     he found that the wrong man had fallen a victim to his plot. I told
     you in London, Watson, and I tell you now again, that we have never
     had a foeman more worthy of our steel."

     "Then you must excuse yourself and he must go alone. That will be
     easily arranged. And now, if we are too late for dinner, I think that
     we are both ready for our suppers."

==>      Sir Henry was more pleased than surprised to see Sherlock Holmes, for <==
     he had for some days been expecting that recent events would bring
     him down from London. He did raise his eyebrows, however, when he
     found that my friend had neither any luggage nor any explanations for
     its absence. Between us we soon supplied his wants, and then over a
     belated supper we explained to the baronet as much of our experience

     have kept my promise. If I hadn't sworn not to go about alone I might
     have had a more lively evening, for I had a message from Stapleton
     asking me over there."

     "I have no doubt that you would have had a more lively evening," said
==>      Holmes drily. "By the way, I don't suppose you appreciate that we <==
     have been mourning over you as having broken your neck?"

     Sir Henry opened his eyes. "How was that?"

     "This poor wretch was dressed in your clothes. I fear your servant

     mischief, the wicked Hugo, who started the Hound of the Baskervilles.
     We're not likely to forget him."

     I gazed with interest and some surprise upon the portrait.

==>      "Dear me!" said Holmes, "he seems a quiet, meek-mannered man enough, <==
     but I dare say that there was a lurking devil in his eyes. I had
     pictured him as a more robust and ruffianly person."

     "There's no doubt about the authenticity, for the name and the date,
     1647, are on the back of the canvas."

     pictured him as a more robust and ruffianly person."

     "There's no doubt about the authenticity, for the name and the date,
     1647, are on the back of the canvas."

==>      Holmes said little more, but the picture of the old roysterer seemed <==
     to have a fascination for him, and his eyes were continually fixed
     upon it during supper. It was not until later, when Sir Henry had
     gone to his room, that I was able to follow the trend of his
     thoughts. He led me back into the banqueting-hall, his bedroom candle
     in his hand, and he held it up against the time-stained portrait on

     card, and we add him to the Baker Street collection!" He burst into
     one of his rare fits of laughter as he turned away from the picture.
     I have not heard him laugh often, and it has always boded ill to
     somebody.

==>      I was up betimes in the morning, but Holmes was afoot earlier still, <==
     for I saw him as I dressed, coming up the drive.

     "Yes, we should have a full day to-day," he remarked, and he rubbed
     his hands with the joy of action. "The nets are all in place, and the
     drag is about to begin. We'll know before the day is out whether we

     "What is the next move?"

     "To see Sir Henry. Ah, here he is!"

==>      "Good morning, Holmes," said the baronet. "You look like a general <==
     who is planning a battle with his chief of the staff."

     "That is the exact situation. Watson was asking for orders."

     "And so do I."

     "Very good. I should be glad to get away as soon after breakfast as
     possible, so as to reach London in the afternoon."

     I was much astounded by this programme, though I remembered that
==>      Holmes had said to Stapleton on the night before that his visit would <==
     terminate next day. It had not crossed my mind, however, that he
     would wish me to go with him, nor could I understand how we could
     both be absent at a moment which he himself declared to be critical.
     There was nothing for it, however, but implicit obedience; so we bade
     good-bye to our rueful friend, and a couple of hours afterwards we

     "Yes, sir."

     "And ask at the station office if there is a message for me."

==>      The boy returned with a telegram, which Holmes handed to me. It ran: <==

     Lestrade.

     "That is in answer to mine of this morning. He is the best of the

     be needed. That telegram from London, if mentioned by Sir Henry to
     the Stapletons, must remove the last suspicions from their minds.
     Already I seemed to see our nets drawing closer around that
     lean-jawed pike.

==>      Mrs. Laura Lyons was in her office, and Sherlock Holmes opened his <==
     interview with a frankness and directness which considerably amazed
     her.

     "I am investigating the circumstances which attended the death of the
     late Sir Charles Baskerville," said he. "My friend here, Dr. Watson,

     pressure of her grip.

     "His wife!" she said again. "His wife! He is not a married man."

==>      Sherlock Holmes shrugged his shoulders. <==

     "Prove it to me! Prove it to me! And if you can do so--!" The fierce
     flash of her eyes said more than any words.

     "I have come prepared to do so," said Holmes, drawing several papers

[line number in individual story] matching line = 5982    window = 5977 5987

     Sherlock Holmes shrugged his shoulders.

     "Prove it to me! Prove it to me! And if you can do so--!" The fierce
     flash of her eyes said more than any words.

==>      "I have come prepared to do so," said Holmes, drawing several papers <==
     from his pocket. "Here is a photograph of the couple taken in York
     four years ago. It is indorsed 'Mr. and Mrs. Vandeleur,' but you will
     have no difficulty in recognizing him, and her also, if you know her
     by sight. Here are three written descriptions by trustworthy
     witnesses of Mr. and Mrs. Vandeleur, who at that time kept St.

     identity of these people."

     She glanced at them, and then looked up at us with the set, rigid
     face of a desperate woman.

==>      "Mr. Holmes," she said, "this man had offered me marriage on <==
     condition that I could get a divorce from my husband. He has lied to
     me, the villain, in every conceivable way. Not one word of truth has
     he ever told me. And why--why? I imagined that all was for my own
     sake. But now I see that I was never anything but a tool in his
     hands. Why should I preserve faith with him who never kept any with

     wicked acts? Ask me what you like, and there is nothing which I shall
     hold back. One thing I swear to you, and that is that when I wrote
     the letter I never dreamed of any harm to the old gentleman, who had
     been my kindest friend."

==>      "I entirely believe you, madam," said Sherlock Holmes. "The recital <==
     of these events must be very painful to you, and perhaps it will make
     it easier if I tell you what occurred, and you can check me if I make
     any material mistake. The sending of this letter was suggested to you
     by Stapleton?"

     "I knew him," she said. "But if he had kept faith with me I should
     always have done so with him."

     "I think that on the whole you have had a fortunate escape," said
==>      Sherlock Holmes. "You have had him in your power and he knew it, and <==
     yet you are alive. You have been walking for some months very near to
     the edge of a precipice. We must wish you good-morning now, Mrs.
     Lyons, and it is probable that you will very shortly hear from us
     again."

     the edge of a precipice. We must wish you good-morning now, Mrs.
     Lyons, and it is probable that you will very shortly hear from us
     again."

     "Our case becomes rounded off, and difficulty after difficulty thins
==>      away in front of us," said Holmes as we stood waiting for the arrival <==
     of the express from town. "I shall soon be in the position of being
     able to put into a single connected narrative one of the most
     singular and sensational crimes of modern times. Students of
     criminology will remember the analogous incidents in Godno, in Little
     Russia, in the year '66, and of course there are the Anderson murders

     the scorn which the theories of the reasoner used then to excite in
     the practical man.

     "Anything good?" he asked.

==>      "The biggest thing for years," said Holmes. "We have two hours before <==
     we need think of starting. I think we might employ it in getting some
     dinner and then, Lestrade, we will take the London fog out of your
     throat by giving you a breath of the pure night air of Dartmoor.
     Never been there? Ah, well, I don't suppose you will forget your
     first visit."

==>      One of Sherlock Holmes's defects--if, indeed, one may call it a <==
     defect--was that he was exceedingly loath to communicate his full
     plans to any other person until the instant of their fulfilment.
     Partly it came no doubt from his own masterful nature, which loved to
     dominate and surprise those who were around him. Partly also from his
     professional caution, which urged him never to take any chances. The

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 50424    window = 50419 50429


     professional caution, which urged him never to take any chances. The
     result, however, was very trying for those who were acting as his
     agents and assistants. I had often suffered under it, but never more
     so than during that long drive in the darkness. The great ordeal was
     in front of us; at last we were about to make our final effort, and
==>      yet Holmes had said nothing, and I could only surmise what his course <==
     of action would be. My nerves thrilled with anticipation when at last
     the cold wind upon our faces and the dark, void spaces on either side
     of the narrow road told me that we were back upon the moor once
     again. Every stride of the horses and every turn of the wheels was
     taking us nearer to our supreme adventure.

     "As long as I have my trousers I have a hip-pocket, and as long as I

     "Good! My friend and I are also ready for emergencies."

     now?"

     "A waiting game."

     "My word, it does not seem a very cheerful place," said the detective

     "That is Merripit House and the end of our journey. I must request
     you to walk on tiptoe and not to talk above a whisper."

     We moved cautiously along the track as if we were bound for the
==>      house, but Holmes halted us when we were about two hundred yards from <==
     it.

     "This will do," said he. "These rocks upon the right make an
     admirable screen."

     from within. He was only a minute or so inside, and then I heard the
     key turn once more and he passed me and re-entered the house. I saw
     him rejoin his guest, and I crept quietly back to where my companions
     were waiting to tell them what I had seen.

==>      "You say, Watson, that the lady is not there?" Holmes asked, when I <==
     had finished my report.

     "No."

     "Where can she be, then, since there is no light in any other room

     I have said that over the great Grimpen Mire there hung a dense,
     white fog. It was drifting slowly in our direction, and banked itself
     up like a wall on that side of us, low, but thick and well defined.
     The moon shone on it, and it looked like a great shimmering
     ice-field, with the heads of the distant tors as rocks borne upon its
==>      surface. Holmes's face was turned towards it, and he muttered <==
     impatiently as he watched its sluggish drift.

     "It's moving towards us, Watson."

     "Is that serious?"

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 50554    window = 50549 50559


     thin wisps of it were curling across the golden square of the lighted
     window. The farther wall of the orchard was already invisible, and
     the trees were standing out of a swirl of white vapour. As we watched
     it the fog-wreaths came crawling round both corners of the house and
     rolled slowly into one dense bank, on which the upper floor and the
==>      roof floated like a strange ship upon a shadowy sea. Holmes struck <==
     his hand passionately upon the rock in front of us and stamped his
     feet in his impatience.

     "If he isn't out in a quarter of an hour the path will be covered. In
     half an hour we won't be able to see our hands in front of us."

[line number in individual story] matching line = 6237    window = 6232 6242

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 50569    window = 50564 50574



     So as the fog-bank flowed onward we fell back before it until we were
     half a mile from the house, and still that dense white sea, with the
     moon silvering its upper edge, swept slowly and inexorably on.

==>      "We are going too far," said Holmes. "We dare not take the chance of <==
     his being overtaken before he can reach us. At all costs we must hold
     our ground where we are." He dropped on his knees and clapped his ear
     to the ground. "Thank God, I think that I hear him coming."

     A sound of quick steps broke the silence of the moor. Crouching among

[line number in individual story] matching line = 6251    window = 6246 6256

     surprise as he emerged into the clear, starlit night. Then he came
     swiftly along the path, passed close to where we lay, and went on up
     the long slope behind us. As he walked he glanced continually over
     either shoulder, like a man who is ill at ease.

==>      "Hist!" cried Holmes, and I heard the sharp click of a cocking <==
     pistol. "Look out! It's coming!"

     There was a thin, crisp, continuous patter from somewhere in the
     heart of that crawling bank. The cloud was within fifty yards of
     where we lay, and we glared at it, all three, uncertain what horror

[line number in individual story] matching line = 6257    window = 6252 6262

     pistol. "Look out! It's coming!"

     There was a thin, crisp, continuous patter from somewhere in the
     heart of that crawling bank. The cloud was within fifty yards of
     where we lay, and we glared at it, all three, uncertain what horror
==>      was about to break from the heart of it. I was at Holmes's elbow, and <==
     I glanced for an instant at his face. It was pale and exultant, his
     eyes shining brightly in the moonlight. But suddenly they started
     forward in a rigid, fixed stare, and his lips parted in amazement. At
     the same instant Lestrade gave a yell of terror and threw himself
     face downward upon the ground. I sprang to my feet, my inert hand

[line number in individual story] matching line = 6276    window = 6271 6281

     wall of fog.

     With long bounds the huge black creature was leaping down the track,
     following hard upon the footsteps of our friend. So paralyzed were we
     by the apparition that we allowed him to pass before we had recovered
==>      our nerve. Then Holmes and I both fired together, and the creature <==
     gave a hideous howl, which showed that one at least had hit him. He
     did not pause, however, but bounded onward. Far away on the path we
     saw Sir Henry looking back, his face white in the moonlight, his
     hands raised in horror, glaring helplessly at the frightful thing
     which was hunting him down.

[line number in individual story] matching line = 6285    window = 6280 6290

     hands raised in horror, glaring helplessly at the frightful thing
     which was hunting him down.

     But that cry of pain from the hound had blown all our fears to the
     winds. If he was vulnerable he was mortal, and if we could wound him
==>      we could kill him. Never have I seen a man run as Holmes ran that <==
     night. I am reckoned fleet of foot, but he outpaced me as much as I
     outpaced the little professional. In front of us as we flew up the
     track we heard scream after scream from Sir Henry and the deep roar
     of the hound. I was in time to see the beast spring upon its victim,
     hurl him to the ground, and worry at his throat. But the next instant

     outpaced the little professional. In front of us as we flew up the
     track we heard scream after scream from Sir Henry and the deep roar
     of the hound. I was in time to see the beast spring upon its victim,
     hurl him to the ground, and worry at his throat. But the next instant
==>      Holmes had emptied five barrels of his revolver into the creature's <==
     flank. With a last howl of agony and a vicious snap in the air, it
     rolled upon its back, four feet pawing furiously, and then fell limp
     upon its side. I stooped, panting, and pressed my pistol to the
     dreadful, shimmering head, but it was useless to press the trigger.

     upon its side. I stooped, panting, and pressed my pistol to the
     dreadful, shimmering head, but it was useless to press the trigger.
     The giant hound was dead.

     Sir Henry lay insensible where he had fallen. We tore away his
==>      collar, and Holmes breathed a prayer of gratitude when we saw that <==
     there was no sign of a wound and that the rescue had been in time.
     Already our friend's eyelids shivered and he made a feeble effort to
     move. Lestrade thrust his brandy-flask between the baronet's teeth,
     and two frightened eyes were looking up at us.

     and two frightened eyes were looking up at us.

     "My God!" he whispered. "What was it? What, in heaven's name, was
     it?"

==>      "It's dead, whatever it is," said Holmes. "We've laid the family <==
     ghost once and forever."

     In mere size and strength it was a terrible creature which was lying
     stretched before us. It was not a pure bloodhound and it was not a
     pure mastiff; but it appeared to be a combination of the two--gaunt,

     hand upon the glowing muzzle, and as I held them up my own fingers
     smouldered and gleamed in the darkness.

     "Phosphorus," I said.

==>      "A cunning preparation of it," said Holmes, sniffing at the dead <==
     animal. "There is no smell which might have interfered with his power
     of scent. We owe you a deep apology, Sir Henry, for having exposed
     you to this fright. I was prepared for a hound, but not for such a
     creature as this. And the fog gave us little time to receive him."

     He tried to stagger to his feet; but he was still ghastly pale and
     trembling in every limb. We helped him to a rock, where he sat
     shivering with his face buried in his hands.

==>      "We must leave you now," said Holmes. "The rest of our work must be <==
     done, and every moment is of importance. We have our case, and now we
     only want our man.

     "It's a thousand to one against our finding him at the house," he
     continued as we retraced our steps swiftly down the path. "Those

     No, no, he's gone by this time! But we'll search the house and make
     sure."

     The front door was open, so we rushed in and hurried from room to
     room to the amazement of a doddering old manservant, who met us in
==>      the passage. There was no light save in the dining-room, but Holmes <==
     caught up the lamp and left no corner of the house unexplored. No
     sign could we see of the man whom we were chasing. On the upper
     floor, however, one of the bedroom doors was locked.

     "There's someone in here," cried Lestrade. "I can hear a movement.

     floor, however, one of the bedroom doors was locked.

     "There's someone in here," cried Lestrade. "I can hear a movement.
     Open this door!"

==>      A faint moaning and rustling came from within. Holmes struck the door <==
     just over the lock with the flat of his foot and it flew open. Pistol
     in hand, we all three rushed into the room.

     But there was no sign within it of that desperate and defiant villain
     whom we expected to see. Instead we were faced by an object so

[line number in individual story] matching line = 6394    window = 6389 6399

     us. In a minute we had torn off the gag, unswathed the bonds, and
     Mrs. Stapleton sank upon the floor in front of us. As her beautiful
     head fell upon her chest I saw the clear red weal of a whiplash
     across her neck.

==>      "The brute!" cried Holmes. "Here, Lestrade, your brandy-bottle! Put <==
     her in the chair! She has fainted from ill-usage and exhaustion."

     She opened her eyes again.

     "Is he safe?" she asked. "Has he escaped?"

[line number in individual story] matching line = 6422    window = 6417 6427

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 50754    window = 50749 50759


     it all, ill-usage, solitude, a life of deception, everything, as long
     as I could still cling to the hope that I had his love, but now I
     know that in this also I have been his dupe and his tool." She broke
     into passionate sobbing as she spoke.

==>      "You bear him no good will, madam," said Holmes. "Tell us then where <==
     we shall find him. If you have ever aided him in evil, help us now
     and so atone."

     "There is but one place where he can have fled," she answered. "There
     is an old tin mine on an island in the heart of the mire. It was

     "There is but one place where he can have fled," she answered. "There
     is an old tin mine on an island in the heart of the mire. It was
     there that he kept his hound and there also he had made preparations
     so that he might have a refuge. That is where he would fly."

==>      The fog-bank lay like white wool against the window. Holmes held the <==
     lamp towards it.

     "See," said he. "No one could find his way into the Grimpen Mire
     to-night."


[line number in individual story] matching line = 6447    window = 6442 6452

     mark the pathway through the mire. Oh, if I could only have plucked
     them out to-day. Then indeed you would have had him at your mercy!"

     It was evident to us that all pursuit was in vain until the fog had
     lifted. Meanwhile we left Lestrade in possession of the house while
==>      Holmes and I went back with the baronet to Baskerville Hall. The <==
     story of the Stapletons could no longer be withheld from him, but he
     took the blow bravely when he learned the truth about the woman whom
     he had loved. But the shock of the night's adventures had shattered
     his nerves, and before morning he lay delirious in a high fever,
     under the care of Dr. Mortimer. The two of them were destined to

     feet. Its tenacious grip plucked at our heels as we walked, and when
     we sank into it it was as if some malignant hand was tugging us down
     into those obscene depths, so grim and purposeful was the clutch in
     which it held us. Once only we saw a trace that someone had passed
     that perilous way before us. From amid a tuft of cotton grass which
==>      bore it up out of the slime some dark thing was projecting. Holmes <==
     sank to his waist as he stepped from the path to seize it, and had we
     not been there to drag him out he could never have set his foot upon
     firm land again. He held an old black boot in the air. "Meyers,
     Toronto," was printed on the leather inside.

     by the foul reek of the surrounding swamp. In one of these a staple
     and chain with a quantity of gnawed bones showed where the animal had
     been confined. A skeleton with a tangle of brown hair adhering to it
     lay among the debris.

==>      "A dog!" said Holmes. "By Jove, a curly-haired spaniel. Poor Mortimer <==
     will never see his pet again. Well, I do not know that this place
     contains any secret which we have not already fathomed. He could hide
     his hound, but he could not hush its voice, and hence came those
     cries which even in daylight were not pleasant to hear. On an
     emergency he could keep the hound in the out-house at Merripit, but

     now, that never yet have we helped to hunt down a more dangerous man
     than he who is lying yonder"--he swept his long arm towards the huge
     mottled expanse of green-splotched bog which stretched away until it
     merged into the russet slopes of the moor.

==>      It was the end of November and Holmes and I sat, upon a raw and foggy <==
     night, on either side of a blazing fire in our sitting-room in Baker
     Street. Since the tragic upshot of our visit to Devonshire he had
     been engaged in two affairs of the utmost importance, in the first of
     which he had exposed the atrocious conduct of Colonel Upwood in
     connection with the famous card scandal of the Nonpareil Club, while

     their way to that long voyage which had been recommended for the
     restoration of his shattered nerves. They had called upon us that
     very afternoon, so that it was natural that the subject should come
     up for discussion.

==>      "The whole course of events," said Holmes, "from the point of view of <==
     the man who called himself Stapleton was simple and direct, although
     to us, who had no means in the beginning of knowing the motives of
     his actions and could only learn part of the facts, it all appeared
     exceedingly complex. I have had the advantage of two conversations
     with Mrs. Stapleton, and the case has now been so entirely cleared up

     band nearly an inch across. "To James Mortimer, M.R.C.S., from his
     friends of the C.C.H.," was engraved upon it, with the date "1884."
     It was just such a stick as the old-fashioned family practitioner
     used to carry--dignified, solid, and reassuring.

==>      "Well, Watson, what do you make of it?" <==

     Holmes was sitting with his back to me, and I had given him no sign
     of my occupation.

     "How did you know what I was doing? I believe you have eyes in the

     back of your head."

     "I have, at least, a well-polished, silver-plated coffee-pot in front
==>      of me," said he. "But, tell me, Watson, what do you make of our <==
     visitor's stick? Since we have been so unfortunate as to miss him and
     have no notion of his errand, this accidental souvenir becomes of
     importance. Let me hear you reconstruct the man by an examination of
     it."

     "And then again, there is the 'friends of the C.C.H.' I should guess
     that to be the Something Hunt, the local hunt to whose members he has
     possibly given some surgical assistance, and which has made him a
     small presentation in return."

==>      "Really, Watson, you excel yourself," said Holmes, pushing back his <==
     chair and lighting a cigarette. "I am bound to say that in all the
     accounts which you have been so good as to give of my own small
     achievements you have habitually underrated your own abilities. It
     may be that you are not yourself luminous, but you are a conductor of
     light. Some people without possessing genius have a remarkable power

     deductions."

     "Has anything escaped me?" I asked with some self-importance. "I
     trust that there is nothing of consequence which I have overlooked?"

==>      "I am afraid, my dear Watson, that most of your conclusions were <==
     erroneous. When I said that you stimulated me I meant, to be frank,
     that in noting your fallacies I was occasionally guided towards the
     truth. Not that you are entirely wrong in this instance. The man is
     certainly a country practitioner. And he walks a good deal."

     "To that extent."

     "But that was all."

==>      "No, no, my dear Watson, not all--by no means all. I would suggest, <==
     for example, that a presentation to a doctor is more likely to come
     from a hospital than from a hunt, and that when the initials 'C.C.'
     are placed before that hospital the words 'Charing Cross' very
     naturally suggest themselves."

     could hold such a position, and such a one would not drift into the
     country. What was he, then? If he was in the hospital and yet not on
     the staff he could only have been a house-surgeon or a
     house-physician--little more than a senior student. And he left five
     years ago--the date is on the stick. So your grave, middle-aged
==>      family practitioner vanishes into thin air, my dear Watson, and there <==
     emerges a young fellow under thirty, amiable, unambitious,
     absent-minded, and the possessor of a favourite dog, which I should
     describe roughly as being larger than a terrier and smaller than a
     mastiff."

     mischievous smile, "but a country doctor, as you very astutely
     observed. I think that I am fairly justified in my inferences. As to
     the adjectives, I said, if I remember right, amiable, unambitious,

     prepared for just such an end as did eventually overtake him."

     Holmes stretched out his hand for the manuscript and flattened it
     upon his knee.

==>      "You will observe, Watson, the alternative use of the long s and the <==
     short. It is one of several indications which enabled me to fix the
     date."

     I looked over his shoulder at the yellow paper and the faded script.
     At the head was written: "Baskerville Hall," and below in large,

     "Thank you. Good morning."

     satisfaction which meant that he had a congenial task before him.

     "Unless I can help you."

     "No, my dear fellow, it is at the hour of action that I turn to you
     for aid. But this is splendid, really unique from some points of

     which took me by the throat and set me coughing. Through the haze I
     had a vague vision of Holmes in his dressing-gown coiled up in an
     armchair with his black clay pipe between his lips. Several rolls of
     paper lay around him.

==>      "Caught cold, Watson?" said he. <==

     "No, it's this poisonous atmosphere."

     "I suppose it is pretty thick, now that you mention it."

     "Certainly, but how?"

     He laughed at my bewildered expression.

     pleasure to exercise any small powers which I possess at your
     expense. A gentleman goes forth on a showery and miry day. He returns
     immaculate in the evening with the gloss still on his hat and his
     boots. He has been a fixture therefore all day. He is not a man with
     intimate friends. Where, then, could he have been? Is it not

     "He only repeated what some fool had said at the inquest. Why should
     a man walk on tiptoe down the alley?"

     "What then?"

     running until he burst his heart and fell dead upon his face."

     "Running from what?"

     "There lies our problem. There are indications that the man was

     "But he went out every evening."

     "I think it unlikely that he waited at the moor-gate every evening.
     On the contrary, the evidence is that he avoided the moor. That night
     he waited there. It was the night before he made his departure for

     ask you to hand me my violin, and we will postpone all further
     thought upon this business until we have had the advantage of meeting
     Dr. Mortimer and Sir Henry Baskerville in the morning."

     Our breakfast-table was cleared early, and Holmes waited in his

     "You shall share our knowledge before you leave this room, Sir Henry.
     I promise you that," said Sherlock Holmes. "We will confine ourselves
     for the present with your permission to this very interesting
     document, which must have been put together and posted yesterday
==>      evening. Have you yesterday's Times, Watson?" <==

     "It is here in the corner."

     "Might I trouble you for it--the inside page, please, with the
     leading articles?" He glanced swiftly over it, running his eyes up

     your own industry will be encouraged by a protective tariff, but it
     stands to reason that such legislation must in the long run keep away
     wealth from the country, diminish the value of our imports, and lower
     the general conditions of life in this island.'

     rubbing his hands together with satisfaction. "Don't you think that
     is an admirable sentiment?"

     Dr. Mortimer looked at Holmes with an air of professional interest,
     and Sir Henry Baskerville turned a pair of puzzled dark eyes upon me.

     "I don't know much about the tariff and things of that kind," said

     note is concerned."

     "On the contrary, I think we are particularly hot upon the trail, Sir

     he, "I have hardly had time to think over all that you have told me.
     It's a big thing for a man to have to understand and to decide at one
     sitting. I should like to have a quiet hour by myself to make up my

     We heard the steps of our visitors descend the stair and the bang of
     the front door. In an instant Holmes had changed from the languid
     dreamer to the man of action.

==>      "Your hat and boots, Watson, quick! Not a moment to lose!" He rushed <==
     into his room in his dressing-gown and was back again in a few
     seconds in a frock-coat. We hurried together down the stairs and into
     the street. Dr. Mortimer and Baskerville were still visible about two
     hundred yards ahead of us in the direction of Oxford Street.

     hundred yards ahead of us in the direction of Oxford Street.

     "Shall I run on and stop them?"

     your company if you will tolerate mine. Our friends are wise, for it
     is certainly a very fine morning for a walk."

     He quickened his pace until we had decreased the distance which
     divided us by about half. Then, still keeping a hundred yards behind,

[line number in individual story] matching line = 1498    window = 1493 1503

     the same. An instant afterwards he gave a little cry of satisfaction,
     and, following the direction of his eager eyes, I saw that a hansom
     cab with a man inside which had halted on the other side of the
     street was now proceeding slowly onward again.

==>      "There's our man, Watson! Come along! We'll have a good look at him, <==
     if we can do no more."

     At that instant I was aware of a bushy black beard and a pair of
     piercing eyes turned upon us through the side window of the cab.
     Instantly the trapdoor at the top flew up, something was screamed to

     he dashed in wild pursuit amid the stream of the traffic, but the
     start was too great, and already the cab was out of sight.

     "There now!" said Holmes bitterly as he emerged panting and white
     with vexation from the tide of vehicles. "Was ever such bad luck and

     false one. A clever man upon so delicate an errand has no use for a

     He turned into one of the district messenger offices, where he was
     warmly greeted by the manager.

     "Ah, Wilson, I see you have not forgotten the little case in which I

     that the waste of the day before has been burned or removed. In the

     your finding it. There are ten shillings over in case of emergencies.
     Let me have a report by wire at Baker Street before evening. And now,

     seen, very anxious to watch him, they are equally anxious that he
     should not see them. Now, this is a most suggestive fact."

     more confidently than I."

     The proposition took me completely by surprise, but before I had time
     to answer, Baskerville seized me by the hand and wrung it heartily.

==>      "Well, now, that is real kind of you, Dr. Watson," said he. "You see <==
     how it is with me, and you know just as much about the matter as I
     do. If you will come down to Baskerville Hall and see me through I'll
     never forget it."

     The promise of adventure had always a fascination for me, and I was

     "And you will report very carefully to me," said Holmes. "When a
     crisis comes, as it will do, I will direct how you shall act. I
     suppose that by Saturday all might be ready?"

==>      "Would that suit Dr. Watson?" <==

     "Perfectly."

     "Then on Saturday, unless you hear to the contrary, we shall meet at
     the 10.30 train from Paddington."

     cast round for another scent."

     "We have still the cabman who drove the spy."

     Never have I seen my friend more completely taken aback than by the
     cabman's reply. For an instant he sat in silent amazement. Then he
     burst into a hearty laugh.

==>      "A touch, Watson--an undeniable touch!" said he. "I feel a foil as <==
     quick and supple as my own. He got home upon me very prettily that
     time. So his name was Sherlock Holmes, was it?"

     "Yes, sir, that was the gentleman's name."

     "Snap goes our third thread, and we end where we began," said he.
     "The cunning rascal! He knew our number, knew that Sir Henry
     Baskerville had consulted me, spotted who I was in Regent Street,
     conjectured that I had got the number of the cab and would lay my
     hands on the driver, and so sent back this audacious message. I tell

     steel. I've been checkmated in London. I can only wish you better
     luck in Devonshire. But I'm not easy in my mind about it."

     "About what?"

     "About what?"

     business, and the more I see of it the less I like it. Yes, my dear
     fellow, you may laugh, but I give you my word that I shall be very
     glad to have you back safe and sound in Baker Street once more."

     day, and we started as arranged for Devonshire. Mr. Sherlock Holmes
     drove with me to the station and gave me his last parting injunctions
     and advice.

     "I will not bias your mind by suggesting theories or suspicions,
==>      Watson," said he; "I wish you simply to report facts in the fullest <==
     possible manner to me, and you can leave me to do the theorizing."

     "What sort of facts?" I asked.

     "Anything which may seem to have a bearing however indirect upon the

     vegetation spoke of a richer, if a damper, climate. Young Baskerville
     stared eagerly out of the window, and cried aloud with delight as he
     recognized the familiar features of the Devon scenery.

     "I've been over a good part of the world since I left it, Dr.
==>      Watson," said he; "but I have never seen a place to compare with it." <==

     "I never saw a Devonshire man who did not swear by his county," I
     remarked.

     "It depends upon the breed of men quite as much as on the county,"

     young when you last saw Baskerville Hall, were you not?"

     "I was a boy in my 'teens at the time of my father's death, and had
     never seen the Hall, for he lived in a little cottage on the South
     Coast. Thence I went straight to a friend in America. I tell you it
==>      is all as new to me as it is to Dr. Watson, and I'm as keen as <==
     possible to see the moor."

     "Are you? Then your wish is easily granted, for there is your first
     sight of the moor," said Dr. Mortimer, pointing out of the carriage
     window.

     flaxen-haired and lean-jawed, between thirty and forty years of age,
     dressed in a gray suit and wearing a straw hat. A tin box for
     botanical specimens hung over his shoulder and he carried a green
     butterfly-net in one of his hands.

==>      "You will, I am sure, excuse my presumption, Dr. Watson," said he, as <==
     he came panting up to where I stood. "Here on the moor we are homely
     folk and do not wait for formal introductions. You may possibly have
     heard my name from our mutual friend, Mortimer. I am Stapleton, of
     Merripit House."

     The words took away my breath for an instant, but a glance at the
     placid face and steadfast eyes of my companion showed that no
     surprise was intended.

     "It is useless for us to pretend that we do not know you, Dr.
==>      Watson," said he. "The records of your detective have reached us <==
     here, and you could not celebrate him without being known yourself.
     When Mortimer told me your name he could not deny your identity. If
     you are here, then it follows that Mr. Sherlock Holmes is interesting
     himself in the matter, and I am naturally curious to know what view
     he may take."

     "What did he do?"

     "He grazed his cattle on these slopes, and he learned to dig for tin
     when the bronze sword began to supersede the stone axe. Look at the
     great trench in the opposite hill. That is his mark. Yes, you will
==>      find some very singular points about the moor, Dr. Watson. Oh, excuse <==
     me an instant! It is surely Cyclopides."

     A small fly or moth had fluttered across our path, and in an instant
     Stapleton was rushing with extraordinary energy and speed in pursuit
     of it. To my dismay the creature flew straight for the great mire,

     "Why, who do you think this is?"

     "I imagine that it must be Sir Henry Baskerville."

     "No, no," said I. "Only a humble commoner, but his friend. My name is
==>      Dr. Watson." <==

     A flush of vexation passed over her expressive face. "We have been
     talking at cross purposes," said she.

     "Why, you had not very much time for talk," her brother remarked with

     talking at cross purposes," said she.

     "Why, you had not very much time for talk," her brother remarked with
     the same questioning eyes.

==>      "I talked as if Dr. Watson were a resident instead of being merely a <==
     visitor," said she. "It cannot much matter to him whether it is early
     or late for the orchids. But you will come on, will you not, and see
     Merripit House?"

     A short walk brought us to it, a bleak moorland house, once the farm

     recovered from the blow, and much of my capital was irretrievably
     swallowed up. And yet, if it were not for the loss of the charming
     companionship of the boys, I could rejoice over my own misfortune,
     for, with my strong tastes for botany and zoology, I find an
     unlimited field of work here, and my sister is as devoted to Nature
==>      as I am. All this, Dr. Watson, has been brought upon your head by <==
     your expression as you surveyed the moor out of our window."

     "It certainly did cross my mind that it might be a little dull--less
     for you, perhaps, than for your sister."

     "I am sure that he would be delighted."

     "Then perhaps you would mention that I propose to do so. We may in
     our humble way do something to make things more easy for him until he
     becomes accustomed to his new surroundings. Will you come upstairs,

     the most complete one in the south-west of England. By the time that
     you have looked through them lunch will be almost ready."

     But I was eager to get back to my charge. The melancholy of the moor,
     the death of the unfortunate pony, the weird sound which had been

     who knew it, for before I had reached the road I was astounded to see
     Miss Stapleton sitting upon a rock by the side of the track. Her face
     was beautifully flushed with her exertions, and she held her hand to
     her side.

==>      "I have run all the way in order to cut you off, Dr. Watson," said <==
     she. "I had not even time to put on my hat. I must not stop, or my
     brother may miss me. I wanted to say to you how sorry I am about the
     stupid mistake I made in thinking that you were Sir Henry. Please
     forget the words I said, which have no application whatever to you."

     "But I can't forget them, Miss Stapleton," said I. "I am Sir Henry's
     friend, and his welfare is a very close concern of mine. Tell me why
     it was that you were so eager that Sir Henry should return to
     London."

==>      "A woman's whim, Dr. Watson. When you know me better you will <==
     understand that I cannot always give reasons for what I say or do."

     "No, no. I remember the thrill in your voice. I remember the look in
     your eyes. Please, please, be frank with me, Miss Stapleton, for ever
     since I have been here I have been conscious of shadows all round me.

     promise to convey your warning to Sir Henry."

     An expression of irresolution passed for an instant over her face,
     but her eyes had hardened again when she answered me.

==>      "You make too much of it, Dr. Watson," said she. "My brother and I <==
     were very much shocked by the death of Sir Charles. We knew him very
     intimately, for his favourite walk was over the moor to our house. He
     was deeply impressed with the curse which hung over the family, and
     when this tragedy came I naturally felt that there must be some
     grounds for the fears which he had expressed. I was distressed

     After the conversation which I have quoted about Barrymore, Sir Henry
     put on his hat and prepared to go out. As a matter of course I did
     the same.

==>      "What, are you coming, Watson?" he asked, looking at me in a curious <==
     way.

     "That depends on whether you are going on the moor," said I.

     "Yes, I am."

     ran down the hill therefore and met the baronet at the bottom. His

     is at his wit's ends what to do.

     mean to say that you came after me in spite of all?"

     I explained everything to him: how I had found it impossible to
     remain behind, how I had followed him, and how I had witnessed all
     that had occurred. For an instant his eyes blazed at me, but my

     "I can't say that he ever did."

     "I dare say not. I always thought him sane enough until to-day, but
     you can take it from me that either he or I ought to be in a
     strait-jacket. What's the matter with me, anyhow? You've lived near

     that would prevent me from making a good husband to a woman that I
     loved?"

     "I should say not."

     in my life that I know of. And yet he would not so much as let me
     touch the tips of her fingers."

     "Did he say so?"

==>      "That, and a deal more. I tell you, Watson, I've only known her these <==
     few weeks, but from the first I just felt that she was made for me,
     and she, too--she was happy when she was with me, and that I'll
     swear. There's a light in a woman's eyes that speaks louder than
     words. But he has never let us get together, and it was only to-day
     for the first time that I saw a chance of having a few words with her

     of, and that I hoped that she might honour me by becoming my wife.
     That seemed to make the matter no better, so then I lost my temper
     too, and I answered him rather more hotly than I should perhaps,
     considering that she was standing by. So it ended by his going off
     with her, as you saw, and here am I as badly puzzled a man as any in
==>      this county. Just tell me what it all means, Watson, and I'll owe you <==
     more than ever I can hope to pay."

     I tried one or two explanations, but, indeed, I was completely
     puzzled myself. Our friend's title, his fortune, his age, his
     character, and his appearance are all in his favour, and I know

     "There it is!" I cried.

     "No, no, sir, it is nothing--nothing at all!" the butler broke in; "I
     assure you, sir--"

==>      "Move your light across the window, Watson!" cried the baronet. "See, <==
     the other moves also! Now, you rascal, do you deny that it is a
     signal? Come, speak up! Who is your confederate out yonder, and what
     is this conspiracy that is going on?"

     The man's face became openly defiant.

     "Hardly that."

     "Well, it cannot be far if Barrymore had to carry out the food to it.
     And he is waiting, this villain, beside that candle. By thunder,

     The same thought had crossed my own mind. It was not as if the
     Barrymores had taken us into their confidence. Their secret had been
     forced from them. The man was a danger to the community, an
     unmitigated scoundrel for whom there was neither pity nor excuse. We

     How about that hour of darkness in which the power of evil is
     exalted?"

     As if in answer to his words there rose suddenly out of the vast
     gloom of the moor that strange cry which I had already heard upon the

     then the sad moan in which it died away. Again and again it sounded,
     the whole air throbbing with it, strident, wild, and menacing. The
     baronet caught my sleeve and his face glimmered white through the
     darkness.

==>      "My God, what's that, Watson?" <==

     "I don't know. It's a sound they have on the moor. I heard it once
     before."

     It died away, and an absolute silence closed in upon us. We stood

     before."

     It died away, and an absolute silence closed in upon us. We stood
     straining our ears, but nothing came.

==>      "Watson," said the baronet, "it was the cry of a hound." <==

     My blood ran cold in my veins, for there was a break in his voice
     which told of the sudden horror which had seized him.

     "What do they call this sound?" he asked.

     I hesitated but could not escape the question.

     on the moor. They have given up the chase there, and he can lie quiet
     until the ship is ready for him. You can't tell on him without
     getting my wife and me into trouble. I beg you, sir, to say nothing
     to the police."

     would relieve the tax-payer of a burden."

     "Well, sir, I thought no good could come of it. But now you have been

     tell you all that I know about the matter."

     "Very good, Barrymore; you can go." When the butler had left us Sir

     "How do you know of him then?"

     "Selden told me of him, sir, a week ago or more. He's in hiding, too,
     but he's not a convict as far as I can make out. I don't like it, Dr.
==>      Watson--I tell you straight, sir, that I don't like it." He spoke <==
     with a sudden passion of earnestness.

     "Now, listen to me, Barrymore! I have no interest in this matter but
     that of your master. I have come here with no object except to help
     him. Tell me, frankly, what it is that you don't like."

     last it came to my aid. And the messenger of good fortune was none
     other than Mr. Frankland, who was standing, gray-whiskered and
     red-faced, outside the gate of his garden, which opened on to the
     high road along which I travelled.

==>      "Good-day, Dr. Watson," cried he with unwonted good humour, "you must <==
     really give your horses a rest, and come in to have a glass of wine
     and to congratulate me."

     My feelings towards him were very far from being friendly after what
     I had heard of his treatment of his daughter, but I was anxious to

     door. What do you think of that? We'll teach these magnates that they
     cannot ride roughshod over the rights of the commoners, confound
     them! And I've closed the wood where the Fernworthy folk used to
     picnic. These infernal people seem to think that there are no rights
     of property, and that they can swarm where they like with their
==>      papers and their bottles. Both cases decided, Dr. Watson, and both in <==
     my favour. I haven't had such a day since I had Sir John Morland for
     trespass, because he shot in his own warren."

     "How on earth did you do that?"

     submission pleased him and led him to further confidences.

     "You may be sure, sir, that I have very good grounds before I come to
     an opinion. I have seen the boy again and again with his bundle.
     Every day, and sometimes twice a day, I have been able--but wait a
==>      moment, Dr. Watson. Do my eyes deceive me, or is there at the present <==
     moment something moving upon that hill-side?"

     It was several miles off, but I could distinctly see a small dark dot
     against the dull green and gray.

     The telescope, a formidable instrument mounted upon a tripod, stood
     upon the flat leads of the house. Frankland clapped his eye to it and
     gave a cry of satisfaction.

==>      "Quick, Dr. Watson, quick, before he passes over the hill!" <==

     There he was, sure enough, a small urchin with a little bundle upon
     his shoulder, toiling slowly up the hill. When he reached the crest I
     saw the ragged uncouth figure outlined for an instant against the
     cold blue sky. He looked round him with a furtive and stealthy air,

     "Certainly, there is a boy who seems to have some secret errand."

     "And what the errand is even a county constable could guess. But not
     one word shall they have from me, and I bind you to secrecy also, Dr.

     "Just as you wish."

     preserved peaches. As I set it down again, after having examined it,
     my heart leaped to see that beneath it there lay a sheet of paper
     with writing upon it. I raised it, and this was what I read, roughly
     scrawled in pencil:--

==>      Dr. Watson has gone to Coombe Tracey. <==

     For a minute I stood there with the paper in my hands thinking out
     the meaning of this curt message. It was I, then, and not Sir Henry,
     who was being dogged by this secret man. He had not followed me
     himself, but he had set an agent--the boy, perhaps--upon my track,

     pistol in my pocket, determined not to discover myself until I had an
     opportunity of seeing something of the stranger. There was a long
     pause which showed that he had stopped. Then once more the footsteps
     approached and a shadow fell across the opening of the hut.

==>      "It is a lovely evening, my dear Watson," said a well-known voice. "I <==
     really think that you will be more comfortable outside than in."

     For a moment or two I sat breathless, hardly able to believe my ears.
     Then my senses and my voice came back to me, while a crushing weight
     of responsibility seemed in an instant to be lifted from my soul.

     "My footprint, I presume?"

     desire to deceive me you must change your tobacconist; for when I see

     the criminal?"

     "I did not know who you were, but I was determined to find out."

==>      "Excellent, Watson! And how did you localize me? You saw me, perhaps, <==
     on the night of the convict hunt, when I was so imprudent as to allow
     the moon to rise behind me?"

     "Yes, I saw you then."

     "And when she is undeceived?"

     "Why, then we may find the lady of service. It must be our first duty

     Baskerville Hall."

     The last red streaks had faded away in the west and night had settled
     upon the moor. A few faint stars were gleaming in a violet sky.

     need of secrecy between you and me. What is the meaning of it all?
     What is he after?"

     Holmes's voice sank as he answered:--

     not ask me for particulars. My nets are closing upon him, even as his
     are upon Sir Henry, and with your help he is already almost at my
     mercy. There is but one danger which can threaten us. It is that he
     should strike before we are ready to do so. Another day--two at the
     most--and I have my case complete, but until then guard your charge

     out from somewhere far off on the shadowy plain. Now it burst upon
     our ears, nearer, louder, more urgent than before.

     "Where is it?" Holmes whispered; and I knew from the thrill of his
     voice that he, the man of iron, was shaken to the soul. "Where is it,

     "There, I think." I pointed into the darkness.

     "No, there!"

     Again the agonized cry swept through the silent night, louder and
     much nearer than ever. And a new sound mingled with it, a deep,
     muttered rumble, musical and yet menacing, rising and falling like
     the low, constant murmur of the sea.

==>      "The hound!" cried Holmes. "Come, Watson, come! Great heavens, if we <==
     are too late!"

     He had started running swiftly over the moor, and I had followed at
     his heels. But now from somewhere among the broken ground immediately
     in front of us there came one last despairing yell, and then a dull,

     silence of the windless night.

     I saw Holmes put his hand to his forehead like a man distracted. He
     stamped his feet upon the ground.

==>      "He has beaten us, Watson. We are too late." <==

     "No, no, surely not!"

     "Fool that I was to hold my hand. And you, Watson, see what comes of

     through the darkness.

     "The brute! the brute!" I cried with clenched hands. "Oh Holmes, I
     shall never forgive myself for having left him to his fate."

     rounded and complete, I have thrown away the life of my client. It is
     the greatest blow which has befallen me in my career. But how could I
     know--how could l know--that he would risk his life alone upon the
     moor in the face of all my warnings?"

     A figure was approaching us over the moor, and I saw the dull red
     glow of a cigar. The moon shone upon him, and I could distinguish the

     A figure was approaching us over the moor, and I saw the dull red

     dapper shape and jaunty walk of the naturalist. He stopped when he
     saw us, and then came on again.

     But, dear me, what's this? Somebody hurt? Not--don't tell me that it
     is our friend Sir Henry!" He hurried past me and stooped over the
     dead man. I heard a sharp intake of his breath and the cigar fell
     from his fingers.

     My friend bowed his compliments.

     "Yes, indeed. I have no doubt that my friend's explanation will cover

     "We're at close grips at last," said Holmes as we walked together
     across the moor. "What a nerve the fellow has! How he pulled himself
     together in the face of what must have been a paralyzing shock when
     he found that the wrong man had fallen a victim to his plot. I told
==>      you in London, Watson, and I tell you now again, that we have never <==
     had a foeman more worthy of our steel."

     is always to do something energetic. But supposing, for argument's
     sake, that we had him arrested to-night, what on earth the better off
     should we be for that? We could prove nothing against him. There's

     thought, as far as the Baskerville gates.

     "Are you coming up?"

     "Yes; I see no reason for further concealment. But one last word,

     Selden's death was as Stapleton would have us believe. He will have a
     better nerve for the ordeal which he will have to undergo to-morrow,
     when he is engaged, if I remember your report aright, to dine with
     these people."

     her apron. To all the world he was the man of violence, half animal

     is the man who has not one woman to mourn him.

     "That is in answer to mine of this morning. He is the best of the
==>      professionals, I think, and we may need his assistance. Now, Watson, <==
     I think that we cannot employ our time better than by calling upon
     your acquaintance, Mrs. Laura Lyons."

     His plan of campaign was beginning to be evident. He would use the
     baronet in order to convince the Stapletons that we were really gone,

     Mrs. Laura Lyons was in her office, and Sherlock Holmes opened his
     interview with a frankness and directness which considerably amazed
     her.

     "I am investigating the circumstances which attended the death of the
==>      late Sir Charles Baskerville," said he. "My friend here, Dr. Watson, <==
     has informed me of what you have communicated, and also of what you
     have withheld in connection with that matter."

     "What have I withheld?" she asked defiantly.

     admirable screen."

     "We are to wait here?"

     "Yes, we shall make our little ambush here. Get into this hollow,
==>      Lestrade. You have been inside the house, have you not, Watson? Can <==
     you tell the position of the rooms? What are those latticed windows
     at this end?"

     "I think they are the kitchen windows."

     from within. He was only a minute or so inside, and then I heard the
     key turn once more and he passed me and re-entered the house. I saw
     him rejoin his guest, and I crept quietly back to where my companions
     were waiting to tell them what I had seen.

==>      "You say, Watson, that the lady is not there?" Holmes asked, when I <==
     had finished my report.

     "No."

     "Where can she be, then, since there is no light in any other room

     The moon shone on it, and it looked like a great shimmering
     ice-field, with the heads of the distant tors as rocks borne upon its
     surface. Holmes's face was turned towards it, and he muttered
     impatiently as he watched its sluggish drift.

==>      "It's moving towards us, Watson." <==

     "Is that serious?"

     "Very serious, indeed--the one thing upon earth which could have
     disarranged my plans. He can't be very long, now. It is already ten

     as our friend did, and as we ourselves might have done, when he saw
     such a creature bounding through the darkness of the moor upon his
     track. It was a cunning device, for, apart from the chance of driving
     your victim to his death, what peasant would venture to inquire too
     closely into such a creature should he get sight of it, as many have
==>      done, upon the moor? I said it in London, Watson, and I say it again <==
     now, that never yet have we helped to hunt down a more dangerous man
     than he who is lying yonder"--he swept his long arm towards the huge
     mottled expanse of green-splotched bog which stretched away until it
     merged into the russet slopes of the moor.

     as they certainly would do, he could win his wife back to accept an
     accomplished fact and to keep silent upon what she knew. In this I
     fancy that in any case he made a miscalculation, and that, if we had
     not been there, his doom would none the less have been sealed. A
     woman of Spanish blood does not condone such an injury so lightly.
==>      And now, my dear Watson, without referring to my notes, I cannot give <==
     you a more detailed account of this curious case. I do not know that
     anything essential has been left unexplained."

     "He could not hope to frighten Sir Henry to death as he had done the
     old uncle with his bogie hound."

     without ever coming to England at all; or he might adopt an elaborate
     disguise during the short time that he need be in London; or, again,
     he might furnish an accomplice with the proofs and papers, putting
     him in as heir, and retaining a claim upon some proportion of his
     income. We cannot doubt from what we know of him that he would have
==>      found some way out of the difficulty. And now, my dear Watson, we <==
     have had some weeks of severe work, and for one evening, I think, we
     may turn our thoughts into more pleasant channels. I have a box for
     'Les Huguenots.' Have you heard the De Reszkes? Might I trouble you
     then to be ready in half an hour, and we can stop at Marcini's for a
     little dinner on the way?"

     "And ask at the station office if there is a message for me."

     The boy returned with a telegram, which Holmes handed to me. It ran:

     Wire received. Coming down with unsigned warrant. Arrive five-forty.
==>      Lestrade. <==

     "That is in answer to mine of this morning. He is the best of the
     professionals, I think, and we may need his assistance. Now, Watson,
     I think that we cannot employ our time better than by calling upon
     your acquaintance, Mrs. Laura Lyons."

     enough before we go to bed this night."

     The London express came roaring into the station, and a small, wiry
     bulldog of a man had sprung from a first-class carriage. We all three
     shook hands, and I saw at once from the reverential way in which
==>      Lestrade gazed at my companion that he had learned a good deal since <==
     the days when they had first worked together. I could well remember
     the scorn which the theories of the reasoner used then to excite in
     the practical man.

     "Anything good?" he asked.

     "Anything good?" he asked.

     "The biggest thing for years," said Holmes. "We have two hours before
     we need think of starting. I think we might employ it in getting some
==>      dinner and then, Lestrade, we will take the London fog out of your <==
     throat by giving you a breath of the pure night air of Dartmoor.
     Never been there? Ah, well, I don't suppose you will forget your
     first visit."

     One of Sherlock Holmes's defects--if, indeed, one may call it a

     to the scene of action. We did not drive up to the door but got down
     near the gate of the avenue. The wagonette was paid off and ordered
     to return to Coombe Tracey forthwith, while we started to walk to
     Merripit House.

==>      "Are you armed, Lestrade?" <==

     The little detective smiled.

     "As long as I have my trousers I have a hip-pocket, and as long as I
     have my hip-pocket I have something in it."

     admirable screen."

     "We are to wait here?"

     "Yes, we shall make our little ambush here. Get into this hollow,
==>      Lestrade. You have been inside the house, have you not, Watson? Can <==
     you tell the position of the rooms? What are those latticed windows
     at this end?"

     "I think they are the kitchen windows."

     where we lay, and we glared at it, all three, uncertain what horror
     was about to break from the heart of it. I was at Holmes's elbow, and
     I glanced for an instant at his face. It was pale and exultant, his
     eyes shining brightly in the moonlight. But suddenly they started
     forward in a rigid, fixed stare, and his lips parted in amazement. At
==>      the same instant Lestrade gave a yell of terror and threw himself <==
     face downward upon the ground. I sprang to my feet, my inert hand
     grasping my pistol, my mind paralyzed by the dreadful shape which had
     sprung out upon us from the shadows of the fog. A hound it was, an
     enormous coal-black hound, but not such a hound as mortal eyes have
     ever seen. Fire burst from its open mouth, its eyes glowed with a

     Sir Henry lay insensible where he had fallen. We tore away his
     collar, and Holmes breathed a prayer of gratitude when we saw that
     there was no sign of a wound and that the rescue had been in time.
     Already our friend's eyelids shivered and he made a feeble effort to
==>      move. Lestrade thrust his brandy-flask between the baronet's teeth, <==
     and two frightened eyes were looking up at us.

     "My God!" he whispered. "What was it? What, in heaven's name, was
     it?"

     the passage. There was no light save in the dining-room, but Holmes
     caught up the lamp and left no corner of the house unexplored. No
     sign could we see of the man whom we were chasing. On the upper
     floor, however, one of the bedroom doors was locked.

==>      "There's someone in here," cried Lestrade. "I can hear a movement. <==
     Open this door!"

     A faint moaning and rustling came from within. Holmes struck the door
     just over the lock with the flat of his foot and it flew open. Pistol
     in hand, we all three rushed into the room.

     us. In a minute we had torn off the gag, unswathed the bonds, and
     Mrs. Stapleton sank upon the floor in front of us. As her beautiful
     head fell upon her chest I saw the clear red weal of a whiplash
     across her neck.

==>      "The brute!" cried Holmes. "Here, Lestrade, your brandy-bottle! Put <==
     her in the chair! She has fainted from ill-usage and exhaustion."

     She opened her eyes again.

     "Is he safe?" she asked. "Has he escaped?"

     the guiding wands to-night? We planted them together, he and I, to
     mark the pathway through the mire. Oh, if I could only have plucked
     them out to-day. Then indeed you would have had him at your mercy!"

     It was evident to us that all pursuit was in vain until the fog had
==>      lifted. Meanwhile we left Lestrade in possession of the house while <==
     Holmes and I went back with the baronet to Baskerville Hall. The
     story of the Stapletons could no longer be withheld from him, but he
     took the blow bravely when he learned the truth about the woman whom
     he had loved. But the shock of the night's adventures had shattered
     his nerves, and before morning he lay delirious in a high fever,
