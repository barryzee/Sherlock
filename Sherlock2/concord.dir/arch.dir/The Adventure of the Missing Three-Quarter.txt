     We were fairly accustomed to receive weird telegrams at Baker Street,
     but I have a particular recollection of one which reached us on a
     gloomy February morning some seven or eight years ago and gave Mr.
==>      Sherlock Holmes a puzzled quarter of an hour. It was addressed to <==
     him, and ran thus:

     "Please await me. Terrible misfortune. Right wing three-quarter
     missing; indispensable to-morrow.
     Overton."

     "Please await me. Terrible misfortune. Right wing three-quarter
     missing; indispensable to-morrow.
     Overton."

==>      "Strand post-mark and dispatched ten-thirty-six," said Holmes, <==
     reading it over and over. "Mr. Overton was evidently considerably
     excited when he sent it, and somewhat incoherent in consequence.
     Well, well, he will be here, I dare say, by the time I have looked
     through the times, and then we shall know all about it. Even the most
     insignificant problem would be welcome in these stagnant days."

     gradually weaned him from that drug mania which had threatened once
     to check his remarkable career. Now I knew that under ordinary
     conditions he no longer craved for this artificial stimulus, but I
     was well aware that the fiend was not dead, but sleeping; and I have
     known that the sleep was a light one and the waking near when in
==>      periods of idleness I have seen the drawn look upon Holmes's ascetic <==
     face, and the brooding of his deep-set and inscrutable eyes.
     Therefore I blessed this Mr. Overton, whoever he might be, since he
     had come with his enigmatic message to break that dangerous calm
     which brought more peril to my friend than all the storms of his
     tempestuous life.

     announced the arrival of an enormous young man, sixteen stone of
     solid bone and muscle, who spanned the doorway with his broad
     shoulders and looked from one of us to the other with a comely face
     which was haggard with anxiety.

==>      "Mr. Sherlock Holmes?" <==

     My companion bowed.

     "I've been down to Scotland Yard, Mr. Holmes. I saw Inspector Stanley

     My companion bowed.

     Hopkins. He advised me to come to you. He said the case, so far as he
     could see, was more in your line than in that of the regular police."

     "Pray sit down and tell me what is the matter."

     Godfrey Staunton--you've heard of him, of course? He's simply the
     hinge that the whole team turns on. I'd rather spare two from the
     pack and have Godfrey for my three-quarter line. Whether it's

     to the scrum instead of keeping out on the touch-line. He's a fine
     place-kick, it's true, but, then, he has no judgment, and he can't
     sprint for nuts. Why, Morton or Johnson, the Oxford fliers, could
     romp round him. Stevenson is fast enough, but he couldn't drop from

     unless you can help me to find Godfrey Staunton."

     My friend had listened with amused surprise to this long speech,
     which was poured forth with extraordinary vigour and earnestness,
     every point being driven home by the slapping of a brawny hand upon

     My friend had listened with amused surprise to this long speech,
     which was poured forth with extraordinary vigour and earnestness,
     every point being driven home by the slapping of a brawny hand upon
==>      the speaker's knee. When our visitor was silent Holmes stretched out <==
     his hand and took down letter "S" of his commonplace book. For once
     he dug in vain into that mine of varied information.

     "There is Arthur H. Staunton, the rising young forger," said he, "and
     there was Henry Staunton, whom I helped to hang, but Godfrey Staunton

     there was Henry Staunton, whom I helped to hang, but Godfrey Staunton
     is a new name to me."

     It was our visitor's turn to look surprised.

==>      "Why, Mr. Holmes, I thought you knew things," said he. "I suppose, <==
     then, if you have never heard of Godfrey Staunton you don't know
     Cyril Overton either?"

     Holmes shook his head good-humouredly.

     "Great Scot!" cried the athlete. "Why, I was first reserve for
     England against Wales, and I've skippered the 'Varsity all this year.
     But that's nothing! I didn't think there was a soul in England who

     Holmes laughed at the young giant's naive astonishment.

     "You live in a different world to me, Mr. Overton, a sweeter and
     healthier one. My ramifications stretch out into many sections of
     society, but never, I am happy to say, into amateur sport, which is
     the best and soundest thing in England. However, your unexpected

     Young Overton's face assumed the bothered look of the man who is more
     accustomed to using his muscles than his wits; but by degrees, with
     many repetitions and obscurities which I may omit from his narrative,
     he laid his strange story before us.

==>      "It's this way, Mr. Holmes. As I have said, I am the skipper of the <==
     Rugger team of Cambridge 'Varsity, and Godfrey Staunton is my best
     man. To-morrow we play Oxford. Yesterday we all came up and we
     settled at Bentley's private hotel. At ten o'clock I went round and
     saw that all the fellows had gone to roost, for I believe in strict
     training and plenty of sleep to keep a team fit. I had a word or two

     sportsman, was Godfrey, down to his marrow, and he wouldn't have
     stopped his training and let in his skipper if it were not for some
     cause that was too strong for him. No; I feel as if he were gone for
     good and we should never see him again."

==>      Sherlock Holmes listened with the deepest attention to this singular <==
     narrative.

     "What did you do?" he asked.

     "I wired to Cambridge to learn if anything had been heard of him

     Cyril Overton pressed his hands to his head. "I can make nothing of
     it," said he.

     "Well, well, I have a clear day, and I shall be happy to look into
==>      the matter," said Holmes. "I should strongly recommend you to make <==
     your preparations for your match without reference to this young
     gentleman. It must, as you say, have been an overpowering necessity
     which tore him away in such a fashion, and the same necessity is
     likely to hold him away. Let us step round together to this hotel,
     and see if the porter can throw any fresh light upon the matter."

[line number in individual story] matching line = 202    window = 197 207

     gentleman. It must, as you say, have been an overpowering necessity
     which tore him away in such a fashion, and the same necessity is
     likely to hold him away. Let us step round together to this hotel,
     and see if the porter can throw any fresh light upon the matter."

==>      Sherlock Holmes was a past-master in the art of putting a humble <==
     witness at his ease, and very soon, in the privacy of Godfrey
     Staunton's abandoned room, he had extracted all that the porter had
     to tell. The visitor of the night before was not a gentleman, neither
     was he a working man. He was simply what the porter described as a
     "medium-looking chap"; a man of fifty, beard grizzled, pale face,

[line number in individual story] matching line = 216    window = 211 221

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 41397    window = 41392 41402


     shaken hands with the man in the hall. They had exchanged a few
     sentences, of which the porter had only distinguished the one word
     "time." Then they had hurried off in the manner described. It was
     just half-past ten by the hall clock.

==>      "Let me see," said Holmes, seating himself on Staunton's bed. "You <==
     are the day porter, are you not?"

     "Yes, sir; I go off duty at eleven."

     "The night porter saw nothing, I suppose?"

     "Was the telegraphic form one of these on the table?"

     "Yes, sir; it was the top one."

==>      Holmes rose. Taking the forms he carried them over to the window and <==
     carefully examined that which was uppermost.

     "It is a pity he did not write in pencil," said he, throwing them
     down again with a shrug of disappointment. "As you have no doubt
     frequently observed, Watson, the impression usually goes through--a

     [ Picture: Several unreadable scrawls on paper ]

     Cyril Overton was much excited. "Hold it to the glass!" he cried.

==>      "That is unnecessary," said Holmes. "The paper is thin, and the <==
     reverse will give the message. Here it is." He turned it over and we
     read:

     [ Picture: Stand by us for Godâ€™s sake! ]

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 41498    window = 41493 41503


     in these matters! However, I have no doubt that with a little
     delicacy and finesse the end may be attained. Meanwhile, I should
     like in your presence, Mr. Overton, to go through these papers which
     have been left upon the table."

==>      There were a number of letters, bills, and note-books, which Holmes <==
     turned over and examined with quick, nervous fingers and darting,
     penetrating eyes. "Nothing here," he said, at last. "By the way, I
     suppose your friend was a healthy young fellow--nothing amiss with
     him?"

     that I have never wasted money, and I do not propose to begin to do
     so now. As to those papers with which you are making so free, I may
     tell you that in case there should be anything of any value among
     them you will be held strictly to account for what you do with them."

==>      "Very good, sir," said Sherlock Holmes. "May I ask in the meanwhile <==
     whether you have yourself any theory to account for this young man's
     disappearance?"

     "No, sir, I have not. He is big enough and old enough to look after
     himself, and if he is so foolish as to lose himself I entirely refuse

     "No, sir, I have not. He is big enough and old enough to look after
     himself, and if he is so foolish as to lose himself I entirely refuse
     to accept the responsibility of hunting for him."

==>      "I quite understand your position," said Holmes, with a mischievous <==
     twinkle in his eyes. "Perhaps you don't quite understand mine.
     Godfrey Staunton appears to have been a poor man. If he has been
     kidnapped it could not have been for anything which he himself
     possesses. The fame of your wealth has gone abroad, Lord Mount-James,
     and it is entirely possible that a gang of thieves have secured your

     fiver, or even a tenner, goes, you can always look to me."

     Even in his chastened frame of mind the noble miser could give us no
     information which could help us, for he knew little of the private
     life of his nephew. Our only clue lay in the truncated telegram, and
==>      with a copy of this in his hand Holmes set forth to find a second <==
     link for his chain. We had shaken off Lord Mount-James, and Overton
     had gone to consult with the other members of his team over the
     misfortune which had befallen them.

     There was a telegraph-office at a short distance from the hotel. We

     misfortune which had befallen them.

     There was a telegraph-office at a short distance from the hotel. We
     halted outside it.

==>      "It's worth trying, Watson," said Holmes. "Of course, with a warrant <==
     we could demand to see the counterfoils, but we have not reached that
     stage yet. I don't suppose they remember faces in so busy a place.
     Let us venture it."

     "I am sorry to trouble you," said he, in his blandest manner, to the

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 41621    window = 41616 41626



     "A little after six."

     "Whom was it to?"

==>      Holmes put his finger to his lips and glanced at me. "The last words <==
     in it were 'for God's sake,'" he whispered, confidentially; "I am
     very anxious at getting no answer."

     The young woman separated one of the forms.


[line number in individual story] matching line = 450    window = 445 455

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 41631    window = 41626 41636



     "This is it. There is no name," said she, smoothing it out upon the
     counter.

     "Then that, of course, accounts for my getting no answer," said
==>      Holmes. "Dear me, how very stupid of me, to be sure! Good morning, <==
     miss, and many thanks for having relieved my mind." He chuckled and
     rubbed his hands when we found ourselves in the street once more.

     "Well?" I asked.

     telegram that we are now upon our way to Cambridge. The path of our
     investigation is at present obscure, but I shall be very much
     surprised if before evening we have not cleared it up or made a
     considerable advance along it."

==>      It was already dark when we reached the old University city. Holmes <==
     took a cab at the station, and ordered the man to drive to the house
     of Dr. Leslie Armstrong. A few minutes later we had stopped at a
     large mansion in the busiest thoroughfare. We were shown in, and
     after a long wait were at last admitted into the consulting-room,
     where we found the doctor seated behind his table.

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 41706    window = 41701 41711


     a man with an alert mind, grim, ascetic, self-contained,
     formidable--so I read Dr. Leslie Armstrong. He held my friend's card
     in his hand, and he looked up with no very pleased expression upon
     his dour features.

==>      "I have heard your name, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, and I am aware of your <==
     profession, one of which I by no means approve."

     "In that, doctor, you will find yourself in agreement with every
     criminal in the country," said my friend, quietly.

     "Did you ever know him ill?"

     "Never."

==>      Holmes popped a sheet of paper before the doctor's eyes. "Then <==
     perhaps you will explain this receipted bill for thirteen guineas,
     paid by Mr. Godfrey Staunton last month to Dr. Leslie Armstrong of
     Cambridge. I picked it out from among the papers upon his desk."

     The doctor flushed with anger.

     The doctor flushed with anger.

     "I do not feel that there is any reason why I should render an

     Holmes replaced the bill in his note-book. "If you prefer a public
     explanation it must come sooner or later," said he. "I have already
     told you that I can hush up that which others will be bound to
     publish, and you would really be wiser to take me into your complete

     "Did you hear from Mr. Staunton in London?"

     "Certainly not."

==>      "Dear me, dear me; the post-office again!" Holmes sighed, wearily. "A <==
     most urgent telegram was dispatched to you from London by Godfrey
     Staunton at six-fifteen yesterday evening--a telegram which is
     undoubtedly associated with his disappearance--and yet you have not
     had it. It is most culpable. I shall certainly go down to the office
     here and register a complaint."

     "I'll trouble you to walk out of my house, sir," said he. "You can
     tell your employer, Lord Mount-James, that I do not wish to have
     anything to do either with him or with his agents. No, sir, not
     another word!" He rang the bell furiously. "John, show these
     gentlemen out!" A pompous butler ushered us severely to the door, and
==>      we found ourselves in the street. Holmes burst out laughing. <==

     "Dr. Leslie Armstrong is certainly a man of energy and character,"
     said he. "I have not seen a man who, if he turned his talents that
     way, was more calculated to fill the gap left by the illustrious
     Moriarty. And now, my poor Watson, here we are, stranded and

     is singularly adapted to our needs. If you would engage a front room
     and purchase the necessaries for the night, I may have time to make a
     few inquiries."

     These few inquiries proved, however, to be a more lengthy proceeding
==>      than Holmes had imagined, for he did not return to the inn until <==
     nearly nine o'clock. He was pale and dejected, stained with dust, and
     exhausted with hunger and fatigue. A cold supper was ready upon the
     table, and when his needs were satisfied and his pipe alight he was
     ready to take that half comic and wholly philosophic view which was
     natural to him when his affairs were going awry. The sound of

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 41829    window = 41824 41834


     natural to him when his affairs were going awry. The sound of
     carriage wheels caused him to rise and glance out of the window. A
     brougham and pair of greys under the glare of a gas-lamp stood before
     the doctor's door.

==>      "It's been out three hours," said Holmes; "started at half-past six, <==
     and here it is back again. That gives a radius of ten or twelve
     miles, and he does it once, or sometimes twice, a day."

     "No unusual thing for a doctor in practice."

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 41899    window = 41894 41904


     present it must be admitted that the odd trick is in his possession,
     and, as you are aware, Watson, it is not my habit to leave the game
     in that condition."

     And yet the next day brought us no nearer to the solution of the
==>      mystery. A note was handed in after breakfast, which Holmes passed <==
     across to me with a smile.

     Sir [it ran]:
     I can assure you that you are wasting your time in dogging my
     movements. I have, as you discovered last night, a window at the back

[line number in individual story] matching line = 734    window = 729 739

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 41915    window = 41910 41920


     report to your employer that you are unable to trace him. Your time
     in Cambridge will certainly be wasted.
     Yours faithfully,
     Leslie Armstrong.

==>      "An outspoken, honest antagonist is the doctor," said Holmes. "Well, <==
     well, he excites my curiosity, and I must really know more before I
     leave him."

     "His carriage is at his door now," said I. "There he is stepping into
     it. I saw him glance up at our window as he did so. Suppose I try my

     combination in the three-quarter line and their weakness both in
     attack and defence more than neutralized the efforts of a heavy and
     hard-working pack.'"

     "Then our friend Overton's forebodings have been justified," said
==>      Holmes. "Personally I am in agreement with Dr. Armstrong, and <==
     football does not come within my horizon. Early to bed to-night,
     Watson, for I foresee that to-morrow may be an eventful day."

     I was horrified by my first glimpse of Holmes next morning, for he
     sat by the fire holding his tiny hypodermic syringe. I associated

     Watson, for I foresee that to-morrow may be an eventful day."

==>      I was horrified by my first glimpse of Holmes next morning, for he <==
     sat by the fire holding his tiny hypodermic syringe. I associated
     that instrument with the single weakness of his nature, and I feared
     the worst when I saw it glittering in his hand. He laughed at my
     expression of dismay, and laid it upon the table.

     "Never mind. Let him go. He will be clever if he can drive where I
     cannot follow him. When you have finished come downstairs with me,
     and I will introduce you to a detective who is a very eminent
     specialist in the work that lies before us."

==>      When we descended I followed Holmes into the stable yard, where he <==
     opened the door of a loose-box and led out a squat, lop-eared,
     white-and-tan dog, something between a beagle and a foxhound.

     "Let me introduce you to Pompey," said he. "Pompey is the pride of
     the local draghounds, no very great flier, as his build will show,

     led him across to the doctor's door. The dog sniffed round for an
     instant, and then with a shrill whine of excitement started off down
     the street, tugging at his leash in his efforts to go faster. In half
     an hour, we were clear of the town and hastening down a country road.

==>      "What have you done, Holmes?" I asked. <==

     "A threadbare and venerable device, but useful upon occasion. I
     walked into the doctor's yard this morning and shot my syringe full
     of aniseed over the hind wheel. A draghound will follow aniseed from
     here to John o' Groat's, and our friend Armstrong would have to drive

     the trail turned hard to the right in the direction of the town,
     which we had just quitted. The road took a sweep to the south of the
     town and continued in the opposite direction to that in which we
     started.

==>      "This dÃ©tour has been entirely for our benefit, then?" said Holmes. <==
     "No wonder that my inquiries among those villages led to nothing. The
     doctor has certainly played the game for all it is worth, and one
     would like to know the reason for such elaborate deception. This
     should be the village of Trumpington to the right of us. And, by
     Jove! here is the brougham coming round the corner. Quick, Watson,

     There could be no doubt that we had reached the end of our journey.
     Pompey ran about and whined eagerly outside the gate where the marks
     of the brougham's wheels were still to be seen. A footpath led across
==>      to the lonely cottage. Holmes tied the dog to the hedge, and we <==
     hastened onwards. My friend knocked at the little rustic door, and
     knocked again without response. And yet the cottage was not deserted,
     for a low sound came to our ears--a kind of drone of misery and
     despair, which was indescribably melancholy. Holmes paused
     irresolute, and then he glanced back at the road which we had just

     "By Jove, the doctor is coming back!" cried Holmes. "That settles it.

     He opened the door and we stepped into the hall. The droning sound
     swelled louder upon our ears until it became one long, deep wail of
     distress. It came from upstairs. Holmes darted up and I followed him.

     He pushed open a half-closed door and we both stood appalled at the
     sight before us.

     A woman, young and beautiful, was lying dead upon the bed. Her calm,
     pale face, with dim, wide-opened blue eyes, looked upward from amid a

     A woman, young and beautiful, was lying dead upon the bed. Her calm,
     pale face, with dim, wide-opened blue eyes, looked upward from amid a
     great tangle of golden hair. At the foot of the bed, half sitting,
     half kneeling, his face buried in the clothes, was a young man, whose
     frame was racked by his sobs. So absorbed was he by his bitter grief
==>      that he never looked up until Holmes's hand was on his shoulder. <==

     "Are you Mr. Godfrey Staunton?"

     "Yes, yes; I am--but you are too late. She is dead."

     "Are you Mr. Godfrey Staunton?"

     "Yes, yes; I am--but you are too late. She is dead."

     The man was so dazed that he could not be made to understand that we
==>      were anything but doctors who had been sent to his assistance. Holmes <==
     was endeavouring to utter a few words of consolation, and to explain
     the alarm which had been caused to his friends by his sudden
     disappearance, when there was a step upon the stairs, and there was
     the heavy, stern, questioning face of Dr. Armstrong at the door.

     anxious to hush up private scandals than to give them publicity. If,
     as I imagine, there is no breach of the law in this matter, you can
     absolutely depend upon my discretion and my co-operation in keeping
     the facts out of the papers."

==>      Dr. Armstrong took a quick step forward and wrung Holmes by the hand. <==

     "You are a good fellow," said he. "I had misjudged you. I thank
     Heaven that my compunction at leaving poor Staunton all alone in this
     plight caused me to turn my carriage back, and so to make your
     acquaintance. Knowing as much as you do, the situation is very easily

     danger was, for I knew that he could do no good here, but I sent the
     truth to the girl's father, and he very injudiciously communicated it
     to Godfrey. The result was that he came straight away in a state
     bordering on frenzy, and has remained in the same state, kneeling at
     the end of her bed, until this morning death put an end to her
==>      sufferings. That is all, Mr. Holmes, and I am sure that I can rely <==
     upon your discretion and that of your friend."

     Holmes grasped the doctor's hand.

     "Come, Watson," said he, and we passed from that house of grief into

     "Come, Watson," said he, and we passed from that house of grief into
     the pale sunlight of the winter day.

     Holmes rose. Taking the forms he carried them over to the window and
     carefully examined that which was uppermost.

     "It is a pity he did not write in pencil," said he, throwing them
     down again with a shrug of disappointment. "As you have no doubt
==>      frequently observed, Watson, the impression usually goes through--a <==
     fact which has dissolved many a happy marriage. However, I can find
     no trace here. I rejoice, however, to perceive that he wrote with a
     broad-pointed quill pen, and I can hardly doubt that we will find
     some impression upon this blotting-pad. Ah, yes, surely this is the

     already narrowed down to that."

     "We have only to find to whom that telegram is addressed," I
     suggested.

==>      "Exactly, my dear Watson. Your reflection, though profound, had <==
     already crossed my mind. But I dare say it may have come to your
     notice that if you walk into a post-office and demand to see the
     counterfoil of another man's message there may be some disinclination
     on the part of the officials to oblige you. There is so much red tape
     in these matters! However, I have no doubt that with a little

     misfortune which had befallen them.

     There was a telegraph-office at a short distance from the hotel. We
     halted outside it.

==>      "It's worth trying, Watson," said Holmes. "Of course, with a warrant <==
     we could demand to see the counterfoils, but we have not reached that
     stage yet. I don't suppose they remember faces in so busy a place.
     Let us venture it."

     "I am sorry to trouble you," said he, in his blandest manner, to the

     miss, and many thanks for having relieved my mind." He chuckled and
     rubbed his hands when we found ourselves in the street once more.

     "Well?" I asked.

==>      "We progress, my dear Watson, we progress. I had seven different <==
     schemes for getting a glimpse of that telegram, but I could hardly
     hope to succeed the very first time."

     "And what have you gained?"

     suspicion yet as to the cause of the disappearance? I don't think
     that among all our cases I have known one where the motives are more
     obscure. Surely you don't really imagine that he may be kidnapped in
     order to give information against his wealthy uncle?"

==>      "I confess, my dear Watson, that that does not appeal to me as a very <==
     probable explanation. It struck me, however, as being the one which
     was most likely to interest that exceedingly unpleasant old person."

     "It certainly did that. But what are your alternatives?"

     present be, and it is not impossible that a plot to hold him for
     ransom might be concocted."

     "These theories take no account of the telegram."

     with which we have to deal, and we must not permit our attention to
     wander away from it. It is to gain light upon the purpose of this
     telegram that we are now upon our way to Cambridge. The path of our
     investigation is at present obscure, but I shall be very much
     surprised if before evening we have not cleared it up or made a

     we found ourselves in the street. Holmes burst out laughing.

     "Dr. Leslie Armstrong is certainly a man of energy and character,"
     said he. "I have not seen a man who, if he turned his talents that
     way, was more calculated to fill the gap left by the illustrious
==>      Moriarty. And now, my poor Watson, here we are, stranded and <==
     friendless in this inhospitable town, which we cannot leave without
     abandoning our case. This little inn just opposite Armstrong's house
     is singularly adapted to our needs. If you would engage a front room
     and purchase the necessaries for the night, I may have time to make a
     few inquiries."

     long journeys, which must be exceedingly irksome to him, and who is
     it that he visits?"

     "His coachman--"

==>      "My dear Watson, can you doubt that it was to him that I first <==
     applied? I do not know whether it came from his own innate depravity
     or from the promptings of his master, but he was rude enough to set a
     dog at me. Neither dog nor man liked the look of my stick, however,
     and the matter fell through. Relations were strained after that, and
     further inquiries out of the question. All that I have learned I got

     me of the doctor's habits and of his daily journey. At that instant,
     to give point to his words, the carriage came round to the door."

     "Could you not follow it?"

==>      "Excellent, Watson! You are scintillating this evening. The idea did <==
     cross my mind. There is, as you may have observed, a bicycle shop
     next to our inn. Into this I rushed, engaged a bicycle, and was able
     to get started before the carriage was quite out of sight. I rapidly
     overtook it, and then, keeping at a discreet distance of a hundred
     yards or so, I followed its lights until we were clear of the town.

[line number in individual story] matching line = 714    window = 709 719

     Armstrong, whose name the obliging young lady at the office allowed
     me to read upon the counterfoil of Staunton's urgent message. He
     knows where the young man is--to that I'll swear--and if he knows,
     then it must be our own fault if we cannot manage to know also. At
     present it must be admitted that the odd trick is in his possession,
==>      and, as you are aware, Watson, it is not my habit to leave the game <==
     in that condition."

     And yet the next day brought us no nearer to the solution of the
     mystery. A note was handed in after breakfast, which Holmes passed
     across to me with a smile.

     "His carriage is at his door now," said I. "There he is stepping into
     it. I saw him glance up at our window as he did so. Suppose I try my
     luck upon the bicycle?"

==>      "No, no, my dear Watson! With all respect for your natural acumen I <==
     do not think that you are quite a match for the worthy doctor. I
     think that possibly I can attain our end by some independent
     explorations of my own. I am afraid that I must leave you to your own
     devices, as the appearance of two inquiring strangers upon a sleepy
     countryside might excite more gossip than I care for. No doubt you

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 41935    window = 41930 41940


     to bring back a more favourable report to you before evening."

     Once more, however, my friend was destined to be disappointed. He
     came back at night weary and unsuccessful.

==>      "I have had a blank day, Watson. Having got the doctor's general <==
     direction, I spent the day in visiting all the villages upon that
     side of Cambridge, and comparing notes with publicans and other local
     news agencies. I have covered some ground: Chesterton, Histon,
     Waterbeach, and Oakington have each been explored and have each
     proved disappointing. The daily appearance of a brougham and pair

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 41968    window = 41963 41973


     hard-working pack.'"

     "Then our friend Overton's forebodings have been justified," said
     Holmes. "Personally I am in agreement with Dr. Armstrong, and
     football does not come within my horizon. Early to bed to-night,
==>      Watson, for I foresee that to-morrow may be an eventful day." <==

     I was horrified by my first glimpse of Holmes next morning, for he
     sat by the fire holding his tiny hypodermic syringe. I associated
     that instrument with the single weakness of his nature, and I feared
     the worst when I saw it glittering in his hand. He laughed at my

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 41980    window = 41975 41985



     "No, no, my dear fellow, there is no cause for alarm. It is not upon
     this occasion the instrument of evil, but it will rather prove to be
     the key which will unlock our mystery. On this syringe I base all my
     hopes. I have just returned from a small scouting expedition and
==>      everything is favourable. Eat a good breakfast, Watson, for I propose <==
     to get upon Dr. Armstrong's trail to-day, and once on it I will not
     stop for rest or food until I run him to his burrow."

     "In that case," said I, "we had best carry our breakfast with us, for
     he is making an early start. His carriage is at the door."
