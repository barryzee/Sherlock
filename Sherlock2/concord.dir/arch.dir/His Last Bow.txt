     It was nine o'clock at night upon the second of August--the most
     terrible August in the history of the world. One might have thought
     already that God's curse hung heavy over a degenerate world, for
     there was an awesome hush and a feeling of vague expectancy in the

     Culture. Only for one instant did the master spy glare at this
     strangely irrelevant inscription. The next he was gripped at the back
     of his neck by a grasp of iron, and a chloroformed sponge was held in
     front of his writhing face.

==>      "Another glass, Watson!" said Mr. Sherlock Holmes as he extended the <==
     bottle of Imperial Tokay.

     The thickset chauffeur, who had seated himself by the table, pushed
     forward his glass with some eagerness.

     The thickset chauffeur, who had seated himself by the table, pushed
     forward his glass with some eagerness.

     "A remarkable wine, Watson. Our friend upon the sofa has assured me
     that it is from Franz Josef's special cellar at the Schoenbrunn

     We waited some time for your signal to-night."

     speech surely shows you, Mr. Altamont of Chicago had no existence in

     Von Bork sat up in amazement.

     "There is only one man," he cried.

     require some checking and you have little time to check it. Your
     admiral may find the new guns rather larger than he expects, and the

     Von Bork clutched at his own throat in despair.

     ripened. Well, sir, I hope that you are none the worse!"

     The last remark was addressed to Von Bork himself, who after much
     gasping and blinking had lain quietly listening to Holmes's
     statement. He broke out now into a furious stream of German

     other people, have at last been outwitted yourself. After all, you
     have done your best for your country, and I have done my best for
     mine, and what could be more natural? Besides," he added, not
     unkindly, as he laid his hand upon the shoulder of the prostrate man,
     "it is better than to fall before some ignoble foe. These papers are
==>      now ready, Watson. If you will help me with our prisoner, I think <==
     that we may get started for London at once."

     creature, but at present his temper is a little inflamed, and it
     would be as well not to try him too far. No, Mr. Von Bork, you will
     go with us in a quiet, sensible fashion to Scotland Yard, whence you
     can send for your friend, Baron Von Herling, and see if even now you
     may not fill that place which he has reserved for you in the
==>      ambassadorial suite. As to you, Watson, you are joining us with your <==
     old service, as I understand, so London won't be out of your way.
     Stand with me here upon the terrace, for it may be the last quiet
     talk that we shall ever have."

     The two friends chatted in intimate converse for a few minutes,

     recalling once again the days of the past, while their prisoner
     vainly wriggled to undo the bonds that held him. As they turned to
     the car Holmes pointed back to the moonlit sea and shook a thoughtful
     head.
