     Of all the problems which have been submitted to my friend, Mr.
==>      Sherlock Holmes, for solution during the years of our intimacy, there <==
     were only two which I was the means of introducing to his
     notice--that of Mr. Hatherley's thumb, and that of Colonel
     Warburton's madness. Of these the latter may have afforded a finer
     field for an acute and original observer, but the other was so
     strange in its inception and so dramatic in its details that it may

     At the time the circumstances made a deep impression upon me, and the
     lapse of two years has hardly served to weaken the effect.

     It was in the summer of '89, not long after my marriage, that the
     events occurred which I am now about to summarise. I had returned to
==>      civil practice and had finally abandoned Holmes in his Baker Street <==
     rooms, although I continually visited him and occasionally even
     persuaded him to forgo his Bohemian habits so far as to come and
     visit us. My practice had steadily increased, and as I happened to
     live at no very great distance from Paddington Station, I got a few
     patients from among the officials. One of these, whom I had cured of

[line number in individual story] matching line = 150    window = 145 155

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 17373    window = 17368 17378


     clues which I can give them are so vague that it is a question
     whether justice will be done."

     "Ha!" cried I, "if it is anything in the nature of a problem which
     you desire to see solved, I should strongly recommend you to come to
==>      my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, before you go to the official <==
     police."

     "Oh, I have heard of that fellow," answered my visitor, "and I should
     be very glad if he would take the matter up, though of course I must
     use the official police as well. Would you give me an introduction to

[line number in individual story] matching line = 172    window = 167 177

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 17395    window = 17390 17400


     "Then my servant will call a cab, and I shall be with you in an
     instant." I rushed upstairs, explained the matter shortly to my wife,
     and in five minutes was inside a hansom, driving with my new
     acquaintance to Baker Street.

==>      Sherlock Holmes was, as I expected, lounging about his sitting-room <==
     in his dressing-gown, reading the agony column of The Times and
     smoking his before-breakfast pipe, which was composed of all the
     plugs and dottles left from his smokes of the day before, all
     carefully dried and collected on the corner of the mantelpiece. He
     received us in his quietly genial fashion, ordered fresh rashers and

[line number in individual story] matching line = 192    window = 187 197

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 17415    window = 17410 17420


     "Thank you," said my patient. "but I have felt another man since the
     doctor bandaged me, and I think that your breakfast has completed the
     cure. I shall take up as little of your valuable time as possible, so
     I shall start at once upon my peculiar experiences."

==>      Holmes sat in his big armchair with the weary, heavy-lidded <==
     expression which veiled his keen and eager nature, while I sat
     opposite to him, and we listened in silence to the strange story
     which our visitor detailed to us.

     "You must know," said he, "that I am an orphan and a bachelor,

[line number in individual story] matching line = 413    window = 408 418

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 17636    window = 17631 17641


     waiting in the shadow upon the other side. Without a word he grasped
     my arm and hurried me into a carriage, the door of which was standing
     open. He drew up the windows on either side, tapped on the wood-work,
     and away we went as fast as the horse could go."

==>      "One horse?" interjected Holmes. <==

     "Yes, only one."

     "Did you observe the colour?"


[line number in individual story] matching line = 740    window = 735 745

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 17963    window = 17958 17968


     wound dressed, and then the doctor was kind enough to bring me along
     here. I put the case into your hands and shall do exactly what you
     advise."

     We both sat in silence for some little time after listening to this
==>      extraordinary narrative. Then Sherlock Holmes pulled down from the <==
     shelf one of the ponderous commonplace books in which he placed his
     cuttings.

     "Here is an advertisement which will interest you," said he. "It
     appeared in all the papers about a year ago. Listen to this:

[line number in individual story] matching line = 766    window = 761 771

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 17989    window = 17984 17994


     now is precious, so if you feel equal to it we shall go down to
     Scotland Yard at once as a preliminary to starting for Eyford."

     Some three hours or so afterwards we were all in the train together,
     bound from Reading to the little Berkshire village. There were
==>      Sherlock Holmes, the hydraulic engineer, Inspector Bradstreet, of <==
     Scotland Yard, a plain-clothes man, and myself. Bradstreet had spread
     an ordnance map of the county out upon the seat and was busy with his
     compasses drawing a circle with Eyford for its centre.

     "There you are," said he. "That circle is drawn at a radius of ten

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 18017    window = 18012 18022



     "Oh, we shall soon clear up all that," said Bradstreet. "Well, I have
     drawn my circle, and I only wish I knew at what point upon it the
     folk that we are in search of are to be found."

==>      "I think I could lay my finger on it," said Holmes quietly. <==

     "Really, now!" cried the inspector, "you have formed your opinion!
     Come, now, we shall see who agrees with you. I say it is south, for
     the country is more deserted there."

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 18052    window = 18047 18057



     "Indeed, it is a likely ruse enough," observed Bradstreet
     thoughtfully. "Of course there can be no doubt as to the nature of
     this gang."

==>      "None at all," said Holmes. "They are coiners on a large scale, and <==
     have used the machine to form the amalgam which has taken the place
     of silver."

     "We have known for some time that a clever gang was at work," said
     the inspector. "They have been turning out half-crowns by the

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 18102    window = 18097 18107



     "That's it!" cried Hatherley, in intense excitement. "There is the
     gravel-drive, and there are the rose-bushes where I lay. That second
     window is the one that I jumped from."

==>      "Well, at least," said Holmes, "you have had your revenge upon them. <==
     There can be no question that it was your oil-lamp which, when it was
     crushed in the press, set fire to the wooden walls, though no doubt
     they were too excited in the chase after you to observe it at the
     time. Now keep your eyes open in this crowd for your friends of last
     night, though I very much fear that they are a good hundred miles off

[line number in individual story] matching line = 887    window = 882 892

     they were too excited in the chase after you to observe it at the
     time. Now keep your eyes open in this crowd for your friends of last
     night, though I very much fear that they are a good hundred miles off
     by now."

==>      And Holmes' fears came to be realised, for from that day to this no <==
     word has ever been heard either of the beautiful woman, the sinister
     German, or the morose Englishman. Early that morning a peasant had
     met a cart containing several people and some very bulky boxes
     driving rapidly in the direction of Reading, but there all traces of
     the fugitives disappeared, and even Holmes' ingenuity failed ever to

     discover the least clue as to their whereabouts.

     The firemen had been much perturbed at the strange arrangements which
     they had found within, and still more so by discovering a newly
     severed human thumb upon a window-sill of the second floor. About

     "Well," said our engineer ruefully as we took our seats to return
     once more to London, "it has been a pretty business for me! I have
     lost my thumb and I have lost a fifty-guinea fee, and what have I
     gained?"

==>      "Experience," said Holmes, laughing. "Indirectly it may be of value, <==
     you know; you have only to put it into words to gain the reputation
     of being excellent company for the remainder of your existence."
