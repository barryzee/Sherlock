     note of it in his collection. Speaking of my old friend and

     "Middlesex Corps, no doubt."

     I smiled at his bewildered expression.

     upon his face as an English sun could never give, and with his

     "I see no more than you, but I have trained myself to notice what I
     see. However, Mr. Dodd, it was not to discuss the science of
     observation that you called upon me this morning. What has been
     happening at Tuxbury Old Park?"

==>      "Mr. Holmes--!" <==

     "My dear sir, there is no mystery. Your letter came with that
     heading, and as you fixed this appointment in very pressing terms it
     was clear that something sudden and important had occurred."

     joys and sorrows. He was my mate--and that means a good deal in the
     Army. We took the rough and the smooth together for a year of hard
     fighting. Then he was hit with a bullet from an elephant gun in the
     action near Diamond Hill outside Pretoria. I got one letter from the
     hospital at Cape Town and one from Southampton. Since then not a
==>      word--not one word, Mr. Holmes, for six months and more, and he my <==
     closest pal.

     "Well, when the war was over, and we all got back, I wrote to his
     father and asked where Godfrey was. No answer. I waited a bit and
     then I wrote again. This time I had a reply, short and gruff. Godfrey

     father and asked where Godfrey was. No answer. I waited a bit and
     then I wrote again. This time I had a reply, short and gruff. Godfrey
     had gone on a voyage round the world, and it was not likely that he
     would be back for a year. That was all.

==>      "I wasn't satisfied, Mr. Holmes. The whole thing seemed to me so <==
     damned unnatural. He was a good lad, and he would not drop a pal like
     that. It was not like him. Then, again, I happened to know that he
     was heir to a lot of money, and also that his father and he did not
     always hit it off too well. The old man was sometimes a bully, and
     young Godfrey had too much spirit to stand it. No, I wasn't

     hear something of Godfrey's past which you are in a position to tell
     her, but I would ask you to let the present and the future alone.
     Such inquiries serve no useful purpose, sir, and place us in a
     delicate and difficult position.'

==>      "So I came to a dead end, Mr. Holmes. There was no getting past it. I <==
     could only pretend to accept the situation and register a vow
     inwardly that I would never rest until my friend's fate had been
     cleared up. It was a dull evening. We dined quietly, the three of us,
     in a gloomy, faded old room. The lady questioned me eagerly about her
     son, but the old man seemed morose and depressed. I was so bored by

     in a gloomy, faded old room. The lady questioned me eagerly about her
     son, but the old man seemed morose and depressed. I was so bored by
     the whole proceeding that I made an excuse as soon as I decently
     could and retired to my bedroom. It was a large, bare room on the
     ground floor, as gloomy as the rest of the house, but after a year of
==>      sleeping upon the veldt, Mr. Holmes, one is not too particular about <==
     one's quarters. I opened the curtains and looked out into the garden,
     remarking that it was a fine night with a bright half-moon. Then I
     sat down by the roaring fire with the lamp on a table beside me, and
     endeavoured to distract my mind with a novel. I was interrupted,
     however, by Ralph, the old butler, who came in with a fresh supply of

     was dragged from his lips. It was a terrible and unexpected one.

     "'I wish to God he was!' he cried, and, tearing himself free, he
     dashed from the room.

==>      "You will think, Mr. Holmes, that I returned to my chair in no very <==
     happy state of mind. The old man's words seemed to me to bear only
     one interpretation. Clearly my poor friend had become involved in
     some criminal or, at the least, disreputable transaction which
     touched the family honour. That stern old man had sent his son away
     and hidden him from the world lest some scandal should come to light.

     My client had paused as one in deep emotion.

     "Pray continue," I said. "Your problem presents some very unusual
     features."

==>      "He was outside the window, Mr. Holmes, with his face pressed against <==
     the glass. I have told you that I looked out at the night. When I did
     so I left the curtains partly open. His figure was framed in this
     gap. The window came down to the ground and I could see the whole
     length of it, but it was his face which held my gaze. He was deadly
     pale--never have I seen a man so white. I reckon ghosts may look like

     pale--never have I seen a man so white. I reckon ghosts may look like
     that; but his eyes met mine, and they were the eyes of a living man.
     He sprang back when he saw that I was looking at him, and he vanished
     into the darkness.

==>      "There was something shocking about the man, Mr. Holmes. It wasn't <==
     merely that ghastly face glimmering as white as cheese in the
     darkness. It was more subtle than that--something slinking, something
     furtive, something guilty-- something very unlike the frank, manly
     lad that I had known. It left a feeling of horror in my mind.


[line number in individual story] matching line = 328    window = 323 333

     me something was moving ahead of me. I ran on and called his name,
     but it was no use. When I got to the end of the path there were
     several others branching in different directions to various
     outhouses. I stood hesitating, and as I did so I heard distinctly the
     sound of a closing door. It was not behind me in the house, but ahead
==>      of me, somewhere in the darkness. That was enough, Mr. Holmes, to <==
     assure me that what I had seen was not a vision. Godfrey had run away
     from me, and he had shut a door behind him. Of that I was certain.

     "There was nothing more I could do, and I spent an uneasy night
     turning the matter over in my mind and trying to find some theory

     "'The matter will not bear discussion,' said he abruptly. 'You have
     made a most damnable intrusion into the privacy of our family. You
     were here as a guest and you have become a spy. I have nothing more
     to say, sir, save that I have no wish ever to see you again.'

==>      "At this I lost my temper, Mr. Holmes, and I spoke with some warmth. <==

     "'I have seen your son, and I am convinced that for some reason of
     your own you are concealing him from the world. I have no idea what
     your motives are in cutting him off in this fashion, but I am sure
     that he is no longer a free agent. I warn you, Colonel Emsworth, that

     "What?"

     "A well-marked case of pseudo-leprosy or ichthyosis, a scale-like
     affection of the skin, unsightly, obstinate, but possibly curable,

     remarkable one. But is it coincidence? Are there not subtle forces at
     work of which we know little? Are we assured that the apprehension
     from which this young man has no doubt suffered terribly since his
     exposure to its contagion may not produce a physical effect which
     simulates that which it fears? At any rate, I pledge my professional

     I find from my notebook that it was in January, 1903, just after the

     at that time deserted me for a wife, the only selfish action which I
     can recall in our association. I was alone.

     It happened that at the moment I was clearing up the case which my

     Duke of Greyminster was so deeply involved. I had also a commission
     from the Sultan of Turkey which called for immediate action, as
     political consequences of the gravest kind might arise from its
     neglect. Therefore it was not until the beginning of the next week,
     as my diary records, that I was able to start forth on my mission to

     "This is an old friend," said I to Dodd. "It is possible that his
     presence may be entirely unnecessary, and, on the other hand, it may
     be essential. It is not necessary at the present stage to go further
     into the matter."

==>      The narratives of Watson have accustomed the reader, no doubt, to the <==
     fact that I do not waste words or disclose my thoughts while a case
     is actually under consideration. Dodd seemed surprised, but nothing
     more was said, and the three of us continued our journey together. In
     the train I asked Dodd one more question which I wished our companion
     to hear.

     little wrinkled old fellow, was in the conventional costume of black
     coat and pepper-and-salt trousers, with only one curious variant. He
     wore brown leather gloves, which at sight of us he instantly shuffled
     off, laying them down on the hall-table as we passed in. I have, as

     senses, and a faint but incisive scent was apparent. It seemed to
     centre on the hall-table. I turned, placed my hat there, knocked it
     off, stooped to pick it up, and contrived to bring my nose within a
     foot of the gloves. Yes, it was undoubtedly from them that the
     curious tarry odour was oozing. I passed on into the study with my

     Colonel Emsworth was not in his room, but he came quickly enough on
     receipt of Ralph's message. We heard his quick, heavy step in the
     passage. The door was flung open and he rushed in with bristling
     beard and twisted features, as terrible an old man as ever I have

     systematized common sense, into a prodigy. When I tell my own story I
     have no such aid. And yet I will give my process of thought even as I
     gave it to my small audience, which included Godfrey's mother in the
     study of Colonel Emsworth.
