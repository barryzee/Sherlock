     "I am inclined to think--" said I.

==>      "I should do so," Sherlock Holmes remarked impatiently. <==

     I believe that I am one of the most long-suffering of mortals; but
     I'll admit that I was annoyed at the sardonic interruption.

     I'll admit that I was annoyed at the sardonic interruption.

     times."

     He was too much absorbed with his own thoughts to give any immediate
     answer to my remonstrance. He leaned upon his hand, with his untasted
     breakfast before him, and he stared at the slip of paper which he had

     but sinister--in the highest degree sinister. That is where he comes
     within my purview. You have heard me speak of Professor Moriarty?"

     "The famous scientific criminal, as famous among crooks as--"

==>      "My blushes, Watson!" Holmes murmured in a deprecating voice. <==

     "I was about to say, as he is unknown to the public."

     "A touch! A distinct touch!" cried Holmes. "You are developing a
     certain unexpected vein of pawky humour, Watson, against which I must

     "My blushes, Watson!" Holmes murmured in a deprecating voice.

     "I was about to say, as he is unknown to the public."

==>      "A touch! A distinct touch!" cried Holmes. "You are developing a <==
     certain unexpected vein of pawky humour, Watson, against which I must
     learn to guard myself. But in calling Moriarty a criminal you are
     uttering libel in the eyes of the law--and there lie the glory and
     the wonder of it! The greatest schemer of all time, the organizer of
     every deviltry, the controlling brain of the underworld, a brain

     information which has been of value--that highest value which
     anticipates and prevents rather than avenges crime. I cannot doubt
     that, if we had the cipher, we should find that this communication is
     of the nature that I indicate."

==>      Again Holmes flattened out the paper upon his unused plate. I rose <==
     and, leaning over him, stared down at the curious inscription, which
     ran as follows:

                         534 C2 13 127 36 31 4 17 21 41

==>      "What do you make of it, Holmes?" <==

     "It is obviously an attempt to convey secret information."

     "But what is the use of a cipher message without the cipher?"

     undone. As it is, both have to go wrong before any harm comes from
     it. Our second post is now overdue, and I shall be surprised if it
     does not bring us either a further letter of explanation, or, as is
     more probable, the very volume to which these figures refer."

==>      Holmes's calculation was fulfilled within a very few minutes by the <==
     appearance of Billy, the page, with the very letter which we were
     expecting.

     "The same writing," remarked Holmes, as he opened the envelope, "and
     actually signed," he added in an exultant voice as he unfolded the

     Holmes's calculation was fulfilled within a very few minutes by the
     appearance of Billy, the page, with the very letter which we were
     expecting.

==>      "The same writing," remarked Holmes, as he opened the envelope, "and <==
     actually signed," he added in an exultant voice as he unfolded the
     epistle. "Come, we are getting on, Watson." His brow clouded,
     however, as he glanced over the contents.

     "Dear me, this is very disappointing! I fear, Watson, that all our

     "Dear me, this is very disappointing! I fear, Watson, that all our
     expectations come to nothing. I trust that the man Porlock will come
     to no harm.

==>      "Dear Mr. Holmes [he says]: <==
     "I will go no further in this matter. It is too dangerous--he
     suspects me. I can see that he suspects me. He came to me quite
     unexpectedly after I had actually addressed this envelope with the
     intention of sending you the key to the cipher. I was able to cover
     it up. If he had seen it, it would have gone hard with me. But I read

     suspicion in his eyes. Please burn the cipher message, which can now
     be of no use to you.
     "Fred Porlock."

==>      Holmes sat for some little time twisting this letter between his <==
     fingers, and frowning, as he stared into the fire.

     "After all," he said at last, "there may be nothing in it. It may be
     only his guilty conscience. Knowing himself to be a traitor, he may
     have read the accusation in the other's eyes."

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 51420    window = 51415 51425


     "No doubt," said I. "Of course." I had picked up the original cipher
     message and was bending my brows over it. "It's pretty maddening to
     think that an important secret may lie here on this slip of paper,
     and that it is beyond human power to penetrate it."

==>      Sherlock Holmes had pushed away his untasted breakfast and lit the <==
     unsavoury pipe which was the companion of his deepest meditations. "I
     wonder!" said he, leaning back and staring at the ceiling. "Perhaps
     there are points which have escaped your Machiavellian intellect. Let
     us consider the problem in the light of pure reason. This man's
     reference is to a book. That is our point of departure."

     Watson! It is finished!"

     He had spoken in jesting vein, but the twitching of his bushy
     eyebrows bespoke his disappointment and irritation. I sat helpless
     and unhappy, staring into the fire. A long silence was broken by a
==>      sudden exclamation from Holmes, who dashed at a cupboard, from which <==
     he emerged with a second yellow-covered volume in his hand.

     "We pay the price, Watson, for being too up-to-date!" he cried. "We
     are before our time, and suffer the usual penalties. Being the
     seventh of January, we have very properly laid in the new almanac. It

     seventh of January, we have very properly laid in the new almanac. It
     is more than likely that Porlock took his message from the old one.
     No doubt he would have told us so had his letter of explanation been
     written. Now let us see what page 534 has in store for us. Number
     thirteen is 'There,' which is much more promising. Number one hundred
==>      and twenty-seven is 'is'--'There is'"--Holmes's eyes were gleaming <==
     with excitement, and his thin, nervous fingers twitched as he counted
     the words--"'danger.' Ha! Ha! Capital! Put that down, Watson. 'There
     is danger-- may-- come-- very-- soon-- one.' Then we have the name
     'Douglas' --'rich-- country-- now-- at-- Birlstone-- House--
     Birlstone-- confidence-- is-- pressing.' There, Watson! What do you

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 51543    window = 51538 51548


     I was staring at the strange message which I had scrawled, as he
     deciphered it, upon a sheet of foolscap on my knee.

     "What a queer, scrambling way of expressing his meaning!" said I.

==>      "On the contrary, he has done quite remarkably well," said Holmes. <==
     "When you search a single column for words with which to express your
     meaning, you can hardly expect to get everything you want. You are
     bound to leave something to the intelligence of your correspondent.
     The purport is perfectly clear. Some deviltry is intended against one
     Douglas, whoever he may be, residing as stated, a rich country

[line number in individual story] matching line = 313    window = 308 318

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 51553    window = 51548 51558


     Douglas, whoever he may be, residing as stated, a rich country
     gentleman. He is sure--'confidence' was as near as he could get to
     'confident'--that it is pressing. There is our result--and a very
     workmanlike little bit of analysis it was!"

==>      Holmes had the impersonal joy of the true artist in his better work, <==
     even as he mourned darkly when it fell below the high level to which
     he aspired. He was still chuckling over his success when Billy swung
     open the door and Inspector MacDonald of Scotland Yard was ushered
     into the room.


[line number in individual story] matching line = 329    window = 324 334

     physical strength, while his great cranium and deep-set, lustrous
     eyes spoke no less clearly of the keen intelligence which twinkled
     out from behind his bushy eyebrows. He was a silent, precise man with
     a dour nature and a hard Aberdonian accent.

==>      Twice already in his career had Holmes helped him to attain success, <==
     his own sole reward being the intellectual joy of the problem. For
     this reason the affection and respect of the Scotchman for his
     amateur colleague were profound, and he showed them by the frankness
     with which he consulted Holmes in every difficulty. Mediocrity knows
     nothing higher than itself; but talent instantly recognizes genius,

     nothing higher than itself; but talent instantly recognizes genius,
     and MacDonald had talent enough for his profession to enable him to
     perceive that there was no humiliation in seeking the assistance of
     one who already stood alone in Europe, both in his gifts and in his
     experience. Holmes was not prone to friendship, but he was tolerant

     of the big Scotchman, and smiled at the sight of him.

     "You are an early bird, Mr. Mac," said he. "I wish you luck with your
     worm. I fear this means that there is some mischief afoot."

     worm. I fear this means that there is some mischief afoot."

     "If you said 'hope' instead of 'fear,' it would be nearer the truth,
==>      I'm thinking, Mr. Holmes," the inspector answered, with a knowing <==
     grin. "Well, maybe a wee nip would keep out the raw morning chill.
     No, I won't smoke, I thank you. I'll have to be pushing on my way;
     for the early hours of a case are the precious ones, as no man knows
     better than your own self. But--but--"

     The inspector had stopped suddenly, and was staring with a look of
     absolute amazement at a paper upon the table. It was the sheet upon
     which I had scrawled the enigmatic message.

==>      "Douglas!" he stammered. "Birlstone! What's this, Mr. Holmes? Man, <==
     it's witchcraft! Where in the name of all that is wonderful did you
     get those names?"

     "It is a cipher that Dr. Watson and I have had occasion to solve. But
     why--what's amiss with the names?"

     "I was going down to Birlstone this morning," said he. "I had come to
     ask you if you cared to come with me--you and your friend here. But
     from what you say we might perhaps be doing better work in London."

==>      "I rather think not," said Holmes. <==

     "Hang it all, Mr. Holmes!" cried the inspector. "The papers will be
     full of the Birlstone mystery in a day or two; but where's the
     mystery if there is a man in London who prophesied the crime before
     ever it occurred? We have only to lay our hands on that man, and the

     rest will follow."

     "No doubt, Mr. Mac. But how do you propose to lay your hands on the
     so-called Porlock?"

==>      MacDonald turned over the letter which Holmes had handed him. "Posted <==
     in Camberwell--that doesn't help us much. Name, you say, is assumed.
     Not much to go on, certainly. Didn't you say that you have sent him
     money?"

     "Twice."

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 51676    window = 51671 51681


     "This professor that I've heard you mention?"

     "Exactly!"

     Inspector MacDonald smiled, and his eyelid quivered as he glanced
==>      towards me. "I won't conceal from you, Mr. Holmes, that we think in <==
     the C. I. D. that you have a wee bit of a bee in your bonnet over
     this professor. I made some inquiries myself about the matter. He
     seems to be a very respectable, learned, and talented sort of man."

     "I'm glad you've got so far as to recognize the talent."

     a good Aberdeen upbringing. He'd have made a grand meenister with his
     thin face and gray hair and solemn-like way of talking. When he put
     his hand on my shoulder as we were parting, it was like a father's
     blessing before you go out into the cold, cruel world."

==>      Holmes chuckled and rubbed his hands. "Great!" he said. "Great! Tell <==
     me, Friend MacDonald, this pleasing and touching interview was, I
     suppose, in the professor's study?"

     "That's so."

     "That's so."

     "A fine room, is it not?"

     "You sat in front of his writing desk?"

     "Just so."

     face."

     "It would be. Did you happen to observe a picture over the
     professor's head?"

==>      "I don't miss much, Mr. Holmes. Maybe I learned that from you. Yes, I <==
     saw the picture--a young woman with her head on her hands, peeping at
     you sideways."

     "That painting was by Jean Baptiste Greuze."

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 51723    window = 51718 51728



     "That painting was by Jean Baptiste Greuze."

     The inspector endeavoured to look interested.

==>      "Jean Baptiste Greuze," Holmes continued, joining his finger tips and <==
     leaning well back in his chair, "was a French artist who flourished
     between the years 1750 and 1800. I allude, of course to his working
     career. Modern criticism has more than indorsed the high opinion
     formed of him by his contemporaries."

     career. Modern criticism has more than indorsed the high opinion
     formed of him by his contemporaries."

     The inspector's eyes grew abstracted. "Hadn't we better--" he said.

==>      "We are doing so," Holmes interrupted. "All that I am saying has a <==
     very direct and vital bearing upon what you have called the Birlstone
     Mystery. In fact, it may in a sense be called the very centre of it."

     MacDonald smiled feebly, and looked appealingly to me. "Your thoughts
     move a bit too quick for me, Mr. Holmes. You leave out a link or two,

     and I can't get over the gap. What in the whole wide world can be the
     connection between this dead painting man and the affair at
     Birlstone?"

     "All knowledge comes useful to the detective," remarked Holmes. "Even

     connection between this dead painting man and the affair at

==>      "All knowledge comes useful to the detective," remarked Holmes. "Even <==
     the trivial fact that in the year 1865 a picture by Greuze entitled
     La Jeune Fille a l'Agneau fetched one million two hundred thousand
     francs--more than forty thousand pounds--at the Portalis sale may
     start a train of reflection in your mind."

     francs--more than forty thousand pounds--at the Portalis sale may
     start a train of reflection in your mind."

     It was clear that it did. The inspector looked honestly interested.

==>      "I may remind you," Holmes continued, "that the professor's salary <==
     can be ascertained in several trustworthy books of reference. It is
     seven hundred a year."

     "Then how could he buy--"

     "Ay, that's remarkable," said the inspector thoughtfully. "Talk away,

     Holmes smiled. He was always warmed by genuine admiration--the
     characteristic of the real artist. "What about Birlstone?" he asked.

     "We've time yet," said the inspector, glancing at his watch. "I've a

     more than interesting--it's just wonderful. But let us have it a
     little clearer if you can. Is it forgery, coining, burglary--where
     does the money come from?"

     conversation proceeded. He had lost himself in his interest. Now his
     practical Scotch intelligence brought him back with a snap to the
     matter in hand.

     "He can keep, anyhow," said he. "You've got us side-tracked with your

     that there is some connection between the professor and the crime.
     That you get from the warning received through the man Porlock. Can
     we for our present practical needs get any further than that?"

     "We may form some conception as to the motives of the crime. It is,

     the arch-criminal's subordinates--had in some way betrayed the chief.
     His punishment followed, and would be known to all--if only to put
     the fear of death into them."

     "The other is that it has been engineered by Moriarty in the ordinary

     "Then to Birlstone we must go!" cried MacDonald, jumping from his
     chair. "My word! it's later than I thought. I can give you,
     gentlemen, five minutes for preparation, and that is all."

     change from his dressing gown to his coat. "While we are on our way,
     Mr. Mac, I will ask you to be good enough to tell me all about it."

     "All about it" proved to be disappointingly little, and yet there was
     enough to assure us that the case before us might well be worthy of

     was a fitting object for those remarkable powers which, like all
     special gifts, become irksome to their owner when they are not in

     and his whole eager face shone with an inward light when the call for
     work reached him. Leaning forward in the cab, he listened intently to
     MacDonald's short sketch of the problem which awaited us in Sussex.
     The inspector was himself dependent, as he explained to us, upon a
     scribbled account forwarded to him by the milk train in the early

     "Dear Inspector MacDonald [said the letter which he read to us]:

     is for your private eye. Wire me what train in the morning you can
     get for Birlstone, and I will meet it--or have it met if I am too

     have the pressmen down like flies when they understand it. I'm hoping
     we will get our work done before they get poking their noses into it
     and messing up all the trails. There has been nothing like this that

     fluting between the barrels, and the rest of the name had been cut
     off by the saw."

     most noisy weapon he could select, knowing well that it will fetch
     every human being in the house to the spot as quick as they can run,

     He impressed me, this country specialist. He had a solid grip of fact

     cardboard. Have you any of the sort in the house?"

     "I don't think so."

     bottle on to the blotting paper. "It was not printed in this room,"
     he said; "this is black ink and the other purplish. It was done by a
     thick pen, and these are fine. No, it was done elsewhere, I should
     say. Can you make anything of the inscription, Ames?"

     for a wet stranger?"

     "Well, unless he has a burrow close by or a change of clothes ready,
     they can hardly miss him. And yet they have missed him up to now!"
     Holmes had gone to the window and was examining with his lens the

     remarkably broad; a splay-foot, one would say. Curious, because, so
     far as one can trace any footmark in this mud-stained corner, one
     would say it was a more shapely sole. However, they are certainly
     very indistinct. What's this under the side table?"

     "Dumb-bell--there's only one. Where's the other?"

==>      "I don't know, Mr. Holmes. There may have been only one. I have not <==

     "One dumb-bell--" Holmes said seriously; but his remarks were
     interrupted by a sharp knock at the door.

     A tall, sunburned, capable-looking, clean-shaved man looked in at us.
     I had no difficulty in guessing that it was the Cecil Barker of whom

     these things were numbered and registered. But we must be thankful
     for what we've got. If we can't find where he went to, at least we
     are likely to get where he came from. But what in the name of all
     that is wonderful made the fellow leave it behind? And how in the
     world has he got away without it? We don't seem to get a gleam of

     "Don't we?" my friend answered thoughtfully. "I wonder!"

     "Have you seen all you want of the study?" asked White Mason as we

==>      "For the time," said the inspector, and Holmes nodded. <==

     "Then perhaps you would now like to hear the evidence of some of the
     people in the house. We could use the dining-room, Ames. Please come
     yourself first and tell us what you know."

     "I don't know that I've anything else to ask you at present," said
     MacDonald, coldly.

==>      "There was one small point," remarked Sherlock Holmes. "When you <==
     entered the room there was only a candle lighted on the table, was
     there not?"

     "Yes, that was so."

     "And yet when they arrived they found that the candle was out and
     that the lamp had been lighted. That seems very remarkable."

     Again Barker showed some signs of indecision. "I don't see that it
==>      was remarkable, Mr. Holmes," he answered after a pause. "The candle <==
     threw a very bad light. My first thought was to get a better one. The
     lamp was on the table; so I lit it."

     "And blew out the candle?"

     "And blew out the candle?"

==>      Holmes asked no further question, and Barker, with a deliberate look <==
     from one to the other of us, which had, as it seemed to me, something
     of defiance in it, turned and left the room.

     Inspector MacDonald had sent up a note to the effect that he would
     wait upon Mrs. Douglas in her room; but she had replied that she

     powerful enemies, that he believed they were on his track, and that
     he was always on his guard against them. I was so sure of it that for
     years I have been terrified if ever he came home later than was
     expected."

==>      "Might I ask," asked Holmes, "what the words were which attracted <==
     your attention?"

     "The Valley of Fear," the lady answered. "That was an expression he
     has used when I questioned him. 'I have been in the Valley of Fear. I

     thoughtfully, after the door had closed behind her. "This man Barker
     has certainly been down here a good deal. He is a man who might be
     attractive to a woman. He admits that the dead man was jealous, and
     maybe he knew best himself what cause he had for jealousy. Then
     there's that wedding ring. You can't get past that. The man who tears
==>      a wedding ring off a dead man's--What do you say to it, Mr. Holmes?" <==

     My friend had sat with his head upon his hands, sunk in the deepest
     thought. Now he rose and rang the bell. "Ames," he said, when the
     butler entered, "where is Mr. Cecil Barker now?"

     He came back in a moment to say that Barker was in the garden.

     "Can you remember, Ames, what Mr. Barker had on his feet last night
     when you joined him in the study?"

==>      "Yes, Mr. Holmes. He had a pair of bedroom slippers. I brought him <==
     his boots when he went for the police."

     "Where are the slippers now?"

     "They are still under the chair in the hall."

     with blood--so indeed were my own."

     "That is natural enough, considering the condition of the room. Very
     good, Ames. We will ring if we want you."

==>      A few minutes later we were in the study. Holmes had brought with him <==
     the carpet slippers from the hall. As Ames had observed, the soles of
     both were dark with blood.

     "Strange!" murmured Holmes, as he stood in the light of the window
     and examined them minutely. "Very strange indeed!"

     A few minutes later we were in the study. Holmes had brought with him

     and examined them minutely. "Very strange indeed!"

     Stooping with one of his quick feline pounces, he placed the slipper
     upon the blood mark on the sill. It exactly corresponded. He smiled
     in silence at his colleagues.

     rattled like a stick upon railings.

     "Man," he cried, "there's not a doubt of it! Barker has just marked
     the window himself. It's a good deal broader than any bootmark. I
     mind that you said it was a splay-foot, and here's the explanation.
==>      But what's the game, Mr. Holmes--what's the game?" <==

     "Ay, what's the game?" my friend repeated thoughtfully.

     White Mason chuckled and rubbed his fat hands together in his
     professional satisfaction. "I said it was a snorter!" he cried. "And

     I bowed with a coldness which showed, I dare say, very plainly the
     impression which had been produced upon my mind.

     "We thought that it was probably you, as your friendship with Mr.

     speaking to Mrs. Douglas for one instant?"

     I followed him with a dour face. Very clearly I could see in my
     mind's eye that shattered figure on the floor. Here within a few
     hours of the tragedy were his wife and his nearest friend laughing

     "Exactly," said I, "and so I will beg leave to resume my walk."

     "One moment, Dr. Watson," cried the woman in a pleading voice. "There
     is one question which you can answer with more authority than anyone
     else in the world, and it may make a very great difference to me. You

     else can. Supposing that a matter were brought confidentially to his
     knowledge, is it absolutely necessary that he should pass it on to
     the detectives?"

     "Yes, that's it," said Barker eagerly. "Is he on his own or is he

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 53406    window = 53401 53411



     There was such a ring of sincerity in the woman's voice that for the
     instant I forgot all about her levity and was moved only to do her
     will.

==>      "Mr. Holmes is an independent investigator," I said. "He is his own <==
     master, and would act as his own judgment directed. At the same time,
     he would naturally feel loyalty towards the officials who were
     working on the same case, and he would not conceal from them anything
     which would help them in bringing a criminal to justice. Beyond this
     I can say nothing, and I would refer you to Mr. Holmes himself if you

     So saying I raised my hat and went upon my way, leaving them still
     seated behind that concealing hedge. I looked back as I rounded the
     far end of it, and saw that they were still talking very earnestly

     seated behind that concealing hedge. I looked back as I rounded the
     far end of it, and saw that they were still talking very earnestly
     together, and, as they were gazing after me, it was clear that it was
     our interview that was the subject of their debate.

==>      "I wish none of their confidences," said Holmes, when I reported to <==
     him what had occurred. He had spent the whole afternoon at the Manor
     House in consultation with his two colleagues, and returned about
     five with a ravenous appetite for a high tea which I had ordered for
     him. "No confidences, Watson; for they are mighty awkward if it comes
     to an arrest for conspiracy and murder."

     "You think then, definitely, that Barker and Mrs. Douglas are guilty
     of the murder?"

     "There is an appalling directness about your questions, Watson," said
==>      Holmes, shaking his pipe at me. "They come at me like bullets. If you <==
     put it that Mrs. Douglas and Barker know the truth about the murder,
     and are conspiring to conceal it, then I can give you a whole-souled
     answer. I am sure they do. But your more deadly proposition is not so
     clear. Let us for a moment consider the difficulties which stand in
     the way.

     upon this point, and conspire to murder the husband. He happens to be
     a man over whose head some danger hangs--"

     "We have only their word for that."

     theory by which everything they say from the beginning is false.
     According to your idea, there was never any hidden menace, or secret
     society, or Valley of Fear, or Boss MacSomebody, or anything else.
     Well, that is a good sweeping generalization. Let us see what that
     brings us to. They invent this theory to account for the crime. They

     "Man, I'll admeet that I had my doubts if there was ever an
     outsider," said MacDonald, "but that's all past now. We've had the
     bicycle identified, and we have a description of our man; so that's a
     long step on our journey."

==>      "It sounds to me like the beginning of the end," said Holmes. "I'm <==
     sure I congratulate you both with all my heart."

     "Well, I started from the fact that Mr. Douglas had seemed disturbed
     since the day before, when he had been at Tunbridge Wells. It was at
     Tunbridge Wells then that he had become conscious of some danger. It

     days before. This bicycle and a small valise were his whole
     belongings. He had registered his name as coming from London, but had
     given no address. The valise was London made, and the contents were
     British; but the man himself was undoubtedly an American."

==>      "Well, well," said Holmes gleefully, "you have indeed done some solid <==
     work while I have been sitting spinning theories with my friend! It's
     a lesson in being practical, Mr. Mac."

     "Ay, it's just that, Mr. Holmes," said the inspector with
     satisfaction.

     marking upon the clothes. A cycle map of the county lay on his
     bedroom table. He had left the hotel after breakfast yesterday
     morning on his bicycle, and no more was heard of him until our
     inquiries."

==>      "That's what puzzles me, Mr. Holmes," said White Mason. "If the <==
     fellow did not want the hue and cry raised over him, one would
     imagine that he would have returned and remained at the hotel as an
     inoffensive tourist. As it is, he must know that he will be reported
     to the police by the hotel manager and that his disappearance will be
     connected with the murder."

     them described as fierce and forbidding."

     "Well, bar the expression, that might almost be a description of
==>      Douglas himself," said Holmes. "He is just over fifty, with grizzled <==
     hair and moustache, and about the same height. Did you get anything
     else?"

     "He was dressed in a heavy gray suit with a reefer jacket, and he
     wore a short yellow overcoat and a soft cap."

     his valise. He could have carried it inside his overcoat without
     difficulty."

     "And how do you consider that all this bears upon the general case?"

==>      "Well, Mr. Holmes," said MacDonald, "when we have got our man--and <==
     you may be sure that I had his description on the wires within five
     minutes of hearing it--we shall be better able to judge. But, even as
     it stands, we have surely gone a long way. We know that an American
     calling himself Hargrave came to Tunbridge Wells two days ago with
     bicycle and valise. In the latter was a sawed-off shotgun; so he came

     had intended to use it outside, and there it has very obvious
     advantages, as it would be impossible to miss with it, and the sound
     of shots is so common in an English sporting neighbourhood that no
     particular notice would be taken."

==>      "That is all very clear," said Holmes. <==

     "Well, Mr. Douglas did not appear. What was he to do next? He left
     his bicycle and approached the house in the twilight. He found the
     bridge down and no one about. He took his chance, intending, no
     doubt, to make some excuse if he met anyone. He met no one. He

     quarter-past eleven, when Mr. Douglas upon his usual nightly round
     came into the room. He shot him and escaped, as arranged. He was
     aware that the bicycle would be described by the hotel people and be
     a clue against him; so he left it there and made his way by some
     other means to London or to some safe hiding place which he had

     "Well, Mr. Mac, it is very good and very clear so far as it goes.
     That is your end of the story. My end is that the crime was committed
     half an hour earlier than reported; that Mrs. Douglas and Barker are
     both in a conspiracy to conceal something; that they aided the

     lowering the bridge. That's my reading of the first half."

     The two detectives shook their heads.

     into another," said the London inspector.

     was partly awakened by his entrance.

     "Well, Holmes," I murmured, "have you found anything out?"

     It was late that night when Holmes returned from his solitary
     excursion. We slept in a double-bedded room, which was the best that
     the little country inn could do for us. I was already asleep when I
     was partly awakened by his entrance.

==>      "Well, Holmes," I murmured, "have you found anything out?" <==

     He stood beside me in silence, his candle in his hand. Then the tall,
     lean figure inclined towards me. "I say, Watson," he whispered,
     "would you be afraid to sleep in the same room with a lunatic, a man
     with softening of the brain, an idiot whose mind has lost its grip?"

     Mason seated in close consultation in the small parlour of the local
     police sergeant. On the table in front of them were piled a number of
     letters and telegrams, which they were carefully sorting and
     docketing. Three had been placed on one side.

==>      "Still on the track of the elusive bicyclist?" Holmes asked <==
     cheerfully. "What is the latest news of the ruffian?"

     MacDonald pointed ruefully to his heap of correspondence.

     "He is at present reported from Leicester, Nottingham, Southampton,

     Derby, East Ham, Richmond, and fourteen other places. In three of
     them--East Ham, Leicester, and Liverpool--there is a clear case
     against him, and he has actually been arrested. The country seems to
     be full of the fugitives with yellow coats."

==>      "Dear me!" said Holmes sympathetically. "Now, Mr. Mac and you, Mr. <==
     White Mason, I wish to give you a very earnest piece of advice. When
     I went into this case with you I bargained, as you will no doubt
     remember, that I should not present you with half-proved theories,
     but that I should retain and work out my own ideas until I had
     satisfied myself that they were correct. For this reason I am not at

     "Yes, yes, no doubt he is somewhere, and no doubt we shall get him;
     but I would not have you waste your energies in East Ham or
     Liverpool. I am sure that we can find some shorter cut to a result."

     "You are holding something back. It's hardly fair of you, Mr.
==>      Holmes." The inspector was annoyed. <==

     "You know my methods of work, Mr. Mac. But I will hold it back for
     the shortest time possible. I only wish to verify my details in one
     way, which can very readily be done, and then I make my bow and
     return to London, leaving my results entirely at your service. I owe

     way, which can very readily be done, and then I make my bow and
     return to London, leaving my results entirely at your service. I owe
     you too much to act otherwise; for in all my experience I cannot
     recall any more singular and interesting study."

==>      "This is clean beyond me, Mr. Holmes. We saw you when we returned <==
     from Tunbridge Wells last night, and you were in general agreement
     with our results. What has happened since then to give you a
     completely new idea of the case?"

     "Well, since you ask me, I spent, as I told you that I would, some

     "Ah, I can only give you a very general answer to that for the
     moment. By the way, I have been reading a short but clear and
     interesting account of the old building, purchasable at the modest
     sum of one penny from the local tobacconist."

==>      Here Holmes drew a small tract, embellished with a rude engraving of <==
     the ancient Manor House, from his waistcoat pocket.

     "It immensely adds to the zest of an investigation, my dear Mr. Mac,
     when one is in conscious sympathy with the historical atmosphere of
     one's surroundings. Don't look so impatient; for I assure you that

     past in one's mind. Permit me to give you a sample. 'Erected in the
     fifth year of the reign of James I, and standing upon the site of a
     much older building, the Manor House of Birlstone presents one of the
     finest surviving examples of the moated Jacobean residence--' "

==>      "You are making fools of us, Mr. Holmes!" <==

     "Tut, tut, Mr. Mac!--the first sign of temper I have detected in you.
     Well, I won't read it verbatim, since you feel so strongly upon the
     subject. But when I tell you that there is some account of the taking
     of the place by a parliamentary colonel in 1644, of the concealment

     of Charles for several days in the course of the Civil War, and
     finally of a visit there by the second George, you will admit that
     there are various associations of interest connected with this
     ancient house."

==>      "I don't doubt it, Mr. Holmes; but that is no business of ours." <==

     "Is it not? Is it not? Breadth of view, my dear Mr. Mac, is one of
     the essentials of our profession. The interplay of ideas and the
     oblique uses of knowledge are often of extraordinary interest. You
     will excuse these remarks from one who, though a mere connoisseur of

     "Well, I'm bound to say I've always found you had reason behind all
     your queer ways. I'll do what you advise."

     "And you, Mr. White Mason?"

==>      The country detective looked helplessly from one to the other. Holmes <==
     and his methods were new to him. "Well, if it is good enough for the
     inspector, it is good enough for me," he said at last.

     "Capital!" said Holmes. "Well, then, I should recommend a nice,

     happy--"

     "Man, this is getting past a joke!" cried MacDonald, rising angrily
     from his chair.

==>      "Well, well, spend the day as you like," said Holmes, patting him <==
     cheerfully upon the shoulder. "Do what you like and go where you
     will, but meet me here before dusk without fail--without fail, Mr.
     Mac."

     "That sounds more like sanity."

     "Now sign that, and send it by hand about four o'clock. At that hour
     we shall meet again in this room. Until then we may each do what we
     like; for I can assure you that this inquiry has come to a definite
     pause."

==>      Evening was drawing in when we reassembled. Holmes was very serious <==
     in his manner, myself curious, and the detectives obviously critical
     and annoyed.

     "Well, gentlemen," said my friend gravely, "I am asking you now to
     put everything to the test with me, and you will judge for yourselves

     it grows dark; so with your permission we shall get started at once."

     We passed along the outer bounds of the Manor House park until we
     came to a place where there was a gap in the rails which fenced it.
     Through this we slipped, and then in the gathering gloom we followed
==>      Holmes until we had reached a shrubbery which lies nearly opposite to <==
     the main door and the drawbridge. The latter had not been raised.
     Holmes crouched down behind the screen of laurels, and we all three
     followed his example.

     "Well, what are we to do now?" asked MacDonald with some gruffness.

     calls insistently for a well-staged performance. Surely our

     Everything else was dark and still.

     "How long is this to last?" asked the inspector finally. "And what is
     it we are watching for?"

==>      "I have no more notion than you how long it is to last," Holmes <==
     answered with some asperity. "If criminals would always schedule
     their movements like railway trains, it would certainly be more
     convenient for all of us. As to what it is we--Well, that's what we
     are watching for!"

     stirring up the moat with something which he held in his hand. Then
     suddenly he hauled something in as a fisherman lands a fish--some
     large, round object which obscured the light as it was dragged
     through the open casement.

==>      "Now!" cried Holmes. "Now!" <==

     We were all upon our feet, staggering after him with our stiffened
     limbs, while he ran swiftly across the bridge and rang violently at
     the bell. There was the rasping of bolts from the other side, and the
     amazed Ames stood in the entrance. Holmes brushed him aside without a

     word and, followed by all of us, rushed into the room which had been
     occupied by the man whom we had been watching.

     The oil lamp on the table represented the glow which we had seen from
     outside. It was now in the hand of Cecil Barker, who held it towards

     clean-shaved face and his menacing eyes.

     "What the devil is the meaning of all this?" he cried. "What are you
     after, anyhow?"

==>      Holmes took a swift glance round, and then pounced upon a sodden <==
     bundle tied together with cord which lay where it had been thrust
     under the writing table.

     "This is what we are after, Mr. Barker--this bundle, weighted with a
     dumb-bell, which you have just raised from the bottom of the moat."

     under the writing table.

     "This is what we are after, Mr. Barker--this bundle, weighted with a
     dumb-bell, which you have just raised from the bottom of the moat."

==>      Barker stared at Holmes with amazement in his face. "How in thunder <==
     came you to know anything about it?" he asked.

     "Simply that I put it there."

     "You put it there! You!"

     "Simply that I put it there."

     "You put it there! You!"

==>      "Perhaps I should have said 'replaced it there,'" said Holmes. "You <==
     will remember, Inspector MacDonald, that I was somewhat struck by the
     absence of a dumb-bell. I drew your attention to it; but with the
     pressure of other events you had hardly the time to give it the
     consideration which would have enabled you to draw deductions from
     it. When water is near and a weight is missing it is not a very

     most certainly withdraw it the moment that darkness enabled him to do
     so. We have no less than four witnesses as to who it was who took
     advantage of the opportunity, and so, Mr. Barker, I think the word
     lies now with you."

==>      Sherlock Holmes put the sopping bundle upon the table beside the lamp <==
     and undid the cord which bound it. From within he extracted a
     dumb-bell, which he tossed down to its fellow in the corner. Next he
     drew forth a pair of boots. "American, as you perceive," he remarked,
     pointing to the toes. Then he laid upon the table a long, deadly,
     sheathed knife. Finally he unravelled a bundle of clothing,

     pointing to the toes. Then he laid upon the table a long, deadly,
     sheathed knife. Finally he unravelled a bundle of clothing,
     comprising a complete set of underclothes, socks, a gray tweed suit,
     and a short yellow overcoat.

==>      "The clothes are commonplace," remarked Holmes, "save only the <==
     overcoat, which is full of suggestive touches." He held it tenderly
     towards the light. "Here, as you perceive, is the inner pocket
     prolonged into the lining in such fashion as to give ample space for
     the truncated fowling piece. The tailor's tab is on the neck--'Neal,
     Outfitter, Vermissa, U. S. A.' I have spent an instructive afternoon

     It was a sight to see Cecil Barker's expressive face during this
     exposition of the great detective. Anger, amazement, consternation,
     and indecision swept over it in turn. Finally he took refuge in a
     somewhat acrid irony.

==>      "You know such a lot, Mr. Holmes, perhaps you had better tell us some <==
     more," he sneered.

     "I have no doubt that I could tell you a great deal more, Mr. Barker;
     but it would come with a better grace from you."

     door, and now she entered the room.

     "You have done enough for now, Cecil," said she. "Whatever comes of
     it in the future, you have done enough."

==>      "Enough and more than enough," remarked Sherlock Holmes gravely. "I <==
     have every sympathy with you, madam, and should strongly urge you to
     have some confidence in the common sense of our jurisdiction and to
     take the police voluntarily into your complete confidence. It may be
     that I am myself at fault for not following up the hint which you
     conveyed to me through my friend, Dr. Watson; but, at that time I had

     every reason to believe that you were directly concerned in the
     crime. Now I am assured that this is not so. At the same time, there
     is much that is unexplained, and I should strongly recommend that you
     ask Mr. Douglas to tell us his own story."

==>      Mrs. Douglas gave a cry of astonishment at Holmes's words. The <==
     detectives and I must have echoed it, when we were aware of a man who
     seemed to have emerged from the wall, who advanced now from the gloom
     of the corner in which he had appeared. Mrs. Douglas turned, and in
     an instant her arms were round him. Barker had seized his
     outstretched hand.

     outstretched hand.

     "It's best this way, Jack," his wife repeated; "I am sure that it is
     best."

==>      "Indeed, yes, Mr. Douglas," said Sherlock Holmes, "I am sure that you <==
     will find it best."

     The man stood blinking at us with the dazed look of one who comes
     from the dark into the light. It was a remarkable face, bold gray
     eyes, a strong, short-clipped, grizzled moustache, a square,

     cooped up two days, and I've spent the daylight hours--as much
     daylight as I could get in that rat trap--in putting the thing into
     words. You're welcome to them--you and your public. There's the story
     of the Valley of Fear."

==>      "That's the past, Mr. Douglas," said Sherlock Holmes quietly. "What <==
     we desire now is to hear your story of the present."

     "You'll have it, sir," said Douglas. "May I smoke as I talk? Well,

     concealment of King Charles. People did not hide in those days
     without excellent hiding places, and the hiding place that has once
     been used may be again. I had persuaded myself that we should find
     Mr. Douglas under this roof."

==>      "And how long have you been playing this trick upon us, Mr. Holmes?" <==
     said the inspector angrily. "How long have you allowed us to waste
     ourselves upon a search that you knew to be an absurd one?"

     "Not one instant, my dear Mr. Mac. Only last night did I form my
     views of the case. As they could not be put to the proof until this

     married, and it would have taken a file to get it off. I don't know,
     anyhow, that I should have cared to part with it; but if I had wanted
     to I couldn't. So we just had to leave that detail to take care of
     itself. On the other hand, I brought a bit of plaster down and put it
     where I am wearing one myself at this instant. You slipped up there,
==>      Mr. Holmes, clever as you are; for if you had chanced to take off <==
     that plaster you would have found no cut underneath it.

     "Well, that was the situation. If I could lie low for a while and
     then get away where I could be joined by my 'widow' we should have a
     chance at last of living in peace for the rest of our lives. These

     bell for all he was worth. What happened afterward you know. And so,
     gentlemen, you can do what you please; but I've told you the truth
     and the whole truth, so help me God! What I ask you now is how do I
     stand by the English law?"

==>      There was a silence which was broken by Sherlock Holmes. <==

     "The English law is in the main a just law. You will get no worse
     than your deserts from that, Mr. Douglas. But I would ask you how did
     this man know that you lived here, or how to get into your house, or
     where to hide to get you?"

     "I know nothing of this."

     fear," said he. "You may find worse dangers than the English law, or
     even than your enemies from America. I see trouble before you, Mr.
     Douglas. You'll take my advice and still be on your guard."

     And now, my long-suffering readers, I will ask you to come away with

     The police trial had passed, in which the case of John Douglas was
     referred to a higher court. So had the Quarter Sessions, at which he
     was acquitted as having acted in self-defense.

==>      "Get him out of England at any cost," wrote Holmes to the wife. <==
     "There are forces here which may be more dangerous than those he has
     escaped. There is no safety for your husband in England."

     Two months had gone by, and the case had to some extent passed from
     our minds. Then one morning there came an enigmatic note slipped into

     the quaint message; but Holmes showed unwonted seriousness.

     "Deviltry, Watson!" he remarked, and sat long with a clouded brow.

     Barker, our friend of the moated Manor House. His face was drawn and

     "So I think also. These infernal Scowrers, this cursed vindictive

     tell an old master by the sweep of his brush. I can tell a Moriarty
     when I see one. This crime is from London, not from America."

     Barker beat his head with his clenched fist in his impotent anger.

     "Do you tell me that we have to sit down under this? Do you say that
     no one can ever get level with this king-devil?"

==>      "No, I don't say that," said Holmes, and his eyes seemed to be <==
     looking far into the future. "I don't say that he can't be beat. But
     you must give me time--you must give me time!"

     We all sat in silence for some minutes, while those fateful eyes
     still strained to pierce the veil.

==>      "Excuse me, sir," said he, "but am I addressing Dr. Watson?" <==

     I bowed with a coldness which showed, I dare say, very plainly the
     impression which had been produced upon my mind.

     "We thought that it was probably you, as your friendship with Mr.

     I shrugged my shoulders. "It is no business of mine," said I.

     "Perhaps some day you will do me justice. If you only realized--"

==>      "There is no need why Dr. Watson should realize," said Barker <==
     quickly. "As he has himself said, it is no possible business of his."

     "Exactly," said I, "and so I will beg leave to resume my walk."

     "One moment, Dr. Watson," cried the woman in a pleading voice. "There

     is one question which you can answer with more authority than anyone
     else in the world, and it may make a very great difference to me. You
     know Mr. Holmes and his relations with the police better than anyone
     else can. Supposing that a matter were brought confidentially to his
     knowledge, is it absolutely necessary that he should pass it on to

     "I really don't know that I should be justified in discussing such a
     point."

==>      "I beg--I implore that you will, Dr. Watson! I assure you that you <==
     will be helping us--helping me greatly if you will guide us on that
     point."

     There was such a ring of sincerity in the woman's voice that for the
     instant I forgot all about her levity and was moved only to do her

     "I wish none of their confidences," said Holmes, when I reported to
     him what had occurred. He had spent the whole afternoon at the Manor
     House in consultation with his two colleagues, and returned about
     five with a ravenous appetite for a high tea which I had ordered for

     "You think it will come to that?"

     mental concentration. Finally he lit his pipe, and sitting in the
     inglenook of the old village inn he talked slowly and at random about
     his case, rather as one who thinks aloud than as one who makes a
     considered statement.

==>      "A lie, Watson--a great, big, thumping, obtrusive, uncompromising <==
     lie--that's what meets us on the threshold! There is our starting
     point. The whole story told by Barker is a lie. But Barker's story is
     corroborated by Mrs. Douglas. Therefore she is lying also. They are
     both lying, and in a conspiracy. So now we have the clear problem.

     the lie and reconstruct the truth.

     "How do I know that they are lying? Because it is a clumsy
     fabrication which simply could not be true. Consider! According to
     the story given to us, the assassin had less than a minute after the

     ring, from the dead man's finger, to replace the other ring--a thing
     which he would surely never have done--and to put that singular card
     beside his victim. I say that this was obviously impossible.

     "You may argue--but I have too much respect for your judgment,
==>      Watson, to think that you will do so--that the ring may have been <==
     taken before the man was killed. The fact that the candle had been
     lit only a short time shows that there had been no lengthy interview.
     Was Douglas, from what we hear of his fearless character, a man who
     would be likely to give up his wedding ring at such short notice, or
     could we conceive of his giving it up at all? No, no, Watson, the

     between those two people. She must be a heartless creature to sit
     laughing at some jest within a few hours of her husband's murder."

     "Exactly. She does not shine as a wife even in her own account of
     what occurred. I am not a whole-souled admirer of womankind, as you

     prearranged conspiracy to my mind."

     "You think then, definitely, that Barker and Mrs. Douglas are guilty
     of the murder?"

     Holmes, shaking his pipe at me. "They come at me like bullets. If you
     put it that Mrs. Douglas and Barker know the truth about the murder,
     and are conspiring to conceal it, then I can give you a whole-souled
     answer. I am sure they do. But your more deadly proposition is not so
     clear. Let us for a moment consider the difficulties which stand in

     upon this point, and conspire to murder the husband. He happens to be
     a man over whose head some danger hangs--"

     "We have only their word for that."

==>      Holmes looked thoughtful. "I see, Watson. You are sketching out a <==
     theory by which everything they say from the beginning is false.
     According to your idea, there was never any hidden menace, or secret
     society, or Valley of Fear, or Boss MacSomebody, or anything else.
     Well, that is a good sweeping generalization. Let us see what that
     brings us to. They invent this theory to account for the crime. They

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 53579    window = 53574 53584


     brings us to. They invent this theory to account for the crime. They
     then play up to the idea by leaving this bicycle in the park as proof
     of the existence of some outsider. The stain on the windowsill
     conveys the same idea. So does the card on the body, which might have
     been prepared in the house. That all fits into your hypothesis,
==>      Watson. But now we come on the nasty, angular, uncompromising bits <==
     which won't slip into their places. Why a cut-off shotgun of all
     weapons--and an American one at that? How could they be so sure that
     the sound of it would not bring someone on to them? It's a mere
     chance as it is that Mrs. Allen did not start out to inquire for the
     slamming door. Why did your guilty couple do all this, Watson?"

     "I propose to go up there presently. I have arranged it with the

     shall sit in that room and see if its atmosphere brings me
     inspiration. I'm a believer in the genius loci. You smile, Friend

     little investigation of my own to-night, and it is just possible that
     it may contribute something to the common cause."

     "Can we help you, Mr. Holmes?"

     Ames, the faithful Ames, no doubt he will stretch a point for me. All
     my lines of thought lead me back invariably to the one basic
     question--why should an athletic man develop his frame upon so
     unnatural an instrument as a single dumb-bell?"

     was partly awakened by his entrance.

     "Well, Holmes," I murmured, "have you found anything out?"

     He stood beside me in silence, his candle in his hand. Then the tall,

     "would you be afraid to sleep in the same room with a lunatic, a man
     with softening of the brain, an idiot whose mind has lost its grip?"

     "Not in the least," I answered in astonishment.

     Holmes answered.

     "What are we here for at all? I really think that you might treat us
     with more frankness."

==>      Holmes laughed. "Watson insists that I am the dramatist in real <==
     life," said he. "Some touch of the artist wells up within me, and
     calls insistently for a well-staged performance. Surely our
     profession, Mr. Mac, would be a drab and sordid one if we did not
     sometimes set the scene so as to glorify our results. The blunt
     accusation, the brutal tap upon the shoulder--what can one make of

     pressure of other events you had hardly the time to give it the
     consideration which would have enabled you to draw deductions from
     it. When water is near and a weight is missing it is not a very
     far-fetched supposition that something has been sunk in the water.
     The idea was at least worth testing; so with the help of Ames, who

     was able last night to fish up and inspect this bundle.

     "It was of the first importance, however, that we should be able to
     prove who placed it there. This we accomplished by the very obvious
     device of announcing that the moat would be dried to-morrow, which

     "Enough and more than enough," remarked Sherlock Holmes gravely. "I
     have every sympathy with you, madam, and should strongly urge you to
     have some confidence in the common sense of our jurisdiction and to
     take the police voluntarily into your complete confidence. It may be
     that I am myself at fault for not following up the hint which you

     every reason to believe that you were directly concerned in the
     crime. Now I am assured that this is not so. At the same time, there
     is much that is unexplained, and I should strongly recommend that you
     ask Mr. Douglas to tell us his own story."

     and then to my amazement he advanced to me and handed me a bundle of
     paper.

     "I've heard of you," said he in a voice which was not quite English
     and not quite American, but was altogether mellow and pleasing. "You

     last dollar on that. Tell it your own way; but there are the facts,
     and you can't miss the public so long as you have those. I've been

     our minds. Then one morning there came an enigmatic note slipped into
     our letter box. "Dear me, Mr. Holmes. Dear me!" said this singular
     epistle. There was neither superscription nor signature. I laughed at
     the quaint message; but Holmes showed unwonted seriousness.

==>      "Deviltry, Watson!" he remarked, and sat long with a clouded brow. <==

     Late last night Mrs. Hudson, our landlady, brought up a message that
     a gentleman wished to see Holmes, and that the matter was of the
     utmost importance. Close at the heels of his messenger came Cecil
     Barker, our friend of the moated Manor House. His face was drawn and

     a gentleman wished to see Holmes, and that the matter was of the
     utmost importance. Close at the heels of his messenger came Cecil
     Barker, our friend of the moated Manor House. His face was drawn and
     haggard.
