     "Well, Mrs. Warren, I cannot see that you have any particular cause
     for uneasiness, nor do I understand why I, whose time is of some
     value, should interfere in the matter. I really have other things to
==>      engage me." So spoke Sherlock Holmes and turned back to the great <==
     scrapbook in which he was arranging and indexing some of his recent
     material.

     But the landlady had the pertinacity and also the cunning of her sex.
      She held her ground firmly.

     "But he would never cease talking of it--your kindness, sir, and the
     way in which you brought light into the darkness. I remembered his
     words when I was in doubt and darkness myself. I know you could if
     you only would."

==>      Holmes was accessible upon the side of flattery, and also, to do him <==
     justice, upon the side of kindliness. The two forces made him lay
     down his gum-brush with a sigh of resignation and push back his
     chair.

     "Well, well, Mrs. Warren, let us hear about it, then.  You don't

     object to tobacco, I take it? Thank you, Watson--the matches! You are
     uneasy, as I understand, because your new lodger remains in his rooms
     and you cannot see him. Why, bless you, Mrs. Warren, if I were your
     lodger you often would not see me for weeks on end."

==>      "No doubt, sir; but this is different. It frightens me, Mr. Holmes. I <==
     can't sleep for fright. To hear his quick step moving here and moving
     there from early morning to late at night, and yet never to catch so
     much as a glimpse of him--it's more than I can stand. My husband is
     as nervous over it as I am, but he is out at his work all day, while
     I get no rest from it. What is he hiding for? What has he done?

     as nervous over it as I am, but he is out at his work all day, while
     I get no rest from it. What is he hiding for? What has he done?
     Except for the girl, I am all alone in the house with him, and it's
     more than my nerves can stand."

==>      Holmes leaned forward and laid his long, thin fingers upon the <==
     woman's shoulder. He had an almost hypnotic power of soothing when he
     wished. The scared look faded from her eyes, and her agitated
     features smoothed into their usual commonplace. She sat down in the
     chair which he had indicated.

     burnt matches and a cigarette-end upon the table.

     "They were on his tray this morning. I brought them because I had
     heard that you can read great things out of small ones."

==>      Holmes shrugged his shoulders. <==

     "There is nothing here," said he. "The matches have, of course, been
     used to light cigarettes. That is obvious from the shortness of the
     burnt end. Half the match is consumed in lighting a pipe or cigar.
     But, dear me! this cigarette stub is certainly remarkable. The

     morning?"

     Our client had suddenly burst into the room with an explosive energy
     which told of some new and momentous development.

==>      "It's a police matter, Mr. Holmes!" she cried. "I'll have no more of <==
     it! He shall pack out of there with his baggage. I would have gone
     straight up and told him so, only I thought it was but fair to you to
     take your opinion first. But I'm at the end of my patience, and when
     it comes to knocking my old man about--"

     never saw what became of the cab. When he picked himself up he found
     he was on Hampstead Heath; so he took a bus home, and there he lies
     now on his sofa, while I came straight round to tell you what had
     happened."

==>      "Most interesting," said Holmes. "Did he observe the appearance of <==
     these men--did he hear them talk?"

     "No; he is clean dazed. He just knows that he was lifted up as if by
     magic and dropped as if by magic. Two a least were in it, and maybe
     three."

     equally clear that his enemies, lying in wait for him near your door,
     mistook your husband for him in the foggy morning light. On
     discovering their mistake they released him. What they would have
     done had it not been a mistake, we can only conjecture."

==>      "Well, what am I to do, Mr. Holmes?" <==

     "I have a great fancy to see this lodger of yours, Mrs. Warren."

     "I don't see how that is to be managed, unless you break in the door.
     I always hear him unlock it as I go down the stair after I leave the

     The landlady thought for a moment.

     "Well, sir, there's the box-room opposite. I could arrange a
     looking-glass, maybe, and if you were behind the door--"

==>      "Excellent!" said Holmes. "When does he lunch?" <==

     "About one, sir."

     "Then Dr. Watson and I will come round in time. For the present, Mrs.
     Warren, good-bye."

[line number in individual story] matching line = 337    window = 332 342

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 60577    window = 60572 60582


     At half-past twelve we found ourselves upon the steps of Mrs.
     Warren's house--a high, thin, yellow-brick edifice in Great Orme
     Street, a narrow thoroughfare at the northeast side of the British
     Museum. Standing as it does near the corner of the street, it
     commands a view down Howe Street, with its ore pretentious houses.
==>      Holmes pointed with a chuckle to one of these, a row of residential <==
     flats, which projected so that they could not fail to catch the eye.

     "See, Watson!" said he. "'High red house with stone facings.' There
     is the signal station all right. We know the place, and we know the
     code; so surely our task should be simple. There's a 'to let' card in

     died away, there was the creak of a turning key, the handle revolved,
     and two thin hands darted out and lifted the tray form the chair. An
     instant later it was hurriedly replaced, and I caught a glimpse of a
     dark, beautiful, horrified face glaring at the narrow opening of the
     box-room. Then the door crashed to, the key turned once more, and all
==>      was silence. Holmes twitched my sleeve, and together we stole down <==
     the stair.

     "I will call again in the evening," said he to the expectant
     landlady. "I think, Watson, we can discuss this business better in
     our own quarters."

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 60647    window = 60642 60652


     "Why should you go further in it? What have you to gain from it?"

     "What, indeed? It is art for art's sake, Watson. I suppose when you
     doctored you found yourself studying cases without thought of a fee?"

==>      "For my education, Holmes." <==

     "Education never ends, Watson. It is a series of lessons with the
     greatest for the last. This is an instructive case. There is neither
     money nor credit in it, and yet one would wish to tidy it up. When
     dusk comes we should find ourselves one stage advanced in our

     colour, broken only by the sharp yellow squares of the windows and
     the blurred haloes of the gas-lamps. As we peered from the darkened
     sitting-room of the lodging-house, one more dim light glimmered high
     up through the obscurity.

==>      "Someone is moving in that room," said Holmes in a whisper, his gaunt <==
     and eager face thrust forward to the window-pane. "Yes, I can see his
     shadow. There he is again! He has a candle in his hand. Now he is
     peering across. He wants to be sure that she is on the lookout. Now
     he begins to flash. Take the message also, Watson, that we may check
     each other. A single flash--that is A, surely. Now, then. How many

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 60679    window = 60674 60684


     very curious. Now he is off once more! AT--why he is repeating it for
     the third time. ATTENTA three times! How often will he repeat it? No,
     that seems to be the finish. He has withdrawn form the window. What
     do you make of it, Watson?"

==>      "A cipher message, Holmes." <==

     My companion gave a sudden chuckle of comprehension. "And not a very
     obscure cipher, Watson," said he. "Why, of course, it is Italian! The
     A means that it is addressed to a woman. 'Beware! Beware! Beware!'
     How's that, Watson?

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 60705    window = 60700 60710



     The light had suddenly gone out, the glimmering square of window had
     disappeared, and the third floor formed a dark band round the lofty
     building, with its tiers of shining casements. That last warning cry
     had been suddenly cut short. How, and by whom? The same thought
==>      occurred on the instant to us both. Holmes sprang up from where he <==
     crouched by the window.

     "This is serious, Watson," he cried. "There is some devilry going
     forward! Why should such a message stop in such a way? I should put
     Scotland Yard in touch with this business--and yet, it is too

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 60727    window = 60722 60732


     out into the night, waiting with breathless suspense for the renewal
     of that interrupted message. At the doorway of the Howe Street flats
     a man, muffled in a cravat and greatcoat, was leaning against the
     railing. He started as the hall-light fell upon our faces.

==>      "Holmes!" he cried. <==

     "Why, Gregson!" said my companion as he shook hands with the Scotland
     Yard detective. "Journeys end with lovers' meetings. What brings you
     here?"


[line number in individual story] matching line = 506    window = 501 511

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 60746    window = 60741 60751


     "Yes, from that window. They broke off in the middle. We came over to
     see the reason. But since it is safe in your hands I see no object in
     continuing this business."

     "Wait a bit!" cried Gregson eagerly. "I'll do you this justice, Mr.
==>      Holmes, that I was never in a case yet that I didn't feel stronger <==
     for having you on my side. There's only the one exit to these flats,
     so we have him safe."

     "Who is he?"


[line number in individual story] matching line = 512    window = 507 517

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 60752    window = 60747 60757


     for having you on my side. There's only the one exit to these flats,
     so we have him safe."

     "Who is he?"

==>      "Well, well, we score over you for once, Mr. Holmes. You must give us <==
     best this time." He struck his stick sharply upon the ground, on
     which a cabman, his whip in his hand, sauntered over from a
     four-wheeler which stood on the far side of the street. "May I
     introduce you to Mr. Sherlock Holmes?" he said to the cabman. "This
     is Mr. Leverton, of Pinkerton's American Agency."

     "The hero of the Long Island cave mystery?" said Holmes. "Sir, I am
     pleased to meet you."

==>      "The hero of the Long Island cave mystery?" said Holmes. "Sir, I am <==
     pleased to meet you."

     The American, a quiet, businesslike young man, with a clean-shaven,
     hatchet face, flushed up at the words of commendation. "I am on the
     trail of my life now, Mr. Holmes," said he. "If I can get Gorgiano--"

     "What! Gorgiano of the Red Circle?"

     "Oh, he has a European fame, has he? Well, we've learned all about
     him in America. We know he is at the bottom of fifty murders, and yet

     some excuse to get my hand on his collar. Mr. Gregson and I ran him
     to ground in that big tenement house, and there's only one door, so
     he can't slip us. There's three folk come out since he went in, but
     I'll swear he wasn't one of them."

==>      "Mr. Holmes talks of signals," said Gregson. "I expect, as usual, he <==
     knows a good deal that we don't."

     In a few clear words Holmes explained the situation as it had
     appeared to us. The American struck his hands together with vexation.

==>      In a few clear words Holmes explained the situation as it had <==

     "He's on to us!" he cried.

     "Why do you think so?"

     Then suddenly, just as by your own account he was telling them that
     there was danger, he broke short off. What could it mean except that
     from the window he had suddenly either caught sight of us in the
     street, or in some way come to understand how close the danger was,
     and that he must act right away if he was to avoid it? What do you
==>      suggest, Mr. Holmes?" <==

     "That we go up at once and see for ourselves."

     "But we have no warrant for his arrest."

     two-edged dagger lay upon the floor, and near it a black kid glove.

     detective. "Someone has got ahead of us this time."

==>      "Here is the candle in the window, Mr. Holmes," said Gregson. "Why, <==
     whatever are you doing?"

     Holmes had stepped across, had lit the candle, and was passing it
     backward and forward across the window-panes. Then he peered into the
     darkness, blew the candle out, and threw it on the floor.

     "That is your man, I fancy. I can give you his description, and we
     have a very excellent outline of his footmark. That should be enough
     for you."

==>      "Not much, Mr. Holmes, among the millions of London." <==

     "Perhaps not. That is why I thought it best to summon this lady to
     your aid."

     We all turned round at the words. There, framed in the doorway, was a

     Gennaro? He called me this moment from this window, and I ran with
     all my speed."

     desirable. I knew that I had only to flash 'Vieni' and you would

     may be as anxious to give us information as we can be to get it. You
     understand, madam, that your husband will be arrested and tried for
     the death of the man who lies before us? What you say may be used in
     evidence. But if you think that he has acted from motives which are
     not criminal, and which he would wish to have known, then you cannot

     "Now that Gorgiano is dead we fear nothing," said the lady. "He was a
     devil and a monster, and there can be no judge in the world who would
     punish my husband for having killed him."

==>      "In that case," said Holmes, "my suggestion is that we lock this <==
     door, leave things as we found them, go with this lady to her room,
     and form our opinion after we have heard what it is that she has to
     say to us."

     guess that in New York this lady's husband will receive a pretty
     general vote of thanks."

     "She will have to come with me and see the chief," Gregson answered. 
     "If what she says is corroborated, I do not think she or her husband
==>      has much to fear.  But what I can't make head or tail of, Mr. Holmes, <==
     is how on earth you got yourself mixed up in the matter."

     "Education, Gregson, education.  Still seeking knowledge at the old
     university.  Well, Watson, you have one more specimen of the tragic
     and grotesque to add to your collection.  By the way, it is not eight

     justice, upon the side of kindliness. The two forces made him lay
     down his gum-brush with a sigh of resignation and push back his
     chair.

     "Well, well, Mrs. Warren, let us hear about it, then.  You don't
==>      object to tobacco, I take it? Thank you, Watson--the matches! You are <==
     uneasy, as I understand, because your new lodger remains in his rooms
     and you cannot see him. Why, bless you, Mrs. Warren, if I were your
     lodger you often would not see me for weeks on end."

     "No doubt, sir; but this is different. It frightens me, Mr. Holmes. I

     "Yes, sir; prints it in pencil. Just the word, nothing more. Here's
     the one I brought to show you--soap. Here's another--match. This is
     one he left the first morning--daily gazette. I leave that paper with
     his breakfast every morning."

==>      "Dear me, Watson," said Homes, staring with great curiosity at the <==
     slips of foolscap which the landlady had handed to him, "this is
     certainly a little unusual. Seclusion I can understand; but why
     print? Printing is a clumsy process. Why not write? What would it
     suggest, Watson?"

     "But why? What can it matter to him that his landlady should have a

     "It opens a pleasing field for intelligent speculation. The words are
     written with a broad-pointed, violet-tinted pencil of a not unusual
     pattern. You will observe that the paper is torn away at the side
     here after the printing was done, so that the 's' of 'soap' is partly

     "Of caution?"

     "Exactly. There was evidently some mark, some thumbprint, something

     "Yes, sir."

     "I don't understand that. I should say that only a clean-shaven man

     have been singed."

     "A holder?" I suggested.

     "No, no; the end is matted. I suppose there could not be two people

     privacy until we have some reason to think that there is a guilty
     reason for it. I've taken up the matter, and I won't lose sight of
     it. Report to me if anything fresh occurs, and rely upon my
     assistance if it should be needed.

==>      "There are certainly some points of interest in this case, Watson," <==
     he remarked when the landlady had left us. "It may, of course, be
     trivial--individual eccentricity; or it may be very much deeper than
     appears on the surface. The first thing that strike one is the
     obvious possibility that the person now in the rooms may be entirely
     different from the one who engaged them."

[line number in individual story] matching line = 214    window = 209 219

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 60454    window = 60449 60459


     the person who went out. Then, again, the man who took the rooms
     spoke English well. This other, however, prints 'match' when it
     should have been 'matches.' I can imagine that the word was taken out
     of a dictionary, which would give the noun but not the plural. The
     laconic style may be to conceal the absence of knowledge of English.
==>      Yes, Watson, there are good reasons to suspect that there has been a <==
     substitution of lodgers."

     "But for what possible end?"

     "Ah! there lies our problem. There is one rather obvious line of

     fortunately we need concern ourselves with the one paper only. Here
     are the Daily Gazette extracts of the last fortnight. 'Lady with a
     black boa at Prince's Skating Club'--that we may pass. 'Surely Jimmy
     will not break his mother's heart'--that appears to be irrelevant.
     'If the lady who fainted on Brixton bus'--she does not interest me.
==>      'Every day my heart longs--' Bleat, Watson--unmitigated bleat! Ah, <==
     this is a little more possible. Listen to this: 'Be patient. Will
     find some sure means of communications. Meanwhile, this column. G.'
     That is two days after Mrs. Warren's lodger arrived. It sounds
     plausible, does it not? The mysterious one could understand English,
     even if he could not print it. Let us see if we can pick up the trace

[line number in individual story] matching line = 247    window = 242 252

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 60487    window = 60482 60492


     Nothing for a week after that. Then comes something much more
     definite: 'The path is clearing. If I find chance signal message
     remember code agreed--One A, two B, and so on. You will hear soon.
     G.' That was in yesterday's paper, and there is nothing in to-day's.
     It's all very appropriate to Mrs. Warren's lodger. If we wait a
==>      little, Watson, I don't doubt that the affair will grow more <==
     intelligible."

     So it proved; for in the morning I found my friend standing on the
     hearthrug with his back to the fire and a smile of complete
     satisfaction upon his face.

     So it proved; for in the morning I found my friend standing on the
     hearthrug with his back to the fire and a smile of complete
     satisfaction upon his face.

==>      "How's this, Watson?" he cried, picking up the paper from the table. <==
     "'High red house with white stone facings. Third floor. Second window
     left. After dusk. G.' That is definite enough. I think after
     breakfast we must make a little reconnaissance of Mrs. Warren's
     neighbourhood. Ah, Mrs. Warren! what news do you bring us this
     morning?"

     "Excellent!" said Holmes. "When does he lunch?"

     "About one, sir."

==>      "Then Dr. Watson and I will come round in time. For the present, Mrs. <==
     Warren, good-bye."

     At half-past twelve we found ourselves upon the steps of Mrs.
     Warren's house--a high, thin, yellow-brick edifice in Great Orme
     Street, a narrow thoroughfare at the northeast side of the British

[line number in individual story] matching line = 340    window = 335 345

     Museum. Standing as it does near the corner of the street, it
     commands a view down Howe Street, with its ore pretentious houses.
     Holmes pointed with a chuckle to one of these, a row of residential
     flats, which projected so that they could not fail to catch the eye.

==>      "See, Watson!" said he. "'High red house with stone facings.' There <==
     is the signal station all right. We know the place, and we know the
     code; so surely our task should be simple. There's a 'to let' card in
     that window. It is evidently an empty flat to which the confederate
     has access. Well, Mrs. Warren, what now?"


[line number in individual story] matching line = 366    window = 361 371

     box-room. Then the door crashed to, the key turned once more, and all
     was silence. Holmes twitched my sleeve, and together we stole down
     the stair.

     "I will call again in the evening," said he to the expectant
==>      landlady. "I think, Watson, we can discuss this business better in <==
     our own quarters."

     "My surmise, as you saw, proved to be correct," said he, speaking
     from the depths of his easy-chair. "There has been a substitution of
     lodgers. What I did not foresee is that we should find a woman, and

     "My surmise, as you saw, proved to be correct," said he, speaking
     from the depths of his easy-chair. "There has been a substitution of
     lodgers. What I did not foresee is that we should find a woman, and
==>      no ordinary woman, Watson." <==

     "She saw us."

     "Well, she saw something to alarm her. That is certain. The general
     sequence of events is pretty clear, is it not? A couple seek refuge

     their enemies to her. Since he cannot communicate with her direct, he
     has recourse to the agony column of a paper. So far all is clear."

     "But what is at the root of it?"

==>      "Ah, yes, Watson--severely practical, as usual! What is at the root <==
     of it all? Mrs. Warren's whimsical problem enlarges somewhat and
     assumes a more sinister aspect as we proceed. This much we can say:
     that it is no ordinary love escapade. You saw the woman's face at the
     sign of danger. We have heard, too, of the attack upon the landlord,
     which was undoubtedly meant for the lodger. These alarms, and the

     sign of danger. We have heard, too, of the attack upon the landlord,
     which was undoubtedly meant for the lodger. These alarms, and the
     desperate need for secrecy, argue that the matter is one of life or
     death. The attack upon Mr. Warren further shows that the enemy,
     whoever they are, are themselves not aware of the substitution of the
==>      female lodger for the male. It is very curious and complex, Watson." <==

     "Why should you go further in it? What have you to gain from it?"

     "What, indeed? It is art for art's sake, Watson. I suppose when you
     doctored you found yourself studying cases without thought of a fee?"

     Again we saw the dim silhouette of a crouching man and the whisk of
     the small flame across the window as the signals were renewed. They
     came more rapidly than before--so rapid that it was hard to follow
     them.

     Yes, by Jove, it's a danger signal. There he goes again! PERI.
     Halloa, what on earth--"

     The light had suddenly gone out, the glimmering square of window had
     disappeared, and the third floor formed a dark band round the lofty

     building, with its tiers of shining casements. That last warning cry
     had been suddenly cut short. How, and by whom? The same thought
     occurred on the instant to us both. Holmes sprang up from where he
     crouched by the window.

==>      "This is serious, Watson," he cried. "There is some devilry going <==
     forward! Why should such a message stop in such a way? I should put
     Scotland Yard in touch with this business--and yet, it is too
     pressing for us to leave."

     "Shall I go for the police?"

     pressing for us to leave."

     "Shall I go for the police?"

     "We must define the situation a little more clearly. It may bear some

     ourselves and see what we can make of it."

     As we walked rapidly down Howe Street I glanced back at the building
     which we had left. There, dimly outlined at the top window, I could
     see the shadow of a head, a woman's head, gazing tensely, rigidly,

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 61079    window = 61074 61084


     "If what she says is corroborated, I do not think she or her husband
     has much to fear.  But what I can't make head or tail of, Mr. Holmes,
     is how on earth you got yourself mixed up in the matter."

     "Education, Gregson, education.  Still seeking knowledge at the old

     and grotesque to add to your collection.  By the way, it is not eight
     o'clock, and a Wagner night at Covent Garden!  If we hurry, we might
     be in time for the second act."
