     Somewhere in the vaults of the bank of Cox and Co., at Charing Cross,
     there is a travel-worn and battered tin dispatch-box with my name,
     John H. Watson, M.D., Late Indian Army, painted upon the lid. It is
     crammed with papers, nearly all of which are records of cases to
==>      illustrate the curious problems which Mr. Sherlock Holmes had at <==
     various times to examine. Some, and not the least interesting, were
     complete failures, and as such will hardly bear narrating, since no
     final explanation is forthcoming. A problem without a solution may
     interest the student, but can hardly fail to annoy the casual reader.
     Among these unfinished tales is that of Mr. James Phillimore, who,

     On the contrary, I found that he had nearly finished his meal, and
     that his mood was particularly bright and joyous, with that somewhat
     sinister cheerfulness which was characteristic of his lighter
     moments.

==>      "You have a case, Holmes?" I remarked. <==

     "The faculty of deduction is certainly contagious, Watson," he
     answered. "It has enabled you to probe my secret. Yes, I have a case.
     After a month of trivialities and stagnation the wheels move once
     more."

     ago. Possibly you have already heard of the tragic end of his wife?"

     "Of course. I remember it now. That is why the name is familiar. But
     I really know nothing of the details."

==>      Holmes waved his hand towards some papers on a chair. "I had no idea <==
     that the case was coming my way or I should have had my extracts
     ready," said he. "The fact is that the problem, though exceedingly
     sensational, appeared to present no difficulty. The interesting
     personality of the accused does not obscure the clearness of the
     evidence. That was the view taken by the coroner's jury and also in

     The letter which he handed to me, written in a bold, masterful hand,
     ran as follows:

     Claridge's Hotel
     October 3rd.
==>      Dear Mr. Sherlock Holmes: <==
     I can't see the best woman God ever made go to her death without
     doing all that is possible to save her. I can't explain things--I
     can't even try to explain them, but I know beyond all doubt that Miss
     Dunbar is innocent. You know the facts--who doesn't? It has been the
     gossip of the country. And never a voice raised for her! It's the

     and all I am are for your use if only you can save her. If ever in
     your life you showed your powers, put them now into this case.
     Yours faithfully,
     J. Neil Gibson.

==>      "There you have it," said Sherlock Holmes, knocking out the ashes of <==
     his after-breakfast pipe and slowly refilling it. "That is the
     gentleman I await. As to the story, you have hardly time to master
     all these papers, so I must give it to you in a nutshell if you are
     to take an intelligent interest in the proceedings. This man is the
     greatest financial power in the world, and a man, as I understand, of

     attractive person. If his wife dies, who more likely to succeed her
     than the young lady who had already by all accounts received pressing
     attentions from her employer? Love, fortune, power, all depending
     upon one middle-aged life. Ugly, Watson--very ugly!"

==>      "Yes, indeed, Holmes." <==

     "Nor could she prove an alibi. On the contrary, she had to admit that
     she was down near Thor Bridge--that was the scene of the
     tragedy--about that hour. She couldn't deny it, for some passing
     villager had seen her there."

     unexpected one. Mr. Marlow Bates was a stranger to both of us. He was
     a thin, nervous wisp of a man with frightened eyes and a twitching,
     hesitating manner--a man whom my own professional eye would judge to
     be on the brink of an absolute nervous breakdown.

==>      "You seem agitated, Mr. Bates," said Holmes. "Pray sit down. I fear I <==
     can only give you a short time, for I have an appointment at eleven."

     "I know you have," our visitor gasped, shooting out short sentences
     like a man who is out of breath. "Mr. Gibson is coming. Mr. Gibson is
     my employer. I am manager of his estate. Mr. Holmes, he is a

     villain--an infernal villain."

     "Strong language, Mr. Bates."

==>      "I have to be emphatic, Mr. Holmes, for the time is so limited. I <==
     would not have him find me here for the world. He is almost due now.
     But I was so situated that I could not come earlier. His secretary,
     Mr. Ferguson, only told me this morning of his appointment with you."

     "And you are his manager?"

     Mr. Ferguson, only told me this morning of his appointment with you."

     "And you are his manager?"

     "I have given him notice. In a couple of weeks I shall have shaken
==>      off his accursed slavery. A hard man, Mr. Holmes, hard to all about <==
     him. Those public charities are a screen to cover his private
     iniquities. But his wife was his chief victim. He was brutal to
     her--yes, sir, brutal! How she came by her death I do not know, but I
     am sure that he had made her life a misery to her. She was a creature
     of the tropics, a Brazilian by birth, as no doubt you know."

     almost due."

     With a frightened look at the clock our strange visitor literally ran
     to the door and disappeared.

==>      "Well! Well!" said Holmes after an interval of silence. "Mr. Gibson <==
     seems to have a nice loyal household. But the warning is a useful
     one, and now we can only wait till the man himself appears."

     Sharp at the hour we heard a heavy step upon the stairs, and the
     famous millionaire was shown into the room. As I looked upon him I

     suggestion of hunger and rapacity. An Abraham Lincoln keyed to base
     uses instead of high ones would give some idea of the man. His face
     might have been chiselled in granite, hard-set, craggy, remorseless,
     with deep lines upon it, the scars of many a crisis. Cold gray eyes,
     looking shrewdly out from under bristling brows, surveyed us each in
==>      turn. He bowed in perfunctory fashion as Holmes mentioned my name, <==
     and then with a masterful air of possession he drew a chair up to my
     companion and seated himself with his bony knees almost touching him.

     "Let me say right here, Mr. Holmes," he began, "that money is nothing
     to me in this case. You can burn it if it's any use in lighting you

     If you pull this off every paper in England and America will be

     The Gold King gave a violent start and half rose from his chair. Then
     his massive calm came back to him.

     "I suppose you are within your rights--and maybe doing your duty--in
==>      asking such a question, Mr. Holmes." <==

     "We will agree to suppose so," said Holmes.

     "Then I can assure you that our relations were entirely and always

     "I am a rather busy man, Mr. Gibson," said he, "and I have no time or
     taste for aimless conversations. I wish you good-morning."

     Our visitor had risen also, and his great loose figure towered above

     Our visitor had risen also, and his great loose figure towered above

     a tinge of colour in the sallow cheeks.

     "What the devil do you mean by this, Mr. Holmes? Do you dismiss my
     case?"

     "Well, Mr. Gibson, at least I dismiss you. I should have thought my
     words were plain."

     words were plain."

     "Plain enough, but what's at the back of it? Raising the price on me,
     or afraid to tackle it, or what? I've a right to a plain answer."

==>      "Well, perhaps you have," said Holmes. "I'll give you one. This case <==
     is quite sufficiently complicated to start with without the further
     difficulty of false information."

     "Meaning that I lie."

     "Well, I was trying to express it as delicately as I could, but if
     you insist upon the word I will not contradict you."

     I sprang to my feet, for the expression upon the millionaire's face
     was fiendish in its intensity, and he had raised his great knotted
==>      fist. Holmes smiled languidly and reached his hand out for his pipe. <==

     "Don't be noisy, Mr. Gibson. I find that after breakfast even the
     smallest argument is unsettling. I suggest that a stroll in the
     morning air and a little quiet thought will be greatly to your
     advantage."

     admire him, for by a supreme self-command he had turned in a minute
     from a hot flame of anger to a frigid and contemptuous indifference.

     "Well, it's your choice. I guess you know how to run your own
     business. I can't make you touch the case against your will. You've

     stronger men than you. No man ever crossed me and was the better for
     it."

     "So many have said so, and yet here I am," said Holmes, smiling.

     who would certainly brush any obstacle from his path, and when I
     remember that his wife may have been an obstacle and an object of
     dislike, as that man Bates plainly told us, it seems to me--"

     The Gold King had reentered the room in a more chastened mood than he
     had left it. His wounded pride still showed in his resentful eyes,
     but his common sense had shown him that he must yield if he would
     attain his end.

==>      "I've been thinking it over, Mr. Holmes, and I feel that I have been <==
     hasty in taking your remarks amiss. You are justified in getting down
     to the facts, whatever they may be, and I think the more of you for
     it. I can assure you, however, that the relations between Miss Dunbar
     and me don't really touch this case."

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 71343    window = 71338 71348



     "Exactly. That expresses it. And it is only a patient who has an
     object in deceiving his surgeon who would conceal the facts of his
     case."

==>      "That may be so, but you will admit, Mr. Holmes, that most men would <==
     shy off a bit when they are asked point-blank what their relations
     with a woman may be--if there is really some serious feeling in the
     case. I guess most men have a little private reserve of their own in
     some corner of their souls where they don't welcome intruders. And
     you burst suddenly into it. But the object excuses you, since it was

     "The truth."

     The Gold King paused for a moment as one who marshals his thoughts.
     His grim, deep-lined face had become even sadder and more grave.

==>      "I can give it to you in a very few words, Mr. Holmes," said he at <==
     last. "There are some things that are painful as well as difficult to
     say, so I won't go deeper than is needful. I met my wife when I was
     gold-hunting in Brazil. Maria Pinto was the daughter of a government
     official at Manaos, and she was very beautiful. I was young and
     ardent in those days, but even now, as I look back with colder blood

     portrait in the papers. The whole world has proclaimed that she also
     is a very beautiful woman. Now, I make no pretence to be more moral
     than my neighbours, and I will admit to you that I could not live
     under the same roof with such a woman and in daily contact with her
     without feeling a passionate regard for her. Do you blame me, Mr.

     "I do not blame you for feeling it. I should blame you if you
     expressed it, since this young lady was in a sense under your
     protection."

     wanted anything more than the love and possession of that woman. I
     told her so."

     "Oh, you did, did you?"

==>      Holmes could look very formidable when he was moved. <==

     "I said to her that if I could marry her I would, but that it was out
     of my power. I said that money was no object and that all I could do
     to make her happy and comfortable would be done."

     "See here, Mr. Holmes. I came to you on a question of evidence, not
     on a question of morals. I'm not asking for your criticism."

     really worse than what you have yourself admitted, that you have
     tried to ruin a defenceless girl who was under your roof. Some of you

     "How?"

     "Well, she knew something of my affairs. They are large, Mr.

     break--and it is usually break. It wasn't individuals only. It was
     communities, cities, even nations. Business is a hard game, and the
     weak go to the wall. I played the game for all it was worth. I never
     squealed myself, and I never cared if the other fellow squealed. But
     she saw it different. I guess she was right. She believed and said

     "It's very black against her. I can't deny that. And women lead an
     inward life and may do things beyond the judgment of a man. At first
     I was so rattled and taken aback that I was ready to think she had
     been led away in some extraordinary fashion that was clean against
     her usual nature. One explanation came into my head. I give it to
==>      you, Mr. Holmes, for what it is worth. There is no doubt that my wife <==
     was bitterly jealous. There is a soul-jealousy that can be as frantic
     as any body-jealousy, and though my wife had no cause--and I think
     she understood this--for the latter, she was aware that this English
     girl exerted an influence upon my mind and my acts that she herself
     never had. It was an influence for good, but that did not mend the

     always in her blood. She might have planned to murder Miss Dunbar--or
     we will say to threaten her with a gun and so frighten her into
     leaving us. Then there might have been a scuffle and the gun gone off
     and shot the woman who held it."

==>      "That possibility had already occurred to me," said Holmes. "Indeed, <==
     it is the only obvious alternative to deliberate murder."

     "But she utterly denies it."

     "Well, that is not final--is it? One can understand that a woman

     "Miss Dunbar herself."

     "Well, perhaps."

==>      Holmes looked at his watch. "I have no doubt we can get the necessary <==
     permits this morning and reach Winchester by the evening train. When
     I have seen this young lady it is very possible that I may be of more
     use to you in the matter, though I cannot promise that my conclusions
     will necessarily be such as you desire."

     come upon something of vital importance, though the information was
     usually commonplace enough. Behind these tricks of manner he soon
     showed himself to be a decent, honest fellow who was not too proud to
     admit that he was out of his depth and would welcome any help.

==>      "Anyhow, I'd rather have you than Scotland Yard, Mr. Holmes," said <==
     he. "If the Yard gets called into a case, then the local loses all
     credit for success and may be blamed for failure. Now, you play
     straight, so I've heard."

     "I need not appear in the matter at all," said Holmes to the evident

     relief of our melancholy acquaintance. "If I can clear it up I don't
     ask to have my name mentioned."

     "Well, it's very handsome of you, I am sure. And your friend, Dr.

     the place there is one question I should like to ask you. I'd breathe
     it to no soul but you." He looked round as though he hardly dare
     utter the words. "Don't you think there might be a case against Mr.
     Neil Gibson himself?"

     letter is very obscure, is it not?"

     "Well, sir," said the guide, "it seemed, if I may be so bold as to
     say so, the only really clear point in the whole case."

==>      Holmes shook his head. <==

     "Granting that the letter is genuine and was really written, it was
     certainly received some time before--say one hour or two. Why, then,
     was this lady still clasping it in her left hand? Why should she
     carry it so carefully? She did not need to refer to it in the

     The stonework was gray, but at this one point it showed white for a
     space not larger than a sixpence. When examined closely one could see
     that the surface was chipped as by a sharp blow.

==>      "It took some violence to do that," said Holmes thoughtfully. With <==
     his cane he struck the ledge several times without leaving a mark.
     "Yes, it was a hard knock. In a curious place, too. It was not from
     above but from below, for you see that it is on the lower edge of the
     parapet."

     "No, I cannot say that. But I have heard words which were nearly as
     bad--words of cold, cutting contempt, even before the servants."

     "Our millionaire does not seem to shine in private life," remarked
==>      Holmes as we made our way to the station. "Well, Watson, we have come <==
     on a good many facts, some of them new ones, and yet I seem some way
     from my conclusion. In spite of the very evident dislike which Mr.
     Bates has to his employer, I gather from him that when the alarm came
     he was undoubtedly in his library. Dinner was over at 8.30 and all
     was normal up to then. It is true that the alarm was somewhat late in

     have several very vital questions to ask that young lady, and my mind
     will not be easy until we have seen her. I must confess that the case
     would seem to me to be very black against her if it were not for one
     thing."

==>      "And what is that, Holmes?" <==

     "The finding of the pistol in her wardrobe."

     "Dear me, Holmes!" I cried, "that seemed to me to be the most damning
     incident of all."

     us.

     "Perhaps Mr. Neil Gibson has told you something of what occurred
     between us?" she asked in a low, agitated voice.

==>      "Yes," Holmes answered, "you need not pain yourself by entering into <==
     that part of the story. After seeing you, I am prepared to accept Mr.
     Gibson's statement both as to the influence which you had over him
     and as to the innocence of your relations with him. But why was the
     whole situation not brought out in court?"

     thought that if we waited the whole thing must clear itself up
     without our being compelled to enter into painful details of the
     inner life of the family. But I understand that far from clearing it
     has become even more serious."

==>      "My dear young lady," cried Holmes earnestly, "I beg you to have no <==
     illusions upon the point. Mr. Cummings here would assure you that all
     the cards are at present against us, and that we must do everything
     that is possible if we are to win clear. It would be a cruel
     deception to pretend that you are not in very great danger. Give me
     all the help you can, then, to get at the truth."

     tropical nature. She was a woman who would do nothing by halves, and
     the measure of her love for her husband was the measure also of her
     hatred for me. It is probable that she misunderstood our relations. I
     would not wish to wrong her, but she loved so vividly in a physical
     sense that she could hardly understand the mental, and even

     under his roof. I can see now that I was wrong. Nothing could justify
     me in remaining where I was a cause of unhappiness, and yet it is
     certain that the unhappiness would have remained even if I had left
     the house."

==>      "Now, Miss Dunbar," said Holmes, "I beg you to tell us exactly what <==
     occurred that evening."

     "I can tell you the truth so far as I know it, Mr. Holmes, but I am
     in a position to prove nothing, and there are points--the most vital

     "Within a few yards from the spot."

     "And yet, presuming that she met her death shortly after you left
     her, you heard no shot?"

==>      "No, I heard nothing. But, indeed, Mr. Holmes, I was so agitated and <==
     horrified by this terrible outbreak that I rushed to get back to the
     peace of my own room, and I was incapable of noticing anything which
     happened."

     time of the tragedy, and why at the very place?"

     "But what could have caused it? Only great violence could have such
     an effect."

==>      Holmes did not answer. His pale, eager face had suddenly assumed that <==
     tense, far-away expression which I had learned to associate with the
     supreme manifestations of his genius. So evident was the crisis in
     his mind that none of us dared to speak, and we sat, barrister,
     prisoner, and myself, watching him in a concentrated and absorbed
     silence. Suddenly he sprang from his chair, vibrating with nervous

     silence. Suddenly he sprang from his chair, vibrating with nervous
     energy and the pressing need for action.

     "Come, Watson, come!" he cried.

==>      "What is it, Mr. Holmes?" <==

     "Never mind, my dear lady. You will hear from me, Mr. Cummings. With
     the help of the god of justice I will give you a case which will make
     England ring. You will get news by to-morrow, Miss Dunbar, and
     meanwhile take my assurance that the clouds are lifting and that I

     England ring. You will get news by to-morrow, Miss Dunbar, and
     meanwhile take my assurance that the clouds are lifting and that I
     have every hope that the light of truth is breaking through."

     It was not a long journey from Winchester to Thor Place, but it was
==>      long to me in my impatience, while for Holmes it was evident that it <==
     seemed endless; for, in his nervous restlessness, he could not sit
     still, but paced the carriage or drummed with his long, sensitive
     fingers upon the cushions beside him. Suddenly, however, as we neared
     our destination he seated himself opposite to me--we had a
     first-class carriage to ourselves--and laying a hand upon each of my

     "Do you know, Watson," said he, "I believe your revolver is going to
     have a very intimate connection with the mystery which we are
     investigating."

==>      "My dear Holmes, you are joking." <==

     "No, Watson, I am very serious. There is a test before us. If the
     test comes off, all will be clear. And the test will depend upon the
     conduct of this little weapon. One cartridge out. Now we will replace
     the other five and put on the safety-catch. So! That increases the

     I had no glimmer of what was in his mind, nor did he enlighten me,
     but sat lost in thought until we pulled up in the little Hampshire
     station. We secured a ramshackle trap, and in a quarter of an hour
     were at the house of our confidential friend, the sergeant.

==>      "A clue, Mr. Holmes? What is it?" <==

     "It all depends upon the behaviour of Dr. Watson's revolver," said my
     friend. "Here it is. Now, officer, can you give me ten yards of
     string?"

     friend. "Here it is. Now, officer, can you give me ten yards of
     string?"

     The village shop provided a ball of stout twine.

==>      "I think that this is all we will need," said Holmes. "Now, if you <==
     please, we will get off on what I hope is the last stage of our
     journey."

     The sun was setting and turning the rolling Hampshire moor into a
     wonderful autumnal panorama. The sergeant, with many critical and

     At the words he raised the pistol to his head, and then let go his
     grip. In an instant it had been whisked away by the weight of the
     stone, had struck with a sharp crack against the parapet, and had
     vanished over the side into the water. It had hardly gone before
==>      Holmes was kneeling beside the stonework, and a joyous cry showed <==
     that he had found what he expected.

     "Was there ever a more exact demonstration?" he cried. "See, Watson,
     your revolver has solved the problem!" As he spoke he pointed to a
     second chip of the exact size and shape of the first which had

     murder upon an innocent victim. You can let Mr. Gibson know that I
     will see him in the morning, when steps can be taken for Miss
     Dunbar's vindication."

     Late that evening, as we sat together smoking our pipes in the
==>      village inn, Holmes gave me a brief review of what had passed. <==

     "I fear, Watson," said he, "that you will not improve any reputation
     which I may have acquired by adding the case of the Thor Bridge
     mystery to your annals. I have been sluggish in mind and wanting in
     that mixture of imagination and reality which is the basis of my art.

     crammed with papers, nearly all of which are records of cases to
     illustrate the curious problems which Mr. Sherlock Holmes had at
     various times to examine. Some, and not the least interesting, were
     complete failures, and as such will hardly bear narrating, since no
     final explanation is forthcoming. A problem without a solution may

     sinister cheerfulness which was characteristic of his lighter
     moments.

     "You have a case, Holmes?" I remarked.

     answered. "It has enabled you to probe my secret. Yes, I have a case.
     After a month of trivialities and stagnation the wheels move once
     more."

     "Might I share it?"

     sensational, appeared to present no difficulty. The interesting
     personality of the accused does not obscure the clearness of the
     evidence. That was the view taken by the coroner's jury and also in
     the police-court proceedings. It is now referred to the Assizes at
     Winchester. I fear it is a thankless business. I can discover facts,

     unexpected ones come to light I do not see what my client can hope
     for."

     "Your client?"

     "Your client?"

     "Ah, I forgot I had not told you. I am getting into your involved

     first."

     The letter which he handed to me, written in a bold, masterful hand,
     ran as follows:

     centre of a historical English state. Then as to the tragedy. The
     wife was found in the grounds nearly half a mile from the house, late
     at night, clad in her dinner dress, with a shawl over her shoulders
     and a revolver bullet through her brain. No weapon was found near her
     and there was no local clue as to the murder. No weapon near her,
==>      Watson--mark that! The crime seems to have been committed late in the <==
     evening, and the body was found by a game-keeper about eleven
     o'clock, when it was examined by the police and by a doctor before
     being carried up to the house. Is this too condensed, or can you
     follow it clearly?"

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 71111    window = 71106 71116


     with the bullet was found on the floor of her wardrobe." His eyes
     fixed and he repeated in broken words,
     "On--the--floor--of--her--wardrobe." Then he sank into silence, and I
     saw that some train of thought had been set moving which I should be
     foolish to interrupt. Suddenly with a start he emerged into brisk
==>      life once more. "Yes, Watson, it was found. Pretty damning, eh? So <==
     the two juries thought. Then the dead woman had a note upon her
     making an appointment at that very place and signed by the governess.
     How's that? Finally there is the motive. Senator Gibson is an
     attractive person. If his wife dies, who more likely to succeed her
     than the young lady who had already by all accounts received pressing

==>      upon one middle-aged life. Ugly, Watson--very ugly!" <==

     "Yes, indeed, Holmes."

     "Nor could she prove an alibi. On the contrary, she had to admit that
     she was down near Thor Bridge--that was the scene of the

     tragedy--about that hour. She couldn't deny it, for some passing
     villager had seen her there."

     "That really seems final."

     a long, deep, reed-girt sheet of water. Thor Mere it is called. In
     the mouth of the bridge lay the dead woman. Such are the main facts.
     But here, if I mistake not, is our client, considerably before his
     time."

     "Well, good-morning, Mr. Gibson. You have a good deal yet to learn."

     Our visitor made a noisy exit, but Holmes smoked in imperturbable
     silence with dreamy eyes fixed upon the ceiling.

==>      "Any views, Watson?" he asked at last. <==

     "Well, Holmes, I must confess that when I consider that this is a man
     who would certainly brush any obstacle from his path, and when I
     remember that his wife may have been an obstacle and an object of
     dislike, as that man Bates plainly told us, it seems to me--"

     "Exactly. And to me also."

     "But what were his relations with the governess, and how did you
     discover them?"

==>      "Bluff, Watson, bluff! When I considered the passionate, <==
     unconventional, unbusinesslike tone of his letter and contrasted it
     with his self-contained manner and appearance, it was pretty clear
     that there was some deep emotion which centred upon the accused woman
     rather than upon the victim. We've got to understand the exact
     relations of those three people if we are to reach the truth. You saw

     "Perhaps he will come back?"

     "He is sure to come back. He must come back. He can't leave it where
     it is. Ha! isn't that a ring? Yes, there is his footstep. Well, Mr.
==>      Gibson, I was just saying to Dr. Watson that you were somewhat <==
     overdue."

     The Gold King had reentered the room in a more chastened mood than he
     had left it. His wounded pride still showed in his resentful eyes,
     but his common sense had shown him that he must yield if he would

     "I need not appear in the matter at all," said Holmes to the evident
     relief of our melancholy acquaintance. "If I can clear it up I don't
     ask to have my name mentioned."

     "Well, it's very handsome of you, I am sure. And your friend, Dr.
==>      Watson, can be trusted, I know. Now, Mr. Holmes, as we walk down to <==
     the place there is one question I should like to ask you. I'd breathe
     it to no soul but you." He looked round as though he hardly dare
     utter the words. "Don't you think there might be a case against Mr.
     Neil Gibson himself?"

     "No, I cannot say that. But I have heard words which were nearly as
     bad--words of cold, cutting contempt, even before the servants."

     "Our millionaire does not seem to shine in private life," remarked
==>      Holmes as we made our way to the station. "Well, Watson, we have come <==
     on a good many facts, some of them new ones, and yet I seem some way
     from my conclusion. In spite of the very evident dislike which Mr.
     Bates has to his employer, I gather from him that when the alarm came
     he was undoubtedly in his library. Dinner was over at 8.30 and all
     was normal up to then. It is true that the alarm was somewhat late in

     "The finding of the pistol in her wardrobe."

     "Dear me, Holmes!" I cried, "that seemed to me to be the most damning
     incident of all."

==>      "Not so, Watson. It had struck me even at my first perfunctory <==
     reading as very strange, and now that I am in closer touch with the
     case it is my only firm ground for hope. We must look for
     consistency. Where there is a want of it we must suspect deception."

     "I hardly follow you."

     case it is my only firm ground for hope. We must look for

     "I hardly follow you."

     character of a woman who, in a cold, premeditated fashion, is about
     to get rid of a rival. You have planned it. A note has been written.
     The victim has come. You have your weapon. The crime is done. It has
     been workmanlike and complete. Do you tell me that after carrying out
     so crafty a crime you would now ruin your reputation as a criminal by

     so crafty a crime you would now ruin your reputation as a criminal by
     forgetting to fling your weapon into those adjacent reed-beds which
     would forever cover it, but you must needs carry it carefully home
     and put it in your own wardrobe, the very first place that would be

     "In the excitement of the moment--"

     is coolly premeditated, then the means of covering it are coolly
     premeditated also. I hope, therefore, that we are in the presence of
     a serious misconception."

     "But there is so much to explain."

     his mind that none of us dared to speak, and we sat, barrister,
     prisoner, and myself, watching him in a concentrated and absorbed
     silence. Suddenly he sprang from his chair, vibrating with nervous
     energy and the pressing need for action.

==>      "Come, Watson, come!" he cried. <==

     "What is it, Mr. Holmes?"

     "Never mind, my dear lady. You will hear from me, Mr. Cummings. With
     the help of the god of justice I will give you a case which will make

     our destination he seated himself opposite to me--we had a
     first-class carriage to ourselves--and laying a hand upon each of my
     knees he looked into my eyes with the peculiarly mischievous gaze
     which was characteristic of his more imp-like moods.

==>      "Watson," said he, "I have some recollection that you go armed upon <==
     these excursions of ours."

     It was as well for him that I did so, for he took little care for his
     own safety when his mind was once absorbed by a problem, so that more
     than once my revolver had been a good friend in need. I reminded him

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 71971    window = 71966 71976



     "Yes, it is a solid bit of work."

     He mused over it for a minute.

==>      "Do you know, Watson," said he, "I believe your revolver is going to <==
     have a very intimate connection with the mystery which we are
     investigating."

     "My dear Holmes, you are joking."

     have a very intimate connection with the mystery which we are
     investigating."

     "My dear Holmes, you are joking."

==>      "No, Watson, I am very serious. There is a test before us. If the <==
     test comes off, all will be clear. And the test will depend upon the
     conduct of this little weapon. One cartridge out. Now we will replace
     the other five and put on the safety-catch. So! That increases the
     weight and makes it a better reproduction."

     station. We secured a ramshackle trap, and in a quarter of an hour
     were at the house of our confidential friend, the sergeant.

     "A clue, Mr. Holmes? What is it?"

==>      "It all depends upon the behaviour of Dr. Watson's revolver," said my <==
     friend. "Here it is. Now, officer, can you give me ten yards of
     string?"

     The village shop provided a ball of stout twine.

     companion, lurched along beside us. As we approached the scene of the
     crime I could see that my friend under all his habitual coolness was
     in truth deeply agitated.

     "Yes," he said in answer to my remark, "you have seen me miss my mark
==>      before, Watson. I have an instinct for such things, and yet it has <==
     sometimes played me false. It seemed a certainty when first it
     flashed across my mind in the cell at Winchester, but one drawback of
     an active mind is that one can always conceive alternative
     explanations which would make our scent a false one. And yet--and
     yet-- Well, Watson, we can but try."

[line number in individual story] matching line = 1051    window = 1046 1056

     As he walked he had firmly tied one end of the string to the handle
     of the revolver. We had now reached the scene of the tragedy. With
     great care he marked out under the guidance of the policeman the
     exact spot where the body had been stretched. He then hunted among

     stone, had struck with a sharp crack against the parapet, and had
     vanished over the side into the water. It had hardly gone before
     Holmes was kneeling beside the stonework, and a joyous cry showed
     that he had found what he expected.

==>      "Was there ever a more exact demonstration?" he cried. "See, Watson, <==
     your revolver has solved the problem!" As he spoke he pointed to a
     second chip of the exact size and shape of the first which had
     appeared on the under edge of the stone balustrade.

     "We'll stay at the inn to-night," he continued as he rose and faced

     Dunbar's vindication."

     Late that evening, as we sat together smoking our pipes in the
     village inn, Holmes gave me a brief review of what had passed.

==>      "I fear, Watson," said he, "that you will not improve any reputation <==
     which I may have acquired by adding the case of the Thor Bridge
     mystery to your annals. I have been sluggish in mind and wanting in
     that mixture of imagination and reality which is the basis of my art.
     I confess that the chip in the stonework was a sufficient clue to
     suggest the true solution, and that I blame myself for not having

     carried out her terrible purpose. Every link is now in its place and
     the chain is complete. The papers may ask why the mere was not
     dragged in the first instance, but it is easy to be wise after the
     event, and in any case the expanse of a reed-filled lake is no easy
     matter to drag unless you have a clear perception of what you are
==>      looking for and where. Well, Watson, we have helped a remarkable <==
     woman, and also a formidable man. Should they in the future join
     their forces, as seems not unlikely, the financial world may find
     that Mr. Neil Gibson has learned something in that schoolroom of
     sorrow where our earthly lessons are taught."
