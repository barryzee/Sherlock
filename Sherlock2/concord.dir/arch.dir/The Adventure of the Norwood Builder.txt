     "From the point of view of the criminal expert," said Mr. Sherlock
==>      Holmes, "London has become a singularly uninteresting city since the <==
     death of the late lamented Professor Moriarty."

     "I can hardly think that you would find many decent citizens to agree
     with you," I answered.

     criminal world no capital in Europe offered the advantages which
     London then possessed. But now--" He shrugged his shoulders in
     humorous deprecation of the state of things which he had himself done
     so much to produce.

==>      At the time of which I speak Holmes had been back for some months, <==
     and I, at his request, had sold my practice and returned to share the
     old quarters in Baker Street. A young doctor, named Verner, had
     purchased my small Kensington practice, and given with astonishingly
     little demur the highest price that I ventured to ask--an incident
     which only explained itself some years later when I found that Verner

     really found the money.

     Our months of partnership had not been so uneventful as he had
     stated, for I find, on looking over my notes, that this period
     includes the case of the papers of Ex-President Murillo, and also the

     however, to anything in the shape of public applause, and he bound me
     in the most stringent terms to say no further word of himself, his
     methods, or his successes--a prohibition which, as I have explained,
     has only now been removed.

==>      Mr. Sherlock Holmes was leaning back in his chair after his whimsical <==
     protest, and was unfolding his morning paper in a leisurely fashion,
     when our attention was arrested by a tremendous ring at the bell,
     followed immediately by a hollow drumming sound, as if someone were
     beating on the outer door with his fist. As it opened there came a
     tumultuous rush into the hall, rapid feet clattered up the stair, and

     an instant later a wild-eyed and frantic young man, pale,
     dishevelled, and palpitating, burst into the room. He looked from one
     to the other of us, and under our gaze of inquiry he became conscious
     that some apology was needed for this unceremonious entry.

==>      "I'm sorry, Mr. Holmes," he cried. "You mustn't blame me. I am nearly <==
     mad. Mr. Holmes, I am the unhappy John Hector McFarlane."

     He made the announcement as if the name alone would explain both his
     visit and its manner; but I could see by my companion's unresponsive
     face that it meant no more to him than to me.

     Familiar as I was with my friend's methods, it was not difficult for
     me to follow his deductions, and to observe the untidiness of attire,
     the sheaf of legal papers, the watch-charm, and the breathing which
     had prompted them. Our client, however, stared in amazement.

==>      "Yes, I am all that, Mr. Holmes, and in addition I am the most <==
     unfortunate man at this moment in London. For Heaven's sake don't
     abandon me, Mr. Holmes! If they come to arrest me before I have
     finished my story, make them give me time so that I may tell you the
     whole truth. I could go to jail happy if I knew that you were working
     for me outside."

     "Upon the charge of murdering Mr. Jonas Oldacre, of Lower Norwood."

     "Dear me," said he; "it was only this moment at breakfast that I was
     saying to my friend, Dr. Watson, that sensational cases had
     disappeared out of our papers."

     Our visitor stretched forward a quivering hand and picked up the
==>      Daily Telegraph, which still lay upon Holmes's knee. <==

     "If you had looked at it, sir, you would have seen at a glance what
     the errand is on which I have come to you this morning. I feel as if
     my name and my misfortune must be in every man's mouth." He turned it
     over to expose the central page. "Here it is, and with your

     a Well-known Builder. Suspicion of Murder and Arson. A Clue to the

     heart--it will break her heart!" He wrung his hands in an agony of
     apprehension, and swayed backwards and forwards in his chair.

     clean-shaven face, with a weak, sensitive mouth. His age may have
     been about twenty-seven; his dress and bearing that of a gentleman.
     From the pocket of his light summer overcoat protruded the bundle of
     endorsed papers which proclaimed his profession.

==>      "We must use what time we have," said Holmes. "Watson, would you have <==
     the kindness to take the paper and to read me the paragraph in
     question?"

     Underneath the vigorous head-lines which our client had quoted I read
     the following suggestive narrative:--

[line number in individual story] matching line = 178    window = 173 183

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 32476    window = 32471 32481


     ignited so as to hide all traces of the crime. The conduct of the
     criminal investigation has been left in the experienced hands of
     Inspector Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, who is following up the clues
     with his accustomed energy and sagacity."

==>      Sherlock Holmes listened with closed eyes and finger-tips together to <==
     this remarkable account.

     "The case has certainly some points of interest," said he, in his
     languid fashion. "May I ask, in the first place, Mr. McFarlane, how
     it is that you are still at liberty, since there appears to be enough

     "The case has certainly some points of interest," said he, in his
     languid fashion. "May I ask, in the first place, Mr. McFarlane, how
     it is that you are still at liberty, since there appears to be enough
     evidence to justify your arrest?"

==>      "I live at Torrington Lodge, Blackheath, with my parents, Mr. Holmes; <==
     but last night, having to do business very late with Mr. Jonas
     Oldacre, I stayed at an hotel in Norwood, and came to my business
     from there. I knew nothing of this affair until I was in the train,
     when I read what you have just heard. I at once saw the horrible
     danger of my position, and I hurried to put the case into your hands.

[line number in individual story] matching line = 211    window = 206 216

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 32509    window = 32504 32514


     Norwood."

     McFarlane turned to us with a gesture of despair, and sank into his
     chair once more like one who is crushed.

==>      "One moment, Lestrade," said Holmes. "Half an hour more or less can <==
     make no difference to you, and the gentleman was about to give us an
     account of this very interesting affair, which might aid us in
     clearing it up."

     "I think there will be no difficulty in clearing it up," said

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 32520    window = 32515 32525


     Lestrade, grimly.

     "None the less, with your permission, I should be much interested to
     hear his account."

==>      "Well, Mr. Holmes, it is difficult for me to refuse you anything, for <==
     you have been of use to the force once or twice in the past, and we
     owe you a good turn at Scotland Yard," said Lestrade. "At the same
     time I must remain with my prisoner, and I am bound to warn him that
     anything he may say will appear in evidence against him."

     my boy, not one word to your parents about the affair until
     everything is settled. We will keep it as a little surprise for
     them.' He was very insistent upon this point, and made me promise it
     faithfully.

==>      "You can imagine, Mr. Holmes, that I was not in a humour to refuse <==
     him anything that he might ask. He was my benefactor, and all my
     desire was to carry out his wishes in every particular. I sent a
     telegram home, therefore, to say that I had important business on
     hand, and that it was impossible for me to say how late I might be.
     Mr. Oldacre had told me that he would like me to have supper with him

[line number in individual story] matching line = 278    window = 273 283

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 32576    window = 32571 32581


     Mr. Oldacre had told me that he would like me to have supper with him
     at nine, as he might not be home before that hour. I had some
     difficulty in finding his house, however, and it was nearly half-past
     before I reached it. I found him--"

==>      "One moment!" said Holmes. "Who opened the door?" <==

     "A middle-aged woman, who was, I suppose, his housekeeper."

     "And it was she, I presume, who mentioned your name?"


[line number in individual story] matching line = 298    window = 293 303

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 32596    window = 32591 32601


     of documents, which we went over together. It was between eleven and
     twelve when we finished. He remarked that we must not disturb the
     housekeeper. He showed me out through his own French window, which
     had been open all this time."

==>      "Was the blind down?" asked Holmes. <==

     "I will not be sure, but I believe that it was only half down. Yes, I
     remember how he pulled it up in order to swing open the window. I
     could not find my stick, and he said, 'Never mind, my boy; I shall
     see a good deal of you now, I hope, and I will keep your stick until

     papers made up in packets upon the table. It was so late that I could
     not get back to Blackheath, so I spent the night at the Anerley Arms,
     and I knew nothing more until I read of this horrible affair in the
     morning."

==>      "Anything more that you would like to ask, Mr. Holmes?" said <==
     Lestrade, whose eyebrows had gone up once or twice during this
     remarkable explanation.

     "Not until I have been to Blackheath."


[line number in individual story] matching line = 318    window = 313 323

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 32616    window = 32611 32621



     "Not until I have been to Blackheath."

     "You mean to Norwood," said Lestrade.

==>      "Oh, yes; no doubt that is what I must have meant," said Holmes, with <==
     his enigmatical smile. Lestrade had learned by more experiences than
     he would care to acknowledge that that razor-like brain could cut
     through that which was impenetrable to him. I saw him look curiously
     at my companion.

     he would care to acknowledge that that razor-like brain could cut
     through that which was impenetrable to him. I saw him look curiously
     at my companion.

     "I think I should like to have a word with you presently, Mr.
==>      Sherlock Holmes," said he. "Now, Mr. McFarlane, two of my constables <==
     are at the door and there is a four-wheeler waiting." The wretched
     young man arose, and with a last beseeching glance at us walked from
     the room. The officers conducted him to the cab, but Lestrade
     remained.


[line number in individual story] matching line = 331    window = 326 336

     are at the door and there is a four-wheeler waiting." The wretched
     young man arose, and with a last beseeching glance at us walked from
     the room. The officers conducted him to the cab, but Lestrade
     remained.

==>      Holmes had picked up the pages which formed the rough draft of the <==
     will, and was looking at them with the keenest interest upon his
     face.

     "There are some points about that document, Lestrade, are there not?"
     said he, pushing them over.

[line number in individual story] matching line = 345    window = 340 350

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 32643    window = 32638 32648


     "I can read the first few lines, and these in the middle of the
     second page, and one or two at the end. Those are as clear as print,"
     said he; "but the writing in between is very bad, and there are three
     places where I cannot read it at all."

==>      "What do you make of that?" said Holmes. <==

     "Well, what do you make of it?"

     "That it was written in a train; the good writing represents
     stations, the bad writing movement, and the very bad writing passing

     Norwood and London Bridge."

     Lestrade began to laugh.

     "You are too many for me when you begin to get on your theories, Mr.
==>      Holmes," said he. "How does this bear on the case?" <==

     "Well, it corroborates the young man's story to the extent that the
     will was drawn up by Jonas Oldacre in his journey yesterday. It is
     curious--is it not?--that a man should draw up so important a
     document in so haphazard a fashion. It suggests that he did not think

     one, and hoped that if the body were consumed it would hide all
     traces of the method of his death--traces which for some reason must
     have pointed to him. Is all this not obvious?"

     "It strikes me, my good Lestrade, as being just a trifle too
==>      obvious," said Holmes. "You do not add imagination to your other <==
     great qualities; but if you could for one moment put yourself in the
     place of this young man, would you choose the very night after the
     will had been made to commit your crime? Would it not seem dangerous
     to you to make so very close a relation between the two incidents?
     Again, would you choose an occasion when you are known to be in the

     house, when a servant has let you in? And, finally, would you take
     the great pains to conceal the body and yet leave your own stick as a
     sign that you were the criminal? Confess, Lestrade, that all this is
     very unlikely."

==>      "As to the stick, Mr. Holmes, you know as well as I do that a <==
     criminal is often flurried and does things which a cool man would
     avoid. He was very likely afraid to go back to the room. Give me
     another theory that would fit the facts."

     "I could very easily give you half-a-dozen," said Holmes. "Here, for

     evident value. A passing tramp sees them through the window, the

     "Because they were papers that he could not negotiate."

     Lestrade shook his head, though it seemed to me that his manner was
     less absolutely assured than before.

==>      "Well, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, you may look for your tramp, and while <==
     you are finding him we will hold on to our man. The future will show
     which is right. Just notice this point, Mr. Holmes: that so far as we
     know none of the papers were removed, and that the prisoner is the
     one man in the world who had no reason for removing them, since he
     was heir-at-law and would come into them in any case."

     "'Yes, I knew him well; in fact, he was an old suitor of mine. Thank

     Lestrade hanging our client, which will certainly be a triumph for
     Scotland Yard."

==>      I do not know how far Sherlock Holmes took any sleep that night, but <==
     when I came down to breakfast I found him pale and harassed, his
     bright eyes the brighter for the dark shadows round them. The carpet
     round his chair was littered with cigarette-ends and with the early
     editions of the morning papers. An open telegram lay upon the table.

     Lestrade.

     "This sounds serious," said I.

==>      "It is Lestrade's little cock-a-doodle of victory," Holmes answered, <==
     with a bitter smile. "And yet it may be premature to abandon the
     case. After all, important fresh evidence is a two-edged thing, and
     may possibly cut in a very different direction to that which Lestrade
     imagines. Take your breakfast, Watson, and we will go out together
     and see what we can do. I feel as if I shall need your company and

     Norwood. A crowd of morbid sightseers were still gathered round Deep
     Dene House, which was just such a suburban villa as I had pictured.
     Within the gates Lestrade met us, his face flushed with victory, his
     manner grossly triumphant.

==>      "Well, Mr. Holmes, have you proved us to be wrong yet? Have you found <==
     your tramp?" he cried.

     "I have formed no conclusion whatever," my companion answered.

     "But we formed ours yesterday, and now it proves to be correct; so

     "I have formed no conclusion whatever," my companion answered.

     "But we formed ours yesterday, and now it proves to be correct; so
     you must acknowledge that we have been a little in front of you this

     "You certainly have the air of something unusual having occurred,"
     said Holmes.

     Lestrade laughed loudly.

     Lestrade laughed loudly.

     "You don't like being beaten any more than the rest of us do," said
     he. "A man can't expect always to have it his own way, can he, Dr.

     dramatic suddenness he struck a match and by its light exposed a
     stain of blood upon the whitewashed wall. As he held the match nearer
     I saw that it was more than a stain. It was the well-marked print of
     a thumb.

==>      "Look at that with your magnifying glass, Mr. Holmes." <==

     "Yes, I am doing so."

     "You are aware that no two thumb marks are alike?"

     "That is final," said Lestrade.

     "Yes, that is final," I involuntarily echoed.

==>      "It is final," said Holmes. <==

     Something in his tone caught my ear, and I turned to look at him. An
     extraordinary change had come over his face. It was writhing with
     inward merriment. His two eyes were shining like stars. It seemed to
     me that he was making desperate efforts to restrain a convulsive

     thought it? And how deceptive appearances may be, to be sure! Such a
     nice young man to look at! It is a lesson to us not to trust our own
     judgment, is it not, Lestrade?"

     "Yes, some of us are a little too much inclined to be cocksure, Mr.
==>      Holmes," said Lestrade. The man's insolence was maddening, but we <==
     could not resent it.

     "What a providential thing that this young man should press his right
     thumb against the wall in taking his hat from the peg! Such a very
     natural action, too, if you come to think of it." Holmes was

     outwardly calm, but his whole body gave a wriggle of suppressed
     excitement as he spoke. "By the way, Lestrade, who made this
     remarkable discovery?"

     "It was the housekeeper, Mrs. Lexington, who drew the night

     the hall. Besides, it's not in a very prominent place, as you see."

     "No, no, of course not. I suppose there is no doubt that the mark was
     there yesterday?"

==>      Lestrade looked at Holmes as if he thought he was going out of his <==
     mind. I confess that I was myself surprised both at his hilarious
     manner and at his rather wild observation.

     "I don't know whether you think that McFarlane came out of jail in
     the dead of the night in order to strengthen the evidence against

     whether that is not the mark of his thumb."

     "It is unquestionably the mark of his thumb."

     "There, that's enough," said Lestrade. "I am a practical man, Mr.
==>      Holmes, and when I have got my evidence I come to my conclusions. If <==
     you have anything to say you will find me writing my report in the
     sitting-room."

     Holmes had recovered his equanimity, though I still seemed to detect
     gleams of amusement in his expression.

     "Dear me, this is a very sad development, Watson, is it not?" said
     he. "And yet there are singular points about it which hold out some
     hopes for our client."

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 33080    window = 33075 33085



     "I would hardly go so far as to say that, my dear Watson. The fact is
     that there is one really serious flaw in this evidence to which our
     friend attaches so much importance."

==>      "Indeed, Holmes! What is it?" <==

     "Only this: that I know that that mark was not there when I examined
     the hall yesterday. And now, Watson, let us have a little stroll
     round in the sunshine."

     With a confused brain, but with a heart into which some warmth of
     hope was returning, I accompanied my friend in a walk round the
==>      garden. Holmes took each face of the house in turn and examined it <==
     with great interest. He then led the way inside and went over the
     whole building from basement to attics. Most of the rooms were
     unfurnished, but none the less Holmes inspected them all minutely.
     Finally, on the top corridor, which ran outside three untenanted
     bedrooms, he again was seized with a spasm of merriment.

     into our confidence. He has had his little smile at our expense, and

     to be correct. Yes, yes; I think I see how we should approach it."

     that your evidence is not complete."

     Lestrade knew my friend too well to disregard his words. He laid down
     his pen and looked curiously at him.

==>      "What do you mean, Mr. Holmes?" <==

     "Only that there is an important witness whom you have not seen."

     "Can you produce him?"

     "I will do my best. How many constables have you?"

     "There are three within call."

     able-bodied men with powerful voices?"

     "I have no doubt they are, though I fail to see what their voices
     have to do with it."

     As I have said, there was a broad corridor there, which ran outside
     three empty bedrooms. At one end of the corridor we were all

     staring at my friend with amazement, expectation, and derision

     Lestrade's face had begun to grow red and angry.

     "I don't know whether you are playing a game with us, Mr. Sherlock

     without all this tomfoolery."

     "I assure you, my good Lestrade, that I have an excellent reason for
     everything that I do. You may possibly remember that you chaffed me a
     little some hours ago, when the sun seemed on your side of the hedge,

     It had hardly died away when an amazing thing happened. A door
     suddenly flew open out of what appeared to be solid wall at the end
     of the corridor, and a little, wizened man darted out of it, like a
     rabbit out of its burrow.

==>      "Capital!" said Holmes, calmly. "Watson, a bucket of water over the <==
     straw. That will do! Lestrade, allow me to present you with your
     principal missing witness, Mr. Jonas Oldacre."

     The detective stared at the new-comer with blank amazement. The

     "I am sure, sir, it was only my practical joke."

     "Oh! a joke, was it? You won't find the laugh on your side, I promise
     you. Take him down and keep him in the sitting-room until I come. Mr.
==>      Holmes," he continued, when they had gone, "I could not speak before <==
     the constables, but I don't mind saying, in the presence of Dr.
     Watson, that this is the brightest thing that you have done yet,
     though it is a mystery to me how you did it. You have saved an
     innocent man's life, and you have prevented a very grave scandal,
     which would have ruined my reputation in the Force."

     reputation has been enormously enhanced. Just make a few alterations
     in that report which you were writing, and they will understand how
     hard it is to throw dust in the eyes of Inspector Lestrade."

     supply of food and water were within, together with a number of books
     and papers.

     confederate--save, of course, that precious housekeeper of his, whom

     which he took with him into his retreat I will lay you a wager that
     you find the seal with the thumb-mark upon it."

     "Wonderful!" said Lestrade. "Wonderful! It's all as clear as crystal,
     as you put it. But what is the object of this deep deception, Mr.

     It was amusing to me to see how the detective's overbearing manner
     had changed suddenly to that of a child asking questions of its
     teacher.

     "That's for a jury to decide," said Lestrade. "Anyhow, we shall have

     "Have a cigarette, Mr. McFarlane," said he, pushing his case across.
==>      "I am sure that with your symptoms my friend Dr. Watson here would <==
     prescribe a sedative. The weather has been so very warm these last
     few days. Now, if you feel a little more composed, I should be glad
     if you would sit down in that chair and tell us very slowly and
     quietly who you are and what it is that you want. You mentioned your
     name as if I should recognise it, but I assure you that, beyond the

     My companion's expressive face showed a sympathy which was not, I am
     afraid, entirely unmixed with satisfaction.

     "Dear me," said he; "it was only this moment at breakfast that I was
==>      saying to my friend, Dr. Watson, that sensational cases had <==
     disappeared out of our papers."

     Our visitor stretched forward a quivering hand and picked up the
     Daily Telegraph, which still lay upon Holmes's knee.


[line number in individual story] matching line = 121    window = 116 126

     clean-shaven face, with a weak, sensitive mouth. His age may have
     been about twenty-seven; his dress and bearing that of a gentleman.
     From the pocket of his light summer overcoat protruded the bundle of
     endorsed papers which proclaimed his profession.

==>      "We must use what time we have," said Holmes. "Watson, would you have <==
     the kindness to take the paper and to read me the paragraph in
     question?"

     Underneath the vigorous head-lines which our client had quoted I read
     the following suggestive narrative:--

[line number in individual story] matching line = 452    window = 447 457

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 32750    window = 32745 32755



     When the detective departed my friend rose and made his preparations
     for the day's work with the alert air of a man who has a congenial
     task before him.

==>      "My first movement, Watson," said he, as he bustled into his <==
     frock-coat, "must, as I said, be in the direction of Blackheath."

     "And why not Norwood?"

     "Because we have in this case one singular incident coming close to

     started had not been fulfilled. For an hour he droned away upon his
     violin, endeavouring to soothe his own ruffled spirits. At last he
     flung down the instrument and plunged into a detailed account of his
     misadventures.

==>      "It's all going wrong, Watson--all as wrong as it can go. I kept a <==
     bold face before Lestrade, but, upon my soul, I believe that for once
     the fellow is on the right track and we are on the wrong. All my
     instincts are one way and all the facts are the other, and I much
     fear that British juries have not yet attained that pitch of
     intelligence when they will give the preference to my theories over

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 32786    window = 32781 32791


     intelligence when they will give the preference to my theories over
     Lestrade's facts."

     "Did you go to Blackheath?"

==>      "Yes, Watson, I went there, and I found very quickly that the late <==
     lamented Oldacre was a pretty considerable black-guard. The father
     was away in search of his son. The mother was at home--a little,
     fluffy, blue-eyed person, in a tremor of fear and indignation. Of
     course, she would not admit even the possibility of his guilt. But
     she would not express either surprise or regret over the fate of

[line number in individual story] matching line = 590    window = 585 595

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 32888    window = 32883 32893


     It burned like tinder, and by the time she reached the spot nothing
     could be seen but flames. She and all the firemen smelled the burned
     flesh from inside it. She knew nothing of the papers, nor of Mr.
     Oldacre's private affairs.

==>      "So, my dear Watson, there's my report of a failure. And yet--and <==
     yet--"--he clenched his thin hands in a paroxysm of conviction--"I
     know it's all wrong. I feel it in my bones. There is something that
     has not come out, and that housekeeper knows it. There was a sort of
     sulky defiance in her eyes, which only goes with guilty knowledge.
     However, there's no good talking any more about it, Watson; but

     unless some lucky chance comes our way I fear that the Norwood

     which I foresee that a patient public will sooner or later have to
     endure."

     "Surely," said I, "the man's appearance would go far with any jury?"

==>      "That is a dangerous argument, my dear Watson. You remember that <==
     terrible murderer, Bert Stevens, who wanted us to get him off in '87?
     Was there ever a more mild-mannered, Sunday-school young man?"

     "It is true."

     when I came down to breakfast I found him pale and harassed, his
     bright eyes the brighter for the dark shadows round them. The carpet
     round his chair was littered with cigarette-ends and with the early
     editions of the morning papers. An open telegram lay upon the table.

==>      "What do you think of this, Watson?" he asked, tossing it across. <==

     It was from Norwood, and ran as follows:

     "Important fresh evidence to hand. McFarlane's guilt definitely
     established. Advise you to abandon case.

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 32945    window = 32940 32950



     "It is Lestrade's little cock-a-doodle of victory," Holmes answered,
     with a bitter smile. "And yet it may be premature to abandon the
     case. After all, important fresh evidence is a two-edged thing, and
     may possibly cut in a very different direction to that which Lestrade
==>      imagines. Take your breakfast, Watson, and we will go out together <==
     and see what we can do. I feel as if I shall need your company and
     your moral support to-day."

     My friend had no breakfast himself, for it was one of his
     peculiarities that in his more intense moments he would permit

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 32977    window = 32972 32982



     Lestrade laughed loudly.

     "You don't like being beaten any more than the rest of us do," said
     he. "A man can't expect always to have it his own way, can he, Dr.
==>      Watson? Step this way, if you please, gentlemen, and I think I can <==
     convince you once for all that it was John McFarlane who did this
     crime."

     He led us through the passage and out into a dark hall beyond.


[line number in individual story] matching line = 771    window = 766 776

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 33069    window = 33064 33074


     sitting-room."

     Holmes had recovered his equanimity, though I still seemed to detect
     gleams of amusement in his expression.

==>      "Dear me, this is a very sad development, Watson, is it not?" said <==
     he. "And yet there are singular points about it which hold out some
     hopes for our client."

     "I am delighted to hear it," said I, heartily. "I was afraid it was
     all up with him."

[line number in individual story] matching line = 778    window = 773 783

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 33076    window = 33071 33081


     hopes for our client."

     "I am delighted to hear it," said I, heartily. "I was afraid it was
     all up with him."

==>      "I would hardly go so far as to say that, my dear Watson. The fact is <==
     that there is one really serious flaw in this evidence to which our
     friend attaches so much importance."

     "Indeed, Holmes! What is it?"


[line number in individual story] matching line = 785    window = 780 790

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 33083    window = 33078 33088


     friend attaches so much importance."

     "Indeed, Holmes! What is it?"

     "Only this: that I know that that mark was not there when I examined
==>      the hall yesterday. And now, Watson, let us have a little stroll <==
     round in the sunshine."

     With a confused brain, but with a heart into which some warmth of
     hope was returning, I accompanied my friend in a walk round the
     garden. Holmes took each face of the house in turn and examined it

[line number in individual story] matching line = 797    window = 792 802

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 33095    window = 33090 33100


     whole building from basement to attics. Most of the rooms were
     unfurnished, but none the less Holmes inspected them all minutely.
     Finally, on the top corridor, which ran outside three untenanted
     bedrooms, he again was seized with a spasm of merriment.

==>      "There are really some very unique features about this case, Watson," <==
     said he. "I think it is time now that we took our friend Lestrade
     into our confidence. He has had his little smile at our expense, and
     perhaps we may do as much by him if my reading of this problem proves
     to be correct. Yes, yes; I think I see how we should approach it."

     "In the outhouse you will find a considerable quantity of straw,"
     said Holmes. "I will ask you to carry in two bundles of it. I think
     it will be of the greatest assistance in producing the witness whom I
     require. Thank you very much. I believe you have some matches in your
==>      pocket, Watson. Now, Mr. Lestrade, I will ask you all to accompany me <==
     to the top landing."

     As I have said, there was a broad corridor there, which ran outside
     three empty bedrooms. At one end of the corridor we were all
     marshalled by Sherlock Holmes, the constables grinning and Lestrade

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 33167    window = 33162 33172



     "I assure you, my good Lestrade, that I have an excellent reason for
     everything that I do. You may possibly remember that you chaffed me a
     little some hours ago, when the sun seemed on your side of the hedge,
     so you must not grudge me a little pomp and ceremony now. Might I ask
==>      you, Watson, to open that window, and then to put a match to the edge <==
     of the straw?"

     I did so, and, driven by the draught, a coil of grey smoke swirled
     down the corridor, while the dry straw crackled and flamed.


[line number in individual story] matching line = 894    window = 889 899

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 33192    window = 33187 33197


     It had hardly died away when an amazing thing happened. A door
     suddenly flew open out of what appeared to be solid wall at the end
     of the corridor, and a little, wizened man darted out of it, like a
     rabbit out of its burrow.

==>      "Capital!" said Holmes, calmly. "Watson, a bucket of water over the <==
     straw. That will do! Lestrade, allow me to present you with your
     principal missing witness, Mr. Jonas Oldacre."

     The detective stared at the new-comer with blank amazement. The
     latter was blinking in the bright light of the corridor, and peering

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 33221    window = 33216 33226



     "Oh! a joke, was it? You won't find the laugh on your side, I promise
     you. Take him down and keep him in the sitting-room until I come. Mr.
     Holmes," he continued, when they had gone, "I could not speak before
     the constables, but I don't mind saying, in the presence of Dr.
==>      Watson, that this is the brightest thing that you have done yet, <==
     though it is a mystery to me how you did it. You have saved an
     innocent man's life, and you have prevented a very grave scandal,
     which would have ruined my reputation in the Force."

     Holmes smiled and clapped Lestrade upon the shoulder.

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 33237    window = 33232 33242



     "And you don't want your name to appear?"

     "Not at all. The work is its own reward. Perhaps I shall get the
     credit also at some distant day when I permit my zealous historian to
==>      lay out his foolscap once more--eh, Watson? Well, now, let us see <==
     where this rat has been lurking."

     A lath-and-plaster partition had been run across the passage six feet
     from the end, with a door cunningly concealed in it. It was lit
     within by slits under the eaves. A few articles of furniture and a

     "I fancy that for some few years you will find your time very fully
     occupied," said he. "By the way, what was it you put into the
     wood-pile besides your old trousers? A dead dog, or rabbits, or what?
     You won't tell? Dear me, how very unkind of you! Well, well, I dare
     say that a couple of rabbits would account both for the blood and for
==>      the charred ashes. If ever you write an account, Watson, you can make <==
     rabbits serve your turn."

     theory is that a most sensational crime has been committed, that the
     victim was clubbed to death in his own bedroom, his papers rifled,
     and his dead body dragged across to the wood-stack, which was then
     ignited so as to hide all traces of the crime. The conduct of the
     criminal investigation has been left in the experienced hands of
==>      Inspector Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, who is following up the clues <==
     with his accustomed energy and sagacity."

     Sherlock Holmes listened with closed eyes and finger-tips together to

     I have no doubt that I should have been arrested either at my City

     It was a clang of the bell, followed instantly by heavy steps upon

     McFarlane turned to us with a gesture of despair, and sank into his

     Lestrade, whose eyebrows had gone up once or twice during this
     remarkable explanation.

     "Not until I have been to Blackheath."

==>      "You mean to Norwood," said Lestrade. <==

     "Oh, yes; no doubt that is what I must have meant," said Holmes, with
     his enigmatical smile. Lestrade had learned by more experiences than
     he would care to acknowledge that that razor-like brain could cut
     through that which was impenetrable to him. I saw him look curiously

     "Not until I have been to Blackheath."

     he would care to acknowledge that that razor-like brain could cut

     "I think I should like to have a word with you presently, Mr.
     Sherlock Holmes," said he. "Now, Mr. McFarlane, two of my constables
     are at the door and there is a four-wheeler waiting." The wretched
     young man arose, and with a last beseeching glance at us walked from
==>      the room. The officers conducted him to the cab, but Lestrade <==
     remained.

     Holmes had picked up the pages which formed the rough draft of the
     will, and was looking at them with the keenest interest upon his
     face.

     Holmes had picked up the pages which formed the rough draft of the
     will, and was looking at them with the keenest interest upon his
     face.

==>      "There are some points about that document, Lestrade, are there not?" <==
     said he, pushing them over.

     The official looked at them with a puzzled expression.

     "I can read the first few lines, and these in the middle of the

     vicinity of a great city could there be so quick a succession of
     points. Granting that his whole journey was occupied in drawing up
     the will, then the train was an express, only stopping once between
     Norwood and London Bridge."

==>      Lestrade began to laugh. <==

     "You are too many for me when you begin to get on your theories, Mr.
     Holmes," said he. "How does this bear on the case?"

     "Well, it corroborates the young man's story to the extent that the

[line number in individual story] matching line = 371    window = 366 376

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 32669    window = 32664 32674


     document in so haphazard a fashion. It suggests that he did not think
     it was going to be of much practical importance. If a man drew up a
     will which he did not intend ever to be effective he might do it so."

     "Well, he drew up his own death-warrant at the same time," said
==>      Lestrade. <==

     "Oh, you think so?"

     "Don't you?"


[line number in individual story] matching line = 392    window = 387 397

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 32690    window = 32685 32695


     slight. It is probable that he imagined his crime to be a bloodless
     one, and hoped that if the body were consumed it would hide all
     traces of the method of his death--traces which for some reason must
     have pointed to him. Is all this not obvious?"

==>      "It strikes me, my good Lestrade, as being just a trifle too <==
     obvious," said Holmes. "You do not add imagination to your other
     great qualities; but if you could for one moment put yourself in the
     place of this young man, would you choose the very night after the
     will had been made to commit your crime? Would it not seem dangerous
     to you to make so very close a relation between the two incidents?

[line number in individual story] matching line = 401    window = 396 406

     will had been made to commit your crime? Would it not seem dangerous
     to you to make so very close a relation between the two incidents?
     Again, would you choose an occasion when you are known to be in the
     house, when a servant has let you in? And, finally, would you take
     the great pains to conceal the body and yet leave your own stick as a
==>      sign that you were the criminal? Confess, Lestrade, that all this is <==
     very unlikely."

     "As to the stick, Mr. Holmes, you know as well as I do that a
     criminal is often flurried and does things which a cool man would
     avoid. He was very likely afraid to go back to the room. Give me

     "And why did the tramp take nothing?"

     "Because they were papers that he could not negotiate."

==>      Lestrade shook his head, though it seemed to me that his manner was <==
     less absolutely assured than before.

     "Well, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, you may look for your tramp, and while
     you are finding him we will hold on to our man. The future will show
     which is right. Just notice this point, Mr. Holmes: that so far as we

     violin, endeavouring to soothe his own ruffled spirits. At last he
     flung down the instrument and plunged into a detailed account of his
     misadventures.

     "It's all going wrong, Watson--all as wrong as it can go. I kept a
==>      bold face before Lestrade, but, upon my soul, I believe that for once <==
     the fellow is on the right track and we are on the wrong. All my
     instincts are one way and all the facts are the other, and I much
     fear that British juries have not yet attained that pitch of
     intelligence when they will give the preference to my theories over
     Lestrade's facts."

     bold face before Lestrade, but, upon my soul, I believe that for once
     the fellow is on the right track and we are on the wrong. All my
     instincts are one way and all the facts are the other, and I much
     fear that British juries have not yet attained that pitch of
     intelligence when they will give the preference to my theories over
==>      Lestrade's facts." <==

     "Did you go to Blackheath?"

     "Yes, Watson, I went there, and I found very quickly that the late
     lamented Oldacre was a pretty considerable black-guard. The father

     of it. To the right and some distance back from the road was the
     timber-yard which had been the scene of the fire. Here's a rough plan
     on a leaf of my note-book. This window on the left is the one which
     opens into Oldacre's room. You can look into it from the road, you
     see. That is about the only bit of consolation I have had to-day.
==>      Lestrade was not there, but his head constable did the honours. They <==
     had just made a great treasure-trove. They had spent the morning
     raking among the ashes of the burned wood-pile, and besides the
     charred organic remains they had secured several discoloured metal
     discs. I examined them with care, and there was no doubt that they
     were trouser buttons. I even distinguished that one of them was

[line number in individual story] matching line = 566    window = 561 571

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 32864    window = 32859 32869


     They were not, so far as I could judge, of any great value, nor did
     the bank-book show that Mr. Oldacre was in such very affluent
     circumstances. But it seemed to me that all the papers were not
     there. There were allusions to some deeds--possibly the more
     valuable--which I could not find. This, of course, if we could
==>      definitely prove it, would turn Lestrade's argument against himself, <==
     for who would steal a thing if he knew that he would shortly inherit
     it?

     "Finally, having drawn every other cover and picked up no scent, I
     tried my luck with the housekeeper. Mrs. Lexington is her name, a

     had a hand in the affair? Cornelius might be a broker, but we have
     found no scrip to correspond with these large payments. Failing any
     other indication my researches must now take the direction of an
     inquiry at the bank for the gentleman who has cashed these cheques.
     But I fear, my dear fellow, that our case will end ingloriously by
==>      Lestrade hanging our client, which will certainly be a triumph for <==
     Scotland Yard."

     I do not know how far Sherlock Holmes took any sleep that night, but
     when I came down to breakfast I found him pale and harassed, his
     bright eyes the brighter for the dark shadows round them. The carpet

     It was from Norwood, and ran as follows:

     established. Advise you to abandon case.

     with a bitter smile. "And yet it may be premature to abandon the

     Lestrade.

     "This sounds serious," said I.

     with a bitter smile. "And yet it may be premature to abandon the

     your moral support to-day."

     My friend had no breakfast himself, for it was one of his

     energy and nerve force for digestion," he would say in answer to my
     medical remonstrances. I was not surprised, therefore, when this
     morning he left his untouched meal behind him and started with me for
     Norwood. A crowd of morbid sightseers were still gathered round Deep
     Dene House, which was just such a suburban villa as I had pictured.
==>      Within the gates Lestrade met us, his face flushed with victory, his <==
     manner grossly triumphant.

     "Well, Mr. Holmes, have you proved us to be wrong yet? Have you found
     your tramp?" he cried.

     time, Mr. Holmes."

     "You certainly have the air of something unusual having occurred,"
     said Holmes.

==>      Lestrade laughed loudly. <==

     "You don't like being beaten any more than the rest of us do," said
     he. "A man can't expect always to have it his own way, can he, Dr.
     Watson? Step this way, if you please, gentlemen, and I think I can
     convince you once for all that it was John McFarlane who did this

     As he held the waxen print close to the blood-stain it did not take a
     magnifying glass to see that the two were undoubtedly from the same
     thumb. It was evident to me that our unfortunate client was lost.

==>      "That is final," said Lestrade. <==

     "Yes, that is final," I involuntarily echoed.

     "It is final," said Holmes.

     attack of laughter.

     "Dear me! Dear me!" he said at last. "Well, now, who would have
     thought it? And how deceptive appearances may be, to be sure! Such a
     nice young man to look at! It is a lesson to us not to trust our own
==>      judgment, is it not, Lestrade?" <==

     "Yes, some of us are a little too much inclined to be cocksure, Mr.
     Holmes," said Lestrade. The man's insolence was maddening, but we
     could not resent it.

     could not resent it.

     "What a providential thing that this young man should press his right

     natural action, too, if you come to think of it." Holmes was

     "What a providential thing that this young man should press his right
     thumb against the wall in taking his hat from the peg! Such a very
     natural action, too, if you come to think of it." Holmes was
     outwardly calm, but his whole body gave a wriggle of suppressed

     remarkable discovery?"

     "It was the housekeeper, Mrs. Lexington, who drew the night

     the hall. Besides, it's not in a very prominent place, as you see."

     "No, no, of course not. I suppose there is no doubt that the mark was
     there yesterday?"

==>      Lestrade looked at Holmes as if he thought he was going out of his <==
     mind. I confess that I was myself surprised both at his hilarious
     manner and at his rather wild observation.

     the dead of the night in order to strengthen the evidence against

     "I don't know whether you think that McFarlane came out of jail in
     the dead of the night in order to strengthen the evidence against

     whether that is not the mark of his thumb."

     "It is unquestionably the mark of his thumb."

     "There, that's enough," said Lestrade. "I am a practical man, Mr.

     himself," said Lestrade. "I leave it to any expert in the world
     whether that is not the mark of his thumb."

     "It is unquestionably the mark of his thumb."

==>      "There, that's enough," said Lestrade. "I am a practical man, Mr. <==
     Holmes, and when I have got my evidence I come to my conclusions. If
     you have anything to say you will find me writing my report in the
     sitting-room."

     Holmes had recovered his equanimity, though I still seemed to detect

     unfurnished, but none the less Holmes inspected them all minutely.
     Finally, on the top corridor, which ran outside three untenanted
     bedrooms, he again was seized with a spasm of merriment.

     "There are really some very unique features about this case, Watson,"
==>      said he. "I think it is time now that we took our friend Lestrade <==
     into our confidence. He has had his little smile at our expense, and
     perhaps we may do as much by him if my reading of this problem proves
     to be correct. Yes, yes; I think I see how we should approach it."

     The Scotland Yard inspector was still writing in the parlour when

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 33111    window = 33106 33116


     "So I am."

     "Don't you think it may be a little premature? I can't help thinking
     that your evidence is not complete."

==>      Lestrade knew my friend too well to disregard his words. He laid down <==
     his pen and looked curiously at him.

     "What do you mean, Mr. Holmes?"

     "Only that there is an important witness whom you have not seen."

     "In the outhouse you will find a considerable quantity of straw,"
     said Holmes. "I will ask you to carry in two bundles of it. I think
     it will be of the greatest assistance in producing the witness whom I
     require. Thank you very much. I believe you have some matches in your

     to the top landing."

     As I have said, there was a broad corridor there, which ran outside
     three empty bedrooms. At one end of the corridor we were all
     marshalled by Sherlock Holmes, the constables grinning and Lestrade

     staring at my friend with amazement, expectation, and derision
     chasing each other across his features. Holmes stood before us with
     the air of a conjurer who is performing a trick.

     "Would you kindly send one of your constables for two buckets of

     "Would you kindly send one of your constables for two buckets of
     water? Put the straw on the floor here, free from the wall on either
     side. Now I think that we are all ready."

==>      Lestrade's face had begun to grow red and angry. <==

     "I don't know whether you are playing a game with us, Mr. Sherlock
     Holmes," said he. "If you know anything, you can surely say it
     without all this tomfoolery."

     without all this tomfoolery."

     everything that I do. You may possibly remember that you chaffed me a
     little some hours ago, when the sun seemed on your side of the hedge,
     so you must not grudge me a little pomp and ceremony now. Might I ask
     you, Watson, to open that window, and then to put a match to the edge
     of the straw?"

     of the straw?"

     I did so, and, driven by the draught, a coil of grey smoke swirled
     down the corridor, while the dry straw crackled and flamed.

==>      "Now we must see if we can find this witness for you, Lestrade. Might <==
     I ask you all to join in the cry of 'Fire!'? Now, then; one, two,
     three--"

     "Fire!" we all yelled.

     suddenly flew open out of what appeared to be solid wall at the end
     of the corridor, and a little, wizened man darted out of it, like a
     rabbit out of its burrow.

     "Capital!" said Holmes, calmly. "Watson, a bucket of water over the
==>      straw. That will do! Lestrade, allow me to present you with your <==
     principal missing witness, Mr. Jonas Oldacre."

     The detective stared at the new-comer with blank amazement. The
     latter was blinking in the bright light of the corridor, and peering
     at us and at the smouldering fire. It was an odious face--crafty,

==>      "What's this, then?" said Lestrade at last. "What have you been doing <==
     all this time, eh?"

     Oldacre gave an uneasy laugh, shrinking back from the furious red
     face of the angry detective.

     Watson, that this is the brightest thing that you have done yet,
     though it is a mystery to me how you did it. You have saved an
     innocent man's life, and you have prevented a very grave scandal,
     which would have ruined my reputation in the Force."

==>      Holmes smiled and clapped Lestrade upon the shoulder. <==

     "Instead of being ruined, my good sir, you will find that your
     reputation has been enormously enhanced. Just make a few alterations
     in that report which you were writing, and they will understand how
     hard it is to throw dust in the eyes of Inspector Lestrade."

     "And you don't want your name to appear?"

     "Not at all. The work is its own reward. Perhaps I shall get the
     credit also at some distant day when I permit my zealous historian to

     and papers.

     "There's the advantage of being a builder," said Holmes, as we came
     out. "He was able to fix up his own little hiding-place without any
     confederate--save, of course, that precious housekeeper of his, whom
==>      I should lose no time in adding to your bag, Lestrade." <==

     "I'll take your advice. But how did you know of this place, Mr.
     Holmes?"

     "I made up my mind that the fellow was in hiding in the house. When I

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 33259    window = 33254 33264


     "I made up my mind that the fellow was in hiding in the house. When I
     paced one corridor and found it six feet shorter than the
     corresponding one below, it was pretty clear where he was. I thought
     he had not the nerve to lie quiet before an alarm of fire. We could,
     of course, have gone in and taken him, but it amused me to make him
==>      reveal himself; besides, I owed you a little mystification, Lestrade, <==
     for your chaff in the morning."

     "Well, sir, you certainly got equal with me on that. But how in the
     world did you know that he was in the house at all?"

     for your chaff in the morning."

     "Well, sir, you certainly got equal with me on that. But how in the
     world did you know that he was in the house at all?"

==>      "The thumb-mark, Lestrade. You said it was final; and so it was, in a <==
     very different sense. I knew it had not been there the day before. I
     pay a good deal of attention to matters of detail, as you may have
     observed, and I had examined the hall and was sure that the wall was
     clear. Therefore, it had been put on during the night."

     put the mark upon the wall during the night, either with his own hand
     or with that of his housekeeper. If you examine among those documents
     which he took with him into his retreat I will lay you a wager that
     you find the seal with the thumb-mark upon it."

==>      "Wonderful!" said Lestrade. "Wonderful! It's all as clear as crystal, <==
     as you put it. But what is the object of this deep deception, Mr.
     Holmes?"

     It was amusing to me to see how the detective's overbearing manner
     had changed suddenly to that of a child asking questions of its

     admirable. It was a net from which it seemed to me a few hours ago
     that there was no possible escape. But he had not that supreme gift
     of the artist, the knowledge of when to stop. He wished to improve
     that which was already perfect--to draw the rope tighter yet round
     the neck of his unfortunate victim--and so he ruined all. Let us
==>      descend, Lestrade. There are just one or two questions that I would <==
     ask him."

     The malignant creature was seated in his own parlour with a policeman
     upon each side of him.

     whined incessantly. "I assure you, sir, that I simply concealed
     myself in order to see the effect of my disappearance, and I am sure
     that you would not be so unjust as to imagine that I would have
     allowed any harm to befall poor young Mr. McFarlane."

==>      "That's for a jury to decide," said Lestrade. "Anyhow, we shall have <==
     you on a charge of conspiracy, if not for attempted murder."

     "And you'll probably find that your creditors will impound the
     banking account of Mr. Cornelius," said Holmes.
