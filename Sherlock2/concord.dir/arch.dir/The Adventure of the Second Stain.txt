     I had intended "The Adventure of the Abbey Grange" to be the last of
==>      those exploits of my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, which I should ever <==
     communicate to the public. This resolution of mine was not due to any
     lack of material, since I have notes of many hundreds of cases to
     which I have never alluded, nor was it caused by any waning interest
     on the part of my readers in the singular personality and unique
     methods of this remarkable man. The real reason lay in the reluctance

     lack of material, since I have notes of many hundreds of cases to
     which I have never alluded, nor was it caused by any waning interest
     on the part of my readers in the singular personality and unique
     methods of this remarkable man. The real reason lay in the reluctance
==>      which Mr. Holmes has shown to the continued publication of his <==
     experiences. So long as he was in actual professional practice the
     records of his successes were of some practical value to him; but
     since he has definitely retired from London and betaken himself to
     study and bee-farming on the Sussex Downs, notoriety has become
     hateful to him, and he has peremptorily requested that his wishes in

     and the most rising statesman in the country. They sat side by side
     upon our paper-littered settee, and it was easy to see from their
     worn and anxious faces that it was business of the most pressing
     importance which had brought them. The Premier's thin, blue-veined
     hands were clasped tightly over the ivory head of his umbrella, and
==>      his gaunt, ascetic face looked gloomily from Holmes to me. The <==
     European Secretary pulled nervously at his moustache and fidgeted
     with the seals of his watch-chain.

     "When I discovered my loss, Mr. Holmes, which was at eight o'clock
     this morning, I at once informed the Prime Minister. It was at his

     hands were clasped tightly over the ivory head of his umbrella, and
     his gaunt, ascetic face looked gloomily from Holmes to me. The
     European Secretary pulled nervously at his moustache and fidgeted
     with the seals of his watch-chain.

==>      "When I discovered my loss, Mr. Holmes, which was at eight o'clock <==
     this morning, I at once informed the Prime Minister. It was at his
     suggestion that we have both come to you."

     "Have you informed the police?"

     "I understand. Now, Mr. Trelawney Hope, I should be much obliged if
     you would tell me exactly the circumstances under which this document
     disappeared."

==>      "That can be done in a very few words, Mr. Holmes. The letter--for it <==
     was a letter from a foreign potentate--was received six days ago. It
     was of such importance that I have never left it in my safe, but I
     have taken it across each evening to my house in Whitehall Terrace,
     and kept it in my bedroom in a locked despatch-box. It was there last
     night. Of that I am certain. I actually opened the box while I was

     "You do me no more than justice, sir. Until this morning I have never
     breathed one word to my wife upon this matter."

     "Could she have guessed?"

==>      "No, Mr. Holmes, she could not have guessed--nor could anyone have <==
     guessed."

     "Have you lost any documents before?"

     "No, sir."

     hands tore at his hair. For a moment we caught a glimpse of the
     natural man, impulsive, ardent, keenly sensitive. The next the
     aristocratic mask was replaced, and the gentle voice had returned.
     "Besides the members of the Cabinet there are two, or possibly three,
     departmental officials who know of the letter. No one else in
==>      England, Mr. Holmes, I assure you." <==

     "But abroad?"

     "I believe that no one abroad has seen it save the man who wrote it.
     I am well convinced that his Ministers--that the usual official

     "I believe that no one abroad has seen it save the man who wrote it.
     I am well convinced that his Ministers--that the usual official
     channels have not been employed."

==>      Holmes considered for some little time. <==

     "Now, sir, I must ask you more particularly what this document is,
     and why its disappearance should have such momentous consequences?"

     The two statesmen exchanged a quick glance and the Premier's shaggy

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 43303    window = 43298 43308


     and why its disappearance should have such momentous consequences?"

     The two statesmen exchanged a quick glance and the Premier's shaggy
     eyebrows gathered in a frown.

==>      "Mr. Holmes, the envelope is a long, thin one of pale blue colour. <==
     There is a seal of red wax stamped with a crouching lion. It is
     addressed in large, bold handwriting to--"

     "I fear, sir," said Holmes, "that, interesting and indeed essential
     as these details are, my inquiries must go more to the root of

     "Mr. Holmes, the envelope is a long, thin one of pale blue colour.
     There is a seal of red wax stamped with a crouching lion. It is
     addressed in large, bold handwriting to--"

==>      "I fear, sir," said Holmes, "that, interesting and indeed essential <==
     as these details are, my inquiries must go more to the root of
     things. What was the letter?"

     "That is a State secret of the utmost importance, and I fear that I
     cannot tell you, nor do I see that it is necessary. If by the aid of

     the powers which you are said to possess you can find such an
     envelope as I describe with its enclosure, you will have deserved
     well of your country, and earned any reward which it lies in our
     power to bestow."

==>      Sherlock Holmes rose with a smile. <==

     "You are two of the most busy men in the country," said he, "and in
     my own small way I have also a good many calls upon me. I regret
     exceedingly that I cannot help you in this matter, and any
     continuation of this interview would be a waste of time."

     deep-set eyes before which a Cabinet has cowered. "I am not
     accustomed, sir--" he began, but mastered his anger and resumed his
     seat. For a minute or more we all sat in silence. Then the old
     statesman shrugged his shoulders.

==>      "We must accept your terms, Mr. Holmes. No doubt you are right, and <==
     it is unreasonable for us to expect you to act unless we give you our
     entire confidence."

     "I agree with you, sir," said the younger statesman.


[line number in individual story] matching line = 210    window = 205 215

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 43355    window = 43350 43360


     publication would undoubtedly lead to a most dangerous state of
     feeling in this country. There would be such a ferment, sir, that I
     do not hesitate to say that within a week of the publication of that
     letter this country would be involved in a great war."

==>      Holmes wrote a name upon a slip of paper and handed it to the <==
     Premier.

     "Exactly. It was he. And it is this letter--this letter which may
     well mean the expenditure of a thousand millions and the lives of a
     hundred thousand men--which has become lost in this unaccountable

     this letter were to come out."

     "If this is so, whose interest is it that the letter should come out?
     Why should anyone desire to steal it or to publish it?"

==>      "There, Mr. Holmes, you take me into regions of high international <==
     politics. But if you consider the European situation you will have no
     difficulty in perceiving the motive. The whole of Europe is an armed
     camp. There is a double league which makes a fair balance of military
     power. Great Britain holds the scales. If Britain were driven into
     war with one confederacy, it would assure the supremacy of the other

     Mr. Trelawney Hope dropped his head on his chest and groaned aloud.
     The Premier placed his hand kindly upon his shoulder.

     "It is your misfortune, my dear fellow. No one can blame you. There
==>      is no precaution which you have neglected. Now, Mr. Holmes, you are <==
     in full possession of the facts. What course do you recommend?"

     Holmes shook his head mournfully.

     "You think, sir, that unless this document is recovered there will be

     "It is your misfortune, my dear fellow. No one can blame you. There
     is no precaution which you have neglected. Now, Mr. Holmes, you are
     in full possession of the facts. What course do you recommend?"

==>      Holmes shook his head mournfully. <==

     "You think, sir, that unless this document is recovered there will be
     war?"

     "I think it is very probable."

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 43414    window = 43409 43419



     "I think it is very probable."

     "Then, sir, prepare for war."

==>      "That is a hard saying, Mr. Holmes." <==

     "Consider the facts, sir. It is inconceivable that it was taken after
     eleven-thirty at night, since I understand that Mr. Hope and his wife
     were both in the room from that hour until the loss was found out. It
     was taken, then, yesterday evening between seven-thirty and

     chance have we now to overtake or even to trace it? It is beyond our
     reach."

     The Prime Minister rose from the settee.

==>      "What you say is perfectly logical, Mr. Holmes. I feel that the <==
     matter is indeed out of our hands."

     "Let us presume, for argument's sake, that the document was taken by
     the maid or by the valet--"

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 43457    window = 43452 43462


     "I fancy not. These agents work independently, and their relations
     with the Embassies are often strained."

     The Prime Minister nodded his acquiescence.

==>      "I believe you are right, Mr. Holmes. He would take so valuable a <==
     prize to head-quarters with his own hands. I think that your course
     of action is an excellent one. Meanwhile, Hope, we cannot neglect all
     our other duties on account of this one misfortune. Should there be
     any fresh developments during the day we shall communicate with you,
     and you will no doubt let us know the results of your own inquiries."

     any fresh developments during the day we shall communicate with you,
     and you will no doubt let us know the results of your own inquiries."

     The two statesmen bowed and walked gravely from the room.

==>      When our illustrious visitors had departed Holmes lit his pipe in <==
     silence, and sat for some time lost in the deepest thought. I had
     opened the morning paper and was immersed in a sensational crime
     which had occurred in London the night before, when my friend gave an
     exclamation, sprang to his feet, and laid his pipe down upon the
     mantelpiece.

     for there had been no attempt to remove the valuable contents of the
     room. Mr. Eduardo Lucas was so well known and popular that his
     violent and mysterious fate will arouse painful interest and intense
     sympathy in a wide-spread circle of friends.

==>      "Well, Watson, what do you make of this?" asked Holmes, after a long <==
     pause.

     "It is an amazing coincidence."

     "A coincidence! Here is one of the three men whom we had named as

     Lucas than for the others to establish a connection or receive a
     message from the European Secretary's household--a small thing, and
     yet where events are compressed into a few hours it may prove
     essential. Halloa! what have we here?"

==>      Mrs. Hudson had appeared with a lady's card upon her salver. Holmes <==
     glanced at it, raised his eyebrows, and handed it over to me.

     "Ask Lady Hilda Trelawney Hope if she will be kind enough to step
     up," said he.

     was the brightness of fever; the sensitive mouth was tight and drawn
     in an effort after self-command. Terror--not beauty--was what sprang
     first to the eye as our fair visitor stood framed for an instant in
     the open door.

==>      "Has my husband been here, Mr. Holmes?" <==

     "Yes, madam, he has been here."

     "Mr. Holmes, I implore you not to tell him that I came here." Holmes
     bowed coldly, and motioned the lady to a chair.

     "Has my husband been here, Mr. Holmes?"

     "Yes, madam, he has been here."

==>      "Mr. Holmes, I implore you not to tell him that I came here." Holmes <==
     bowed coldly, and motioned the lady to a chair.

     "Your ladyship places me in a very delicate position. I beg that you
     will sit down and tell me what you desire; but I fear that I cannot
     make any unconditional promise."

     She swept across the room and seated herself with her back to the
     window. It was a queenly presence--tall, graceful, and intensely
     womanly.

==>      "Mr. Holmes," she said, and her white-gloved hands clasped and <==
     unclasped as she spoke--"I will speak frankly to you in the hope that
     it may induce you to speak frankly in return. There is complete
     confidence between my husband and me on all matters save one. That
     one is politics. On this his lips are sealed. He tells me nothing.
     Now, I am aware that there was a most deplorable occurrence in our

     house last night. I know that a paper has disappeared. But because
     the matter is political my husband refuses to take me into his
     complete confidence. Now it is essential--essential, I say--that I
     should thoroughly understand it. You are the only other person, save
     only these politicians, who knows the true facts. I beg you, then,
==>      Mr. Holmes, to tell me exactly what has happened and what it will <==
     lead to. Tell me all, Mr. Holmes. Let no regard for your client's
     interests keep you silent, for I assure you that his interests, if he
     would only see it, would be best served by taking me into his
     complete confidence. What was this paper which was stolen?"

     learned the true facts under the pledge of professional secrecy, to
     tell what he has withheld? It is not fair to ask it. It is him whom

     unfortunate effect."

     "Ah!" She drew in her breath sharply as one whose doubts are
     resolved.

==>      "One more question, Mr. Holmes. From an expression which my husband <==
     dropped in the first shock of this disaster I understood that
     terrible public consequences might arise from the loss of this
     document."

     "If he said so, I certainly cannot deny it."

     "Of what nature are they?"

     "Nay, madam, there again you ask me more than I can possibly answer."

     "Then I will take up no more of your time. I cannot blame you, Mr.

     will not, I am sure, think the worse of me because I desire, even
     against his will, to share my husband's anxieties. Once more I beg
     that you will say nothing of my visit." She looked back at us from
     the door, and I had a last impression of that beautiful haunted face,
     the startled eyes, and the drawn mouth. Then she was gone.

     the startled eyes, and the drawn mouth. Then she was gone.

==>      "Now, Watson, the fair sex is your department," said Holmes, with a <==
     smile, when the dwindling frou-frou of skirts had ended in the slam
     of the front door. "What was the fair lady's game? What did she
     really want?"

     "Surely her own statement is clear and her anxiety very natural."

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 43695    window = 43690 43700


     inkling as to what form it may take. It is a capital mistake to
     theorize in advance of the facts. Do you stay on guard, my good
     Watson, and receive any fresh visitors. I'll join you at lunch if I
     am able."

==>      All that day and the next and the next Holmes was in a mood which his <==
     friends would call taciturn, and others morose. He ran out and ran
     in, smoked incessantly, played snatches on his violin, sank into
     reveries, devoured sandwiches at irregular hours, and hardly answered
     the casual questions which I put to him. It was evident to me that
     things were not going well with him or his quest. He would say

     left in charge of the Godolphin Street house. As to the housekeeper,
     she had heard nothing on the night of the crime. If her master had a
     visitor he had himself admitted him.

     So for three mornings the mystery remained, so far as I could follow
==>      it in the papers. If Holmes knew more he kept his own counsel, but, <==
     as he told me that Inspector Lestrade had taken him into his
     confidence in the case, I knew that he was in close touch with every
     development. Upon the fourth day there appeared a long telegram from
     Paris which seemed to solve the whole question.

     coherent account of the past, and the doctors hold out no hopes of
     the re-establishment of her reason. There is evidence that a woman,
     who might have been Mme. Fournaye, was seen for some hours on Monday
     night watching the house in Godolphin Street.

==>      "What do you think of that, Holmes?" I had read the account aloud to <==
     him, while he finished his breakfast.

     "My dear Watson," said he, as he rose from the table and paced up and
     down the room, "you are most long-suffering, but if I have told you
     nothing in the last three days it is because there is nothing to

     apartment, the pictures, the rugs, and the hangings, all pointed to a
     taste which was luxurious to the verge of effeminacy.

     "Seen the Paris news?" asked Lestrade.

     "Our French friends seem to have touched the spot this time. No doubt
     it's just as they say. She knocked at the door--surprise visit, I
     guess, for he kept his life in water-tight compartments. He let her
     in--couldn't keep her in the street. She told him how she had traced

     dagger so handy the end soon came. It wasn't all done in an instant,
     though, for these chairs were all swept over yonder, and he had one
     in his hand as if he had tried to hold her off with it. We've got it

     "Ah, yes, that's another matter--a mere trifle, but the sort of thing
     you take an interest in--queer, you know, and what you might call

     "Yes? You found--"

     "Well, I'm sure you would never guess in a hundred years what we did
     find. You see that stain on the carpet? Well, a great deal must have
     soaked through, must it not?"

     "Now I'll show you the explanation. There is a second stain, but it
     does not correspond with the other. See for yourself." As he spoke he
     turned over another portion of the carpet, and there, sure enough,
     was a great crimson spill upon the square white facing of the
==>      old-fashioned floor. "What do you make of that, Mr. Holmes?" <==

     "Why, it is simple enough. The two stains did correspond, but the
     carpet has been turned round. As it was square and unfastened it was
     easily done."

     "By George, if he knows I'll have it out of him!" cried Lestrade. He
     darted into the hall, and a few moments later his bullying voice
     sounded from the back room.

     demoniacal force of the man masked behind that listless manner burst
     out in a paroxysm of energy. He tore the drugget from the floor, and
     in an instant was down on his hands and knees clawing at each of the
     squares of wood beneath it. One turned sideways as he dug his nails
     into the edge of it. It hinged back like the lid of a box. A small

     MacPherson," said Lestrade, with dignity. "No doubt you thought that
     your breach of duty could never be discovered, and yet a mere glance
     at that drugget was enough to convince me that someone had been
     admitted to the room. It's lucky for you, my man, that nothing is

     When we arrived at the residence of the European Secretary it was for

     shown into the morning-room.

     from her beautiful face. Her eyes glazed--she tottered--I thought
     that she would faint. Then with a grand effort she rallied from the
     shock, and a supreme astonishment and indignation chased every other
     expression from her features.

     "Come, come, madam, it is useless. Give up the letter."

     She darted to the bell.

     She stood grandly defiant, a queenly figure, her eyes fixed upon his

     had forborne to ring it.

     "You are trying to frighten me. It is not a very manly thing, Mr.

     "One is enough, Lady Hilda. I know of your visit to Eduardo Lucas, of
     your giving him this document, of your ingenious return to the room
     last night, and of the manner in which you took the letter from the
     hiding-place under the carpet."

     She stared at him with an ashen face and gulped twice before she
     could speak.

==>      "You are mad, Mr. Holmes--you are mad!" she cried, at last. <==

     He drew a small piece of cardboard from his pocket. It was the face
     of a woman cut out of a portrait.

     "I have carried this because I thought it might be useful," said he.

     this man Lucas furnished a duplicate. I opened his despatch-box, took
     the paper, and conveyed it to Godolphin Street."

     "What happened there, madam?"

     The European Secretary burst excitedly into the room.

     "I have some hopes."

     "Ah, thank heaven!" His face became radiant. "The Prime Minister is

     The Prime Minister's manner was subdued, but I could see by the gleam
     of his eyes and the twitchings of his bony hands that he shared the
     excitement of his young colleague.

==>      "I understand that you have something to report, Mr. Holmes?" <==

     "Purely negative as yet," my friend answered. "I have inquired at
     every point where it might be, and I am sure that there is no danger
     to be apprehended."

     that it left the box."

     "Have you examined the box since Tuesday morning?"

     "No; it was not necessary."

     for there had been no attempt to remove the valuable contents of the

     violent and mysterious fate will arouse painful interest and intense
     sympathy in a wide-spread circle of friends.

     "It is an amazing coincidence."

     against his will, to share my husband's anxieties. Once more I beg
     that you will say nothing of my visit." She looked back at us from
     the door, and I had a last impression of that beautiful haunted face,
     the startled eyes, and the drawn mouth. Then she was gone.

==>      "Now, Watson, the fair sex is your department," said Holmes, with a <==
     smile, when the dwindling frou-frou of skirts had ended in the slam
     of the front door. "What was the fair lady's game? What did she

     to have the light at her back. She did not wish us to read her

     on such a quicksand? Their most trivial action may mean volumes, or
     their most extraordinary conduct may depend upon a hairpin or a

     "Yes; I will wile away the morning at Godolphin Street with our

     night watching the house in Godolphin Street.

     "What do you think of that, Holmes?" I had read the account aloud to
     him, while he finished his breakfast.

     down the room, "you are most long-suffering, but if I have told you
     nothing in the last three days it is because there is nothing to
     tell. Even now this report from Paris does not help us much."

     brain like a hammer. Was it, indeed, a coincidence that Lucas should
     meet his death on the night when the letter disappeared? Did the
     letter ever reach him? If so, why is it not among his papers? Did
     this mad wife of his carry it off with her? If so, is it in her house
     in Paris? How could I search for it without the French police having
==>      their suspicions aroused? It is a case, my dear Watson, where the law <==
     is as dangerous to us as the criminals are. Every man's hand is
     against us, and yet the interests at stake are colossal. Should I
     bring it to a successful conclusion it will certainly represent the
     crowning glory of my career. Ah, here is my latest from the front!"
     He glanced hurriedly at the note which had been handed in. "Halloa!

     against us, and yet the interests at stake are colossal. Should I

     He glanced hurriedly at the note which had been handed in. "Halloa!
     Lestrade seems to have observed something of interest. Put on your

     It was my first visit to the scene of the crime--a high, dingy,
     narrow-chested house, prim, formal, and solid, like the century which
     gave it birth. Lestrade's bulldog features gazed out at us from the
     front window, and he greeted us warmly when a big constable had

     "By George, if he knows I'll have it out of him!" cried Lestrade. He
     darted into the hall, and a few moments later his bullying voice
     sounded from the back room.

==>      "Now, Watson, now!" cried Holmes, with frenzied eagerness. All the <==
     demoniacal force of the man masked behind that listless manner burst
     out in a paroxysm of energy. He tore the drugget from the floor, and
     in an instant was down on his hands and knees clawing at each of the
     squares of wood beneath it. One turned sideways as he dug his nails
     into the edge of it. It hinged back like the lid of a box. A small

     into the edge of it. It hinged back like the lid of a box. A small
     black cavity opened beneath it. Holmes plunged his eager hand into
     it, and drew it out with a bitter snarl of anger and disappointment.
     It was empty.

==>      "Quick, Watson, quick! Get it back again!" The wooden lid was <==
     replaced, and the drugget had only just been drawn straight when
     Lestrade's voice was heard in the passage. He found Holmes leaning
     languidly against the mantelpiece, resigned and patient, endeavouring
     to conceal his irrepressible yawns.

     as I came back with the brandy."

     important work elsewhere."

     As we left the house Lestrade remained in the front room, while the
     repentant constable opened the door to let us out. Holmes turned on
     the step and held up something in his hand. The constable stared

     intently.

     "Good Lord, sir!" he cried, with amazement on his face. Holmes put
     his finger on his lips, replaced his hand in his breast-pocket, and
     burst out laughing as we turned down the street. "Excellent!" said
==>      he. "Come, friend Watson, the curtain rings up for the last act. You <==
     will be relieved to hear that there will be no war, that the Right
     Honourable Trelawney Hope will suffer no set-back in his brilliant

     My mind filled with admiration for this extraordinary man.

     "You have solved it!" I cried.

     ever. But we have so much that it will be our own fault if we cannot
     get the rest. We will go straight to Whitehall Terrace and bring the
     matter to a head."

     yet where events are compressed into a few hours it may prove
     essential. Halloa! what have we here?"

==>      Mrs. Hudson had appeared with a lady's card upon her salver. Holmes <==
     glanced at it, raised his eyebrows, and handed it over to me.

     "Ask Lady Hilda Trelawney Hope if she will be kind enough to step

     she had heard nothing on the night of the crime. If her master had a
     visitor he had himself admitted him.

     So for three mornings the mystery remained, so far as I could follow
     it in the papers. If Holmes knew more he kept his own counsel, but,
==>      as he told me that Inspector Lestrade had taken him into his <==
     confidence in the case, I knew that he was in close touch with every
     development. Upon the fourth day there appeared a long telegram from
     Paris which seemed to solve the whole question.

     A discovery has just been made by the Parisian police [said the Daily

     is as dangerous to us as the criminals are. Every man's hand is
     against us, and yet the interests at stake are colossal. Should I
     bring it to a successful conclusion it will certainly represent the
     crowning glory of my career. Ah, here is my latest from the front!"
     He glanced hurriedly at the note which had been handed in. "Halloa!
==>      Lestrade seems to have observed something of interest. Put on your <==
     hat, Watson, and we will stroll down together to Westminster."

     It was my first visit to the scene of the crime--a high, dingy,
     narrow-chested house, prim, formal, and solid, like the century which
     gave it birth. Lestrade's bulldog features gazed out at us from the

     It was my first visit to the scene of the crime--a high, dingy,

     front window, and he greeted us warmly when a big constable had
     opened the door and let us in. The room into which we were shown was
     that in which the crime had been committed, but no trace of it now
     remained, save an ugly, irregular stain upon the carpet. This carpet
     was a small square drugget in the centre of the room, surrounded by a

     of weapons, one of which had been used on that tragic night. In the
     window was a sumptuous writing-desk, and every detail of the
     apartment, the pictures, the rugs, and the hangings, all pointed to a
     taste which was luxurious to the verge of effeminacy.

==>      "Seen the Paris news?" asked Lestrade. <==

     Holmes nodded.

     "Our French friends seem to have touched the spot this time. No doubt
     it's just as they say. She knocked at the door--surprise visit, I

     showed that it was indeed as he said.

     "But the underside is as stained as the upper. It must have left a
     mark."

==>      Lestrade chuckled with delight at having puzzled the famous expert. <==

     "Now I'll show you the explanation. There is a second stain, but it
     does not correspond with the other. See for yourself." As he spoke he
     turned over another portion of the carpet, and there, sure enough,
     was a great crimson spill upon the square white facing of the

     want to know is, who shifted the carpet, and why?"

     I could see from Holmes's rigid face that he was vibrating with
     inward excitement.

==>      "Look here, Lestrade," said he, "has that constable in the passage <==
     been in charge of the place all the time?"

     "Yes, he has."

     "Well, take my advice. Examine him carefully. Don't do it before us.

     admit people and leave them alone in this room. Don't ask him if he

     here. Press him. Tell him that a full confession is his only chance
     of forgiveness. Do exactly what I tell you!"

==>      "By George, if he knows I'll have it out of him!" cried Lestrade. He <==
     darted into the hall, and a few moments later his bullying voice
     sounded from the back room.

     "Now, Watson, now!" cried Holmes, with frenzied eagerness. All the
     demoniacal force of the man masked behind that listless manner burst

     it, and drew it out with a bitter snarl of anger and disappointment.
     It was empty.

     "Quick, Watson, quick! Get it back again!" The wooden lid was
     replaced, and the drugget had only just been drawn straight when
==>      Lestrade's voice was heard in the passage. He found Holmes leaning <==
     languidly against the mantelpiece, resigned and patient, endeavouring
     to conceal his irrepressible yawns.

     "Sorry to keep you waiting, Mr. Holmes. I can see that you are bored
     to death with the whole affair. Well, he has confessed, all right.

     "Well, sir, it was a bit rumpled, certainly, when I came back. You
     see, she fell on it, and it lies on a polished floor with nothing to
     keep it in place. I straightened it out afterwards."

     "It's a lesson to you that you can't deceive me, Constable
==>      MacPherson," said Lestrade, with dignity. "No doubt you thought that <==
     your breach of duty could never be discovered, and yet a mere glance
     at that drugget was enough to convince me that someone had been
     admitted to the room. It's lucky for you, my man, that nothing is
     missing, or you would find yourself in Queer Street. I'm sorry to
     have called you down over such a petty business, Mr. Holmes, but I

     as I came back with the brandy."

     "Very good," said Holmes. "Come, Watson, I think that we have more
     important work elsewhere."

==>      As we left the house Lestrade remained in the front room, while the <==
     repentant constable opened the door to let us out. Holmes turned on
     the step and held up something in his hand. The constable stared
