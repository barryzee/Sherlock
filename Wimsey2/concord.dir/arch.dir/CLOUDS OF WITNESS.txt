==> Lord Peter Wimsey stretched himself luxuriously between the sheets <==
provided by the Hôtel Meurice. After his exertions in the unravelling of
the Battersea Mystery, he had followed Sir Julian Freke's advice and
taken a holiday. He had felt suddenly weary of breakfasting every
morning before his view over the Green Park; he had realised that the
picking up of first editions at sales afforded insufficient exercise for

Lord Peter looked at his watch.

"Ten o'clock," he said. "Very well. You did quite right. Dear me! Poor
old Gerald arrested for murder. Uncommonly worryin' for him, poor chap.
Always hated my bein' mixed up with police-courts. Now he's there
==> himself. Lord Peter Wimsey in the witness-box--very distressin' to <==
feelin's of a brother. Duke of Denver in the dock--worse still. Dear me!
Well, I suppose one must have breakfast."

"Yes, my lord. Full account of the inquest in the paper, my lord."

    shooting-box, Riddlesdale Lodge. Evidence was given to show
    that deceased had quarrelled with the Duke of Denver on the
    preceding evening, and was subsequently shot in a small
    thicket adjoining the house. A pistol belonging to the Duke
    was found near the scene of the crime. A verdict of murder
==>     was returned against the Duke of Denver. Lady Mary Wimsey, <==
    sister of the Duke, who was engaged to be married to the
    deceased, collapsed after giving evidence, and is now lying
    seriously ill at the Lodge. The Duchess of Denver hastened
    from town yesterday and was present at the inquest. Full
    report on p. 12."

always said not, but Mary never would let on about herself."

The full report began by describing the little village of Riddlesdale,
where the Duke of Denver had recently taken a small shooting-box for the
season. When the tragedy occurred the Duke had been staying there with a
==> party of guests. In the Duchess's absence Lady Mary Wimsey had acted as <==
hostess. The other guests were Colonel and Mrs. Marchbanks, the Hon.
Frederick Arbuthnot, Mr. and Mrs. Pettigrew-Robinson, and the dead man,
Denis Cathcart.

The first witness was the Duke of Denver, who claimed to have discovered

[line number in individual story] matching line = 152    window = 147 157

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 7444    window = 7439 7449


conservatory door at three o'clock in the morning of Thursday, October
14th, when his foot struck against something. He had switched on his
electric torch and seen the body of Denis Cathcart at his feet. He had
at once turned it over, and seen that Cathcart had been shot in the
chest. He was quite dead. As Denver was bending over the body, he heard
==> a cry in the conservatory, and, looking up, saw Lady Mary Wimsey gazing <==
out horror-struck. She came out by the conservatory door, and exclaimed
at once, "O God, Gerald, you've killed him!" (Sensation.)[1]

The Coroner: "Were you surprised by that remark?"


[line number in individual story] matching line = 163    window = 158 168

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 7455    window = 7450 7460


Duke of D.: "Well, I was so shocked and surprised at the whole thing. I
think I said to her, 'Don't look,' and she said, 'Oh, it's Denis!
Whatever can have happened? Has there been an accident?' I stayed with
the body, and sent her up to rouse the house."

==> The Coroner: "Did you expect to see Lady Mary Wimsey in the <==
conservatory?"

Duke of D.: "Really, as I say, I was so astonished all round, don't you
know, I didn't think about it."

The Coroner: "Do you remember how she was dressed?"

Duke of D.: "I don't think she was in her pyjamas." (Laughter.) "I think
she had a coat on."

==> The Coroner: "I understand that Lady Mary Wimsey was engaged to be <==
married to the deceased?"

Duke of D.: "Yes."

The Coroner: "He was well known to you?"

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 7717    window = 7712 7722


it?"

Duke of D.: "Not unless Fleming remembers it."

The Coroner: "Ah yes! No doubt we can check it that way. Thank you, your
==> grace. Call Lady Mary Wimsey." <==

The noble lady, who was, until the tragic morning of October 14th, the
fiancée of the deceased, aroused a murmur of sympathy on her appearance.
Fair and slender, her naturally rose-pink cheeks ashy pale, she seemed
overwhelmed with grief. She was dressed entirely in black, and gave her

[line number in individual story] matching line = 722    window = 717 727

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 8014    window = 8009 8019


could swear positively that she heard no shot in the night. Her window
was next to Lady Mary's, on the opposite side from the conservatory. She
had always been accustomed from a child to sleep with her window open.
In reply to a question from the Coroner, Mrs. Pettigrew-Robinson said
she had never felt there was a real, true affection between Lady Mary
==> Wimsey and deceased. They seemed very off-hand, but that sort of thing <==
was the fashion nowadays. She had never heard of any disagreement.

Miss Lydia Cathcart, who had been hurriedly summoned from town, then
gave evidence about the deceased man. She told the Coroner that she was
the Captain's aunt and his only surviving relative. She had seen very

[line number in individual story] matching line = 885    window = 880 890

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 8177    window = 8172 8182


remember also that in Dr. Thorpe's opinion, death had not immediately
followed the wound. If they believed this evidence, therefore, they
would have to put back the moment of death to between eleven p.m. and
midnight, and this might very well have been the shot which the
gamekeeper heard. In that case they had still to ask themselves about
==> the shot which had awakened Lady Mary Wimsey. Of course, if they liked <==
to put that down to poachers, there was no inherent impossibility.

They next came to the body of deceased, which had been discovered by the
Duke of Denver at three a.m. lying outside the door of the small
conservatory, near the covered well. There seemed little doubt, from the

[line number in individual story] matching line = 1065    window = 1060 1070

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 8357    window = 8352 8362


the inquest information which, if openly given, might have precluded the
arrest of the Duke. He had officiously detained the whole unhappy party,
on the grounds that he wanted to re-examine everybody, and was thus
keeping them miserably cooped up together over a horrible Sunday; and he
had put the coping-stone on his offences by turning out to be an
==> intimate friend of Lord Peter Wimsey's, and having, in consequence, to <==
be accommodated with a bed in the gamekeeper's cottage and breakfast at
the Lodge.

Mr. Murbles, who was elderly and had a delicate digestion, had travelled
up in a hurry on Thursday night. He had found the inquest very

"Her grace's brother-in-law."

"Peter?" said the Duchess. "Mr. Parker must be amused at the family
amateur," she added.

==> "Not at all," said Parker. "Wimsey would be one of the finest detectives <==
in England if he wasn't lazy. Only we can't get hold of him."

"I've wired to Ajaccio--poste restante," said Mr. Murbles, "but I don't
know when he's likely to call there. He said nothing about when he was
coming back to England."

behaved most improperly. He had no business to give such a summing-up.
With a jury of ignorant country fellows, what could one expect? And the
details that were allowed to come out! If I could have got here
earlier----"

==> "I'm afraid that was partly my fault, Wimsey," said Parker penitently. <==
"Craikes rather resents me. The Chief Constable at Stapley sent to us
over his head, and when the message came through I ran along to the
Chief and asked for the job, because I thought if there should be any
misconception or difficulty, you see, you'd just as soon I tackled it as
anybody else. I had a few little arrangements to make about a forgery

inquest for that morning--which was ridiculous--and arranged to produce
their blessed evidence as dramatically as possible. I only had time to
skim over the ground (disfigured, I'm sorry to say, by the prints of
Craikes and his local ruffians), and really had nothing for the jury."

==> "Cheer up," said Wimsey. "I'm not blaming you. Besides, it all lends <==
excitement to the chase."

"Fact is," said the Hon. Freddy, "that we ain't popular with respectable
Coroners. Giddy aristocrats and immoral Frenchmen. I say, Peter, sorry
you've missed Miss Lydia Cathcart. You'd have loved her. She's gone back

"Fact is," said the Hon. Freddy, "that we ain't popular with respectable
Coroners. Giddy aristocrats and immoral Frenchmen. I say, Peter, sorry
you've missed Miss Lydia Cathcart. You'd have loved her. She's gone back
to Golders Green and taken the body with her."

==> "Oh well," said Wimsey. "I don't suppose there was anything abstruse <==
about the body."

"No," said Parker, "the medical evidence was all right as far as it
went. He was shot through the lungs, and that's all."

hundred, though, Colonel."

"Nonsense, nonsense," said that veteran, in high good humour; "you play
an excellent game."

==> Mr. Murbles having withdrawn, Wimsey and Parker faced each other over <==
the remains of the breakfast.

"Peter," said the detective, "I don't know if I've done the right thing
by coming. If you feel----"

old Gerald didn't do it."

"I'm sure he didn't," agreed Parker.

==> "No, no," said Wimsey, "that isn't your line. Nothing rash about <==
you--nothing trustful. You are expected to throw cold water on my hopes
and doubt all my conclusions."

"Right ho!" said Parker. "Where would you like to begin?"

"No correspondence?"

"Not a line."

==> "No," said Wimsey, "he was the kind, I imagine, that didn't keep <==
letters. Much too good an instinct of self-preservation."

"Yes. I asked the servants about his letters, as a matter of fact. They
said he got a good number, but never left them about. They couldn't tell
me much about the ones he wrote, because all the outgoing letters are

was going to bring that sort of accusation against his sister's fiancé
he'd want _some_ evidence of a method in his madness, wouldn't he? Or
was he one of those Roman brothers who say simply: 'As the head of the
family I forbid the banns and that's enough'?"

==> "Gerald," said Wimsey, "is a good, clean, decent, thoroughbred public <==
schoolboy, and a shocking ass. But I don't think he's so mediæval as
that."

"But if he has the letter, why not produce it?"

"That's an idea," he said. "There were occasions--mild ones, but Helen
would make the most of them." He whistled thoughtfully. "Still, when it
comes to the gallows----"

==> "Do you suppose, Wimsey, that your brother really contemplates the <==
gallows?" asked Parker.

"I think Murbles put it to him pretty straight," said Lord Peter.

"Quite so. But does he actually realise--imaginatively--that it is

"H'm! Well, we'll follow them later. Now where did they come from?"

Together the two friends followed the path away from the house. The
gravel, except for the little patch before the conservatory, was old and
hard, and afforded but little trace, particularly as the last few days
==> had been rainy. Parker, however, was able to assure Wimsey that there <==
had been definite traces of dragging and bloodstains.

"What sort of bloodstains? Smears?"

"Yes, smears mostly. There were pebbles displaced, too, all the way--and

stain.

"That's where they found the handkerchief and revolver," said Parker. "I
looked for finger-marks, but the rain and mud had messed everything up."

==> Wimsey took out his lens, lay down, and conducted a personal tour of the <==
whole space slowly on his stomach, Parker moving mutely after him.

"He paced up and down for some time," said Lord Peter. "He wasn't
smoking. He was turning something over in his mind, or waiting for
somebody. What's this? Aha! Here's our No. 10 foot again, coming in

the garden at 3 a.m.?"

"Well," said Parker, "suppose we begin by tracing where No. 10 came
from."

==> "Hi, hi!" cried Wimsey, as they returned to the trail. "Here's <==
something--here's real treasure-trove, Parker!"

From amid the mud and the fallen leaves he retrieved a tiny, glittering
object--a flash of white and green between his finger-tips.

to the neighbourhood, or had reconnoitred previously."

"Arising out of that reply," said Parker, "I will now relate to you the
entertaining 'gossip' I have had with Mrs. Hardraw."

==> "Humph!" said Wimsey at the end of it. "That's interesting. We'd better <==
make inquiries at Riddlesdale and King's Fenton. Meanwhile we know where
No. 10 came from; now where did he go after leaving Cathcart's body by
the well?"

"The footsteps went into the preserve," said Parker. "I lost them there.

They crossed the drive, passed the cottage, and then, leaving the road,
followed the paling across some open grass fields. It was not long
before they found what they sought. From one of the iron spikes above
them dangled forlornly a strip of material. With Parker's assistance
==> Wimsey scrambled up in a state of almost lyric excitement. <==

"Here we are," he cried. "The belt of a Burberry! No sort of precaution
here. Here are the toe-prints of a fellow sprinting for his life. He
tore off his Burberry! he made desperate leaps--one, two, three--at the
palings. At the third leap he hooked it on to the spikes. He scrambled

"I'm really worried about her," said the Duchess. "She is giving way to
her nerves in the strangest manner. It is so unlike her. She will hardly
let anybody come near her. I have sent for Dr. Thorpe again."

"Don't you think she'd be better if she got up an' came downstairs a
==> bit?" suggested Wimsey. "Gets broodin' about things all by herself, I <==
shouldn't wonder. Wants a bit of Freddy's intellectual conversation to
cheer her up."

"You forget; poor girl," said the Duchess, "she was engaged to Captain
Cathcart. Everybody isn't as callous as you are."

Cathcart. Everybody isn't as callous as you are."

"Any more letters, your grace?" asked the footman, appearing with the
post-bag.

==> "Oh, are you going down now?" said Wimsey. "Yes, here you are--and <==
there's one other, if you don't mind waitin' a minute while I write it.
Wish I could write at the rate people do on the cinema," he added,
scribbling rapidly as he spoke. "'DEAR LILIAN,--Your father has killed
Mr. William Snooks, and unless you send me £1,000 by bearer, I shall
disclose all to your husband.--Sincerely, EARL OF DIGGLESBRAKE.' That's

should turn the skirt inside-out, I should see that the stain went right
through, and I should take my scissors" (Mr. Bunter produced a small,
sharp pair) "and snip off a tiny bit of the inside edge of the seam,
like this" (he did so) "and pop it into a little pill-box, so" (the
pill-box appeared magically from an inner pocket), "and seal it up both

the date. Then I should send it straight off to the analytical gentleman
in London, and he'd look through his microscope, and tell me right off
that it was rabbit's blood, maybe, and how many days it had been there,
and that would be the end of that," finished Mr. Bunter triumphantly,
replacing his nail-scissors and thoughtlessly pocketing the pill-box

The Police Superintendent at Ripley received Lord Peter at first
frigidly, and later, when he found out who he was, with a mixture of the
official attitude to private detectives and the official attitude to a
Duke's son.

==> "I've come to you," said Wimsey, "because you can do this combin'-out <==
business a sight better'n an amateur like myself. I suppose your fine
organisation's hard at work already, what?"

"Naturally," said the Superintendent, "but it's not altogether easy to
trace a motor-cycle without knowing the number. Look at the Bournemouth

"Of course, if he'd been seen going through Ripley _without_ a
number-plate he'd have been noticed and stopped, whereas with Mr.
Foulis's he was as safe as--as the Bank of England," he concluded in a
burst of originality.

==> "Obviously," said Wimsey. "Very agitatin' for the parson, poor chap. So <==
early in the mornin', too. I suppose it was just taken to be a practical
joke?"

"Just that," agreed the Superintendent, "but, after hearing what you
have to tell us, we shall use our best efforts to get the man. I expect

is the handsomest man in England, and no woman will ever care twopence

celebrated for his rhetoric and his suave but pitiless dissection of
hostile witnesses. The breeding of canaries was his unexpected hobby,
and besides their song he could appreciate no music but revue airs. He

controlled voice. Tragic irony, cutting contempt, or a savage

The Duchess had gone to bed, and the two men were alone in the library.
Peter, scrupulously in evening dress, had been valeted by Bunter, and
had been more than usually rambling and cheerful all evening. He now
took a cigar, retired to the largest chair, and effaced himself in a
complete silence.

Sir Impey Biggs walked up and down for some half-hour, smoking. Then he
came across with determination, brutally switched on a reading-lamp
right into Peter's face, sat down opposite to him, and said:

==> "Now, Wimsey, I want to know all you know." <==

"Do you, though?" said Peter. He got up, disconnected the reading-lamp,
and carried it away to a side-table.

"No bullying of the witness, though," he added, and grinned.

omitting only the matter of the suit-case and Bunter's information
obtained from Ellen.

Sir Impey Biggs listened with what Peter irritably described as a
cross-examining countenance, putting a sharp question every now and

his note-book thoughtfully.

"I think we can make a case out of this," he said, "even if the police
don't find your mysterious man. Denver's silence is an awkward
complication, of course." He hooded his eyes for a moment. "Did you say

"Certainly."

"Just as you like, of course, but my hands are rather tied already. Has
it ever occurred to you that perhaps he'd better not be found?"

disarm him.

"Remember this," said the latter earnestly, "that if once the police get
hold of a thing or a person it's no use relying on my, or Murble's, or
anybody's professional discretion. Everything's raked out into the light

business of theirs what I was doing in the garden.' Now I ask you,
==> Wimsey, is that a reasonable attitude for a man in Denver's position to <==
take up?"

Peter muttered something about "Never had any sense."

"Had anybody told Denver about this other man?"

little. "Why is Denver screening him?"

Sir Impey Biggs was accustomed to boast that no witness could perjure
himself in his presence undetected. As he put the question, he released
the other's eyes from his, and glanced down with finest cunning at
==> Wimsey's long, flexible mouth and nervous hands. When he glanced up <==
again a second later he met the eyes passing, guarded and inscrutable,
through all the changes expressive of surprised enlightenment; but by
that time it was too late; he had seen a little line at the corner of
the mouth fade out, and the fingers relax ever so slightly. The first
movement had been one of relief.

"B'Jove!" said Peter, "I never thought of that. What sleuths you lawyers
are. If that's so, I'd better be careful, hadn't I? Always was a bit
rash. My mother says----"

==> "You're a clever devil, Wimsey," said the barrister. "I may be wrong, <==
then. Find your man by all means. There's just one other thing I'd like
to ask. Whom are _you_ screening?"

"Look here, Biggs," said Wimsey, "you're not paid to ask that kind of

His sister was at his elbow. He had not heard her come, but she stood
there in her dressing-gown, her hands clutched together on her breast.
Her blue eyes were dilated till they looked almost black, and her skin
==> seemed nearly the colour of her ash-blonde hair. Wimsey stared at her <==
over the sheet he held in his arms, and the terror in her face passed
over into his, stamping them suddenly with the mysterious likeness of
blood-relationship.

Peter's own impression was that he stared "like a stuck pig" for about a

stout white posts at regular intervals, and presently with hurdles. The
reason for this was apparent as one came to the bottom of the valley,
for only a few yards on the left began the stretch of rough, reedy
tussocks, with slobbering black bog between them, in which anything
heavier than a water-wagtail would speedily suffer change into a
==> succession of little bubbles. Wimsey stooped for an empty sardine tin <==
which lay, horribly battered, at his feet, and slung it idly into the
quag. It struck the surface with a noise like a wet kiss, and vanished
instantly. With that instinct which prompts one, when depressed, to
wallow in every circumstance of gloom, Peter leaned sadly upon the
hurdles and abandoned himself to a variety of shallow considerations

Birth-control; and (7) The fallacy of free-will. This was his nadir,
however. Realising that his feet were cold and his stomach empty, and
that he had still some miles to go, he crossed the stream on a row of
slippery stepping-stones and approached the gate of the farm, which was
not an ordinary five-barred one, but solid and uncompromising. A man was
==> leaning over it, sucking a straw. He made no attempt to move at Wimsey's <==
approach. "Good evening," said that nobleman in a sprightly manner,
laying his hand on the catch. "Chilly, ain't it?"

The man made no reply, but leaned more heavily, and breathed. He wore a
rough coat and breeches, and his leggings were covered with manure.

Peter's palm, at any rate he moved a trifle back from the gate.

"Thanks awfully, old bean," said Peter, stepping briskly past him. "I
take it I shall find Mr. Grimethorpe in the house?"

the flagged path, then he hailed him, but without turning round.

"Mester!"

"Yes, old thing?" said Peter affably, returning.

her there. She stood defensively, blocking the threshold, till the same
voice growled impatiently:

"Well, who is it?"

==> "Good evening," said Wimsey, removing his hat. "I hope you'll excuse me <==
dropping in like this. I'm livin' at Riddlesdale Lodge."

"What of it?" demanded the voice. Above the child's head Wimsey saw the
outline of a big, thick-set man smoking in the inglenook of an immense
fireplace. There was no light but the firelight, for the window was

"What if I am?" retorted the farmer. "_I've_ no call to be ashamed o' my

"Rather not," said Lord Peter, "nor of your farm. Delightful place,

"What the hell's that to you?" growled the farmer, rounding on him with

before-mentioned.

"Oh, nothin'," he replied, "only I thought that charmin' little girl
might be yours."

"And if I thought she weren't," said Mr. Grimethorpe, "I'd strangle the
bitch and her mother together. What hast got to say to that?"

As a matter of fact, the remark, considered as a conversational formula,

suffered a severe check. He fell back, however, on the usual resource of
the male, and offered Mr. Grimethorpe a cigar, thinking to himself as he
did so:

"What a hell of a life the woman must lead."

did so:

"What a hell of a life the woman must lead."

==> The farmer declined the cigar with a single word, and was silent. Wimsey <==
lit a cigarette for himself and became meditative, watching his
companion. He was a man of about forty-five, apparently, rough, harsh,
and weather-beaten, with great ridgy shoulders and short, thick
thighs--a bull-terrier with a bad temper. Deciding that delicate hints
would be wasted on such an organism, Wimsey adopted a franker method.

straight brows, a wide, passionate mouth--a shape so wonderful that even
in that strenuous moment sixteen generations of feudal privilege stirred
in Lord Peter's blood. His hands closed over hers instinctively, but she
pulled herself hurriedly away and shrank back.

A thousand questions surged up in his mind, but before he could frame
them a long yell, and another, and then another came from the back of
the house.

Peter waited till the door had closed upon Mr. and Mrs. Grimethorpe;

cautiously to the man, who slipped through the gate and came slowly down
to him.

afraid I've done unintentional mischief."

The man looked at the money and at him.

found her footprints. Was she in league with the blackmailer? That was
an unpleasant thought. Was she endeavouring to help her fiancé? She had
an allowance of her own--a generous one, as Parker knew from the

fired that shot at close quarters? Once again--_whose was the green-eyed
cat_?

Surmises and surmises, each uglier than the last, thronged into Parker's
==> mind. He took up a photograph of Cathcart with which Wimsey had supplied <==
him, and looked at it long and curiously. It was a dark, handsome face;
the hair was black, with a slight wave, the nose large and well shaped,
the big, dark eyes at once pleasing and arrogant. The mouth was good,
though a little thick, with a hint of sensuality in its close curves;
the chin showed a cleft. Frankly, Parker confessed to himself, it did

Coincidences usually have the air of being practical jokes on the part
of Providence. Mr. Parker was shortly to be favoured--if the term is a

Parker had made his way from modest beginnings to a respectable
appointment in the C.I.D. rather by a combination of hard work,
shrewdness, and caution than by spectacular displays of happy guess-work
or any knack for taking fortune's tide at the flood. This time, however,
he was given a "leading" from above, and it was only part of the nature

cup of tea?"

Parker accepted the offer, and sank luxuriously into a corner of the
chesterfield. After the extraordinary discomfort of French furniture
there was solace in the enervating springiness beneath him, the cushions
==> behind his head, and Wimsey's excellent cigarettes. What Bunter had <==
meant by saying that things were "not quite straight yet" he could not
divine. A leaping wood fire was merrily reflected in the spotless
surface of the black baby grand; the mellow calf bindings of Lord

dramatic of poison trials--the Seddon Case. Gradually the mystery
gripped him, as it invariably did, and it was with a start of
astonishment that he looked up at a long and vigorous whirring of the
door-bell, to find that it was already long past midnight.

==> His first thought was that Wimsey must have left his latchkey behind, <==
and he was preparing a facetious greeting when the door opened--exactly
as in the beginning of a Sherlock Holmes story--to admit a tall and
beautiful young woman, in an extreme state of nervous agitation, with
halo of golden hair, violet-blue eyes, and disordered apparel all
complete; for as she threw back her heavy travelling-coat he observed

long. The delay has been due to the unfortunate illness of the porter
Morrison, whose evidence has been so material. But we are wasting no
time now."

"I'm sure I may leave it to you with every confidence, Sir Andrew,"
==> replied Wimsey, cordially shaking hands. "I'm diggin' away too; between <==
us we ought to get somethin'--you in your small corner and I in mine, as
the hymn says--or is it a hymn? I remember readin' it in a book about
missionaries when I was small. Did you want to be a missionary in your
youth? I did. I think most kids do some time or another, which is odd,
seein' how unsatisfactory most of us turn out."

"Thanks very much," replied Sir Andrew. "I hope you feel that all is
going well. I had Parker in here this morning to report, and he seemed a
little dissatisfied."

==> "He's been doing a lot of ungrateful routine work," said Wimsey, "and <==
being altogether the fine, sound man he always is. He's been a damn good
friend to me, Sir Andrew, and it's a real privilege to be allowed to
work with him. Well, so long, Chief."

He found that his interview with Sir Andrew Mackenzie had taken up a

cheerful young woman with bobbed red hair, dressed in a short checked
skirt, brilliant jumper, corduroy jacket, and a rakish green velvet
tam-o'-shanter.

"Surely," said the young woman, extending a shapely, ungloved hand,
==> "it's Lord Peter Wimsey. How're you? And how's Mary?" <==

"B'Jove!" said Wimsey gallantly, "it's Miss Tarrant. How perfectly
rippin' to see you again. Absolutely delightful. Thanks, Mary ain't as
fit as she might be--worryin' about this murder business, y'know. You've

institutions planned by unworldly people. Exactly why it made Lord Peter
instantly think of mission teas he could not say, unless it was that all
the members looked as though they cherished a purpose in life, and that
the staff seemed rather sketchily trained and strongly in evidence.
==> Wimsey reminded himself that in so democratic an institution one could <==
hardly expect the assistants to assume that air of superiority which
marks the servants in a West End club. For one thing, they would not be
such capitalists. In the dining-room below the resemblance to a mission
tea was increased by the exceedingly heated atmosphere, the babel of
conversation, and the curious inequalities of the cutlery. Miss Tarrant

"_Please_ don't shout about it," said Miss Tarrant, leaning across till
her auburn mop positively tickled his eyebrows. "It's _so_ secret."

==> "I'm awfully sorry," said Wimsey apologetically. "I say, d'you know <==
you're dipping those jolly little beads of yours in the soup?"

"Oh, am I?" cried Miss Tarrant, withdrawing hastily. "Oh, thank you so
much. Especially as the colour runs. I hope it isn't arsenic or
anything." Then, leaning forward again, she whispered hoarsely:

anything." Then, leaning forward again, she whispered hoarsely:

"The girl next me is Erica Heath-Warburton--the writer, you know."

==> Wimsey looked with a new respect at the lady in the Russian blouse. Few <==
books were capable of calling up a blush to his cheek, but he remembered
that one of Miss Heath-Warburton's had done it. The authoress was just
saying impressively to her companion:

"The D. H. Lawrence formula," said the other.

"Or even Dada," said the authoress.

"We need a new notation," said the curly-haired man, putting both elbows
==> on the table and knocking Wimsey's bread on to the floor. "Have you <==
heard Robert Snoates recite his own verse to the tom-tom and the penny
whistle?"

Lord Peter with difficulty detached his attention from this fascinating
discussion to find that Miss Tarrant was saying something about Mary.

"One misses your sister very much," she said. "Her wonderful enthusiasm.
She spoke so well at meetings. She had such a _real_ sympathy with the
worker."

==> "It seems astonishing to me," said Wimsey, "seeing Mary's never had to <==
do a stroke of work in her life."

"Oh," cried Miss Tarrant, "but she _did_ work. She worked for us.
Wonderfully! She was secretary to our Propaganda Society for nearly six
months. And then she worked so hard for Mr. Goyles. To say nothing of

"Another instance of the absurd, old-fashioned tyranny of parents," said
Miss Tarrant warmly. "You wouldn't think it could still be possible--in
post-war times."

==> "I don't know," said Wimsey, "that you could exactly call it that. Not <==
parents exactly. My mother's a remarkable woman. I don't think she
interfered. Fact, I fancy she wanted to ask Mr. Goyles to Denver. But my
brother put his foot down."

"Oh well, what can you expect?" said Miss Tarrant scornfully. "But I

brother put his foot down."

"Oh well, what can you expect?" said Miss Tarrant scornfully. "But I
don't see what business it was of his."

==> "Oh, none," agreed Wimsey. "Only, owin' to my late father's <==
circumscribed ideas of what was owin' to women, my brother has the
handlin' of Mary's money till she marries with his consent. I don't say
it's a good plan--I think it's a rotten plan. But there it is."

"Monstrous!" said Miss Tarrant, shaking her head so angrily that she

Finding nothing, he retreated into the lounge. Miss Tarrant uttered an
exclamation of pleasure.

"Why, there _is_ Mr. Goyles," she cried.

==> Wimsey glanced across, and at the sight of the tall, slightly stooping <==
figure with the untidy fair hair and the gloved right hand he gave an
irrepressible little gasp.

"Won't you introduce me?" he said.

irrepressible little gasp.

"Won't you introduce me?" he said.

"I'll fetch him," said Miss Tarrant. She made off across the lounge and
==> addressed the young agitator, who started, looked across at Wimsey, <==
shook his head, appeared to apologise, gave a hurried glance at his
watch, and darted out by the entrance. Wimsey sprang forward in pursuit.

"Extraordinary," cried Miss Tarrant, with a blank face. "He says he has
an appointment--but he can't surely be missing the----"

an appointment--but he can't surely be missing the----"

"Excuse me," said Peter. He dashed out, in time to perceive a dark
figure retreating across the street. He gave chase. The man took to his
heels, and seemed to plunge into the dark little alley which leads into
==> the Charing Cross Road. Hurrying in pursuit, Wimsey was almost blinded <==
by a sudden flash and smoke nearly in his face. A crashing blow on the
left shoulder and a deafening report whirled his surroundings away. He
staggered violently, and collapsed on to a second-hand brass bedstead.

The telephone bell rang, and Parker went to the instrument. A voice came
thinly over the wire:

"Is that 110A Piccadilly? This is Charing Cross Hospital. A man was

shoulder, and struck his head in falling. He has only just recovered
consciousness. He was brought in at 9.15. No, he will probably do very
well now. Yes, come round by all means."

"Peter has been shot," said Parker. "Will you come round with me to

said his lordship. "Tell 'em he's to be detained in connection with the
Riddlesdale case. That's good enough for them." It was now eleven, and
Mr. Parker had returned, gloomy and hungry, and was consuming a belated
omelette and a glass of claret.

==> Lady Mary Wimsey was hunched up in the window-seat. Her bobbed golden <==
hair made a little blur of light about her in the pale autumn sunshine.
She had made an attempt to breakfast early, and now sat gazing out into
Piccadilly. Her first appearance that morning had been made in Lord
Peter's dressing-gown, but she now wore a serge skirt and jade-green
jumper, which had been brought to town for her by the fourth member of

feel he might have something to do with it."

"Yes," said Peter, with a grin, "you always did find him a bit
sickenin', didn't you?"

==> "How can you, Wimsey?" growled Parker reproachfully, with his eyes on <==
Mary's face.

"Never mind him," said the girl. "If you can't be a gentleman,
Peter----"

potted me, and bunked. Silly-ass thing to do. I knew who he was. He
couldn't help gettin' caught."

"Peter----" said Mary in a ghastly voice.

==> "Look here, Polly," said Wimsey. "I did think of you. Honest injun, I <==
did. I haven't had the man arrested. I've made no charge at all--have I,
Parker? What did you tell 'em to do when you were down at the Yard this
morning?"

"To detain Goyles pending inquiries, because he was wanted as a witness

why tell all those lies to screen him? It won't do, Mary. You know he
was there--and you think he is guilty."

"No!"

==> "Yes," said Wimsey, grasping her with his sound hand as she shrank away. <==
"Mary, have you thought what you are doing? You are perjuring yourself
and putting Gerald in peril of his life, in order to shield from justice
a man whom you suspect of murdering your lover and who has most
certainly tried to murder me."

"Oh yes. He said Denis was no great catch--I do wish Gerald wasn't so
vulgar, in that flat, early-Victorian way--but he said that, after
George, he could only thank his stars it wasn't worse."

==> "Make a note of that, Charles," said Wimsey. <==

"Well, it seemed all right at first, but, as things went on, I got more
and more depressed. Do you know, there was something a little alarming
about Denis. He was so extraordinarily reserved. I know I wanted to be
left alone, but--well, it was uncanny! He was correct. Even when he went

observant little boy, dear."

"And still is," said Mary, smiling at Peter with surprising
friendliness.

==> "Old bad habits die hard," said Wimsey. "To proceed. At three o'clock <==
you went down to meet Goyles. Why did he come all the way up to the
house? It would have been safer to meet him in the lane."

"I knew I couldn't get out of the lodge-gate without waking Hardraw, and
so I'd have to get over the palings somewhere. I might have managed

"My dear," said the Duchess, "it seems to me that Mr. Goyles shows no
especial contempt for his own life. You must try to look at the thing
fairly. Shooting people and running away is not very heroic--according
to _our_ standards."

==> "The thing I don't understand," struck in Wimsey hurriedly, "is how <==
Gerald's revolver got into the shrubbery."

"The thing I should like to know about," said the Duchess, "is, was
Denis really a card-sharper?"

Mr. Goyles was interviewed the next day at the police-station. Mr.
Murbles was present, and Mary insisted on coming. The young man began by
blustering a little, but the solicitor's dry manner made its impression.

==> "Lord Peter Wimsey identifies you," said Mr. Murbles, "as the man who <==
made a murderous attack upon him last night. With remarkable generosity,
he has forborne to press the charge. Now we know further that you were
present at Riddlesdale Lodge on the night when Captain Cathcart was
shot. You will no doubt be called as a witness in the case. But you
would greatly assist justice by making a statement to us now. This is a

"Where were you at 11.50?"

"On the road from Northallerton. My meeting didn't finish till 10.45. I
can bring a hundred witnesses to prove it."

==> Wimsey made a note of the address where the meeting had been held, and <==
nodded to Goyles to proceed.

"I climbed over the wall and walked through the shrubbery."

"You saw no person, and no body?"

who burst in, still in wig and gown, and full of apology.

"Extremely sorry, Murbles," said Sir Impey. "We became excessively
tedious at the end, I regret to say. I really did my best, but dear old
Dowson is getting as deaf as a post, you know, and terribly fumbling in
==> his movements.--And how are you, Wimsey? You look as if you'd been in <==
the wars. Can we bring an action for assault against anybody?"

"Much better than that," put in Mr. Murbles; "attempted murder, if you
please."

"Excellent, excellent," said Sir Impey.

"Ah, but we've decided not to prosecute," said Mr. Murbles, shaking his
head.

==> "Really! Oh, my dear Wimsey, this will never do. Lawyers have to live, <==
you know. Your sister? I hadn't the pleasure of meeting you at
Riddlesdale, Lady Mary. I trust you are fully recovered."

"Entirely, thank you," said Mary with emphasis.

Riddlesdale, Lady Mary. I trust you are fully recovered."

"Entirely, thank you," said Mary with emphasis.

==> "Mr. Parker--of course your name is very familiar. Wimsey, here, can't <==
do a thing without you, I know. Murbles, are these gentlemen full of
valuable information? I am immensely interested in this case."

"Not just this moment, though," put in the solicitor.

"Well, well," said Mr. Murbles, beaming mildly, "let's make a start. I
fear, my dear young people, I am old-fashioned enough not to have
adopted the modern practice of cocktail-drinking."

==> "Quite right too," said Wimsey emphatically. "Ruins the palate and <==
spoils the digestion. Not an English custom--rank sacrilege in this old
Inn. Came from America--result, prohibition. That's what happens to
people who don't understand how to drink. God bless me, sir, why, you're
giving us the famous claret. It's a sin so much as to mention a cocktail
in its presence."

it?"

"Exactly so," said Biggs. "By the way, Denver still refuses to explain
his movements, I suppose?"

==> "Cat-e-gori-cally," replied the solicitor. "The Wimseys are a very <==
determined family," he added, "and I fear that, for the present, it is
useless to pursue that line of investigation. If we could discover the
truth in some other way, and confront the Duke with it, he might then be
persuaded to add his confirmation."

external sources. Secondly, we can examine the evidence afresh with a
view to finding the real murderer. And thirdly, the Paris police may
give us some light upon Cathcart's past history."

"And I fancy I know where to go next for information on the second
==> point," said Wimsey, suddenly. "Grider's Hole." <==

"Whew-w!" Parker whistled. "I was forgetting that. That's where that
bloodthirsty farmer fellow lives, isn't it, who set the dogs on you?"

"With the remarkable wife. Yes. See here, how does this strike you? This

time she must have seen my old cap and Burberry from the window and
mistaken me for Goyles, but, now I come to think of it, I told the kid
who came to the door that I was from Riddlesdale Lodge. If the child
told her mother, she must have thought it was Cathcart."

==> "No, no, Wimsey, that won't do," put in Parker; "she must have known <==
Cathcart was dead by that time."

"Oh, damn it! Yes, I suppose she must. Unless that surly old devil kept
the news from her. By Jove! that's just what he would do if he'd killed
Cathcart himself. He'd never say a word to her--and I don't suppose he

"You are suggesting, Lord Peter," said Mr. Murbles, in a tone calculated
to chill Peter's blithe impetuosity, "that, at the very time Mr.
Cathcart was betrothed to your sister, he was carrying on a disgraceful
intrigue with a married woman very much his social inferior."

==> "I beg your pardon, Polly," said Wimsey. <==

"It's all right," said Mary. "I--as a matter of fact, it wouldn't
surprise me frightfully. Denis was always!--I mean, he had rather
Continental ideas about marriage and that sort of thing. I don't think
he'd have thought that mattered very much. He'd probably have said there

surprise me frightfully. Denis was always!--I mean, he had rather
Continental ideas about marriage and that sort of thing. I don't think
he'd have thought that mattered very much. He'd probably have said there
was a time and place for everything."

==> "One of those watertight compartment minds," said Wimsey thoughtfully. <==
Mr. Parker, despite his long acquaintance with the seamy side of things
in London, had his brows set in a gloomy frown of as fierce a provincial
disapproval as ever came from Barrow-in-Furness.

"After all," said the solicitor, "Grimethorpe and the servant both admit
that he, Grimethorpe, was not at Grider's Hole on Wednesday night. If he
can't prove he was at Stapley he may have been at Riddlesdale."

==> "By Jove!" cried Wimsey; "driven off alone, stopped somewhere, left the <==
gee, sneaked back, met Cathcart, done him in, and toddled home next day
with a tale about machinery."

"Or he may even have been to Stapley," put in Parker; "left early or
gone late, and put in the murder on the way. We shall have to check the

precise times very carefully."

"I'd better stay here," said Parker. "There may be something from
Paris."

"Right you are. Let me know the minute anything comes through. I say,

"You'd better leave it to the police," said Denver. "I know you like
playin' at detectives, but I do think you might draw the line
somewhere."

==> "That's a nasty one," said Wimsey. "But I don't look on this as a game, <==
and I can't say I'll keep out of it, because I know I'm doin' valuable
work. Still, I can--honestly, I can--see your point of view. I'm jolly
sorry you find me such an irritatin' sort of person. I suppose it's hard
for you to believe I feel anything. But I do, and I'm goin' to get you

"And who mought tha be?" inquired Mr. Smith in a hostile manner.

death. They could only hang on desperately till help came--or till the
strain became too great. He could not even shout; it was almost more
than he could do to keep his mouth free of water. The dragging strain on

This reasoning seemed partly to convince Grimethorpe. He made way,
grumbling, and the two chilled and exhausted men were brought near the

I'll have to talk to him this morning--or to Mrs Grimethorpe. I'd take
my oath she could tell us something, what?"

"I should say there was very little doubt of it, my lord."

how to get at her. That jolly husband of hers seems to cherish the most
unpleasant suspicions of anything that comes this way in trousers. If he
found out we'd been talking to her, what you may call privately, he
might, as you say, be hurried by his feelin's into doin' something
regrettable."

Silly old blighter. Why couldn't he tell Murbles or me?"

Mr. Bunter advanced, the picture of respectful inquiry.

laughter. "O Lord! O Lord! Stuck into the window-frame for anybody to
find. _Just_ like Jerry. Signs his name to the business in letters a
foot long, leaves it conspicuously about, and then goes away and is
chivalrously silent."

jammed in the window-sash, was the dirty little bit of paper which,
discovered earlier, would have made the whole monstrous ceremonial
unnecessary.

the bed and laughed, with the tears streaming down his face.

Mr. Bunter was speechless. Speechlessly he produced a razor--and to the

through a stone-paved scullery, and across a yard, in time to see Mrs.
Grimethorpe emerging from a dark doorway opposite.

Framed there, the cold sunlight just lighting upon her still, dead-white
face and heavy, dark hair, she was more wonderful than ever. There was

"I am afraid I cannot help you. You are wasting time. If you cannot
produce your missing witness, why do you not set about finding the real
murderer? If you do so you surely need not trouble about this alibi.
Your brother's movements are his own business."

==> "I could wish," said Wimsey, "you had not taken up this attitude. <==
Believe me, I would have done all I could to spare you. I have been
working hard to find, as you say, the real murderer, but with no
success. The trial will probably take place at the end of the month."

Her lips twitched a little at that, but she said nothing.

She winced. "It is a lie. You cannot prove it. He will deny it. I shall

caricature of terror.

can--you must."

"Don't do that, Mrs. Grimethorpe. We might be seen. I am deeply sorry
for you, and, if I can get my brother out of this without bringing you
in, I promise you I will. But you see the difficulty. Why don't you
leave this man? He is openly brutal to you."

having to use your evidence. But if there should be no other way, I will
see that you have police protection from the moment that the subpoena is
served on you."

threshold. Grimethorpe was at the door, glowering in upon them.

admire such pluck and staunchness. You needn't be insulting. I know

Mr. Parker begged his friend's pardon for his unworthy suspicions, and
they sat a little time in silence. Parker sipped his port, and saw

out his pocket-book, and began idly turning over its contents, throwing
old letters into the fire, unfolding and refolding memoranda, and
reviewing a miscellaneous series of other people's visiting-cards. He

"I observe," said Parker, "that the paper is rather crumpled and dirty,

you have been keeping it in your pocket-book."

out! Holmes, how do you do it?"

"At one corner," pursued Parker, "I see two blots, one rather larger
than the other. I think someone must have shaken a pen there. Is there

and any of them in any manner whatsoever, and at last, triumphantly,
after reciting the names of the whole Grand Jury, came to the
presentation of the indictment with a sudden, brutal brevity.

"The Jurors for our Lord the King upon their oaths present that the most
==> noble and puissant prince Gerald Christian Wimsey, Viscount St. George, <==
Duke of Denver, a Peer of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Ireland, on the thirteenth day of October in the year of Our Lord one
thousand nine hundred and twenty-three in the Parish of Riddlesdale in
the County of Yorkshire did kill and murder Denis Cathcart."

Ireland, on the thirteenth day of October in the year of Our Lord one
thousand nine hundred and twenty-three in the Parish of Riddlesdale in
the County of Yorkshire did kill and murder Denis Cathcart."

"After which, Proclamation[6] was made by the Sergeant-at-Arms for the
==> Gentlemen Usher of the Black Rod to call in Gerald Christian Wimsey, <==
Viscount St. George, Duke of Denver, to appear at the Bar to answer his
indictment, who, being come to the Bar, kneeled until the Lord High
Steward acquainted him that he might rise."

The Duke of Denver looked very small and pink and lonely in his blue

hands." At which point the accused was observed to glance uneasily at
his solicitor. The exposition took only a short time, and Sir Wigmore
proceeded to call witnesses.

The prosecution being unable to call the Duke of Denver, the first
==> important witness was Lady Mary Wimsey. After telling about her <==
relations with the murdered man, and describing the quarrel, "At three
o'clock," she proceeded, "I got up and went downstairs."

"In consequence of what did you do so?" inquired Sir Wigmore, looking
round the Court with the air of a man about to produce his great effect.

innocence of any accused person as in the case of my noble client. But I
will explain to your lordships at once that I may be obliged to ask for
an adjournment, since we are at present without an important witness and
a decisive piece of evidence. My lords, I hold here in my hand a
cablegram from this witness--I will tell you his name; it is Lord Peter
==> Wimsey, the brother of the accused. It was handed in yesterday at New <==
York. I will read it to you. He says: 'Evidence secured. Leaving
to-night with Air Pilot Grant. Sworn copy and depositions follow by S.S.
_Lucarnia_ in case accident. Hope arrive Thursday.' My lords, at this
moment this all-important witness is cleaving the air high above the
wide Atlantic. In this wintry weather he is braving a peril which would

offices and clubs, where clerks and messenger-boys gloated over it and
laid wagers on the result; the thousands of monster printing-presses
sucked it in, boiled it into lead, champed it into slugs, engulfed it in
their huge maws, digested it to paper, and flapped it forth again with
clutching talons; and a blue-nosed, ragged veteran, who had once
==> assisted to dig Major Wimsey out of a shell-hole near Caudry, muttered: <==
"Gawd 'elp 'im, 'e's a real decent little blighter," as he tucked his
newspapers into the iron grille of a tree in Kingsway and displayed his
placard to the best advantage.

After a brief statement that he intended, not merely to prove his noble

lady. This proved a lengthy business, but the answer was finally in the
negative.

"I do not want there to be any doubt about this," said Sir Impey, "and,
with the learned Attorney-General's permission, I am now going to
==> confront this witness with Lady Mary Wimsey." <==

Lady Mary was accordingly placed before the witness, who replied
immediately and positively: "No, this is not the lady; I have never seen
this lady in my life. There is the resemblance of height and colour and
the hair bobbed, but there is nothing else at all--not the least in the

Grant shouted, but the words flipped feebly away into the blackness and

time the word "juice" shot into sound and fluttered away. But whether
the news was good or bad Lord Peter could not tell.

The lawyers whispered together in the window-seat.

"You see," said Sir Impey, "she has burnt her boats pretty well now by
coming at all. The great question for us is, Is it worth the risk? After
==> all, we don't know what Wimsey's evidence amounts to." <==

"No, that is why I feel inclined--in spite of the risk--to put this
evidence in," said Mr. Murbles.

"I am ready to take the risk," interposed Mrs. Grimethorpe starkly.

into his hand. Sir Impey read, coloured, glanced down the hall, put down
his brief, folded his hands over it, and said in a sudden, loud voice
which penetrated even to the deaf ear of the Duke of Wiltshire:

"My lords, I am happy to say that our missing witness is here. I call
==> Lord Peter Wimsey." <==

Every neck was at once craned, and every eye focused on the very grubby
and oily figure that came amiably trotting up the long room. Sir Impey
Biggs passed the note down to Mr. Murbles, and, turning to the witness,
who was yawning frightfully in the intervals of grinning at all his

who was yawning frightfully in the intervals of grinning at all his
acquaintances, demanded that he should be sworn.

The witness's story was as follows:

==> "I am Peter Death Bredon Wimsey, brother of the accused. I live at 110A <==
Piccadilly. In consequence of what I read on that bit of blotting-paper
which I now identify, I went to Paris to look for a certain lady. The
name of the lady is Mademoiselle Simone Vonderaa. I found she had left
Paris in company with a man named Van Humperdinck. I followed her, and
at length came up with her in New York. I asked her to give me the

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 17349    window = 17344 17354


to unravel.

"About eighteen months ago Cathcart, desperately searching for a secure
source of income, met the Duke of Denver, whose father had been a friend
of Cathcart's father many years before. The acquaintance prospered, and
==> Cathcart was introduced to Lady Mary Wimsey at that time (as she has <==
very frankly told us) 'at a loose end,' 'fed up,' and distressed by the
dismissal of her fiancé, Mr. Goyles. Lady Mary felt the need of an
establishment of her own, and accepted Denis Cathcart, with the proviso
that she should be considered a free agent, living her own life in her
own way, with the minimum of interference. As to Cathcart's object in

roof, and who is about to marry his sister, is nothing more nor less
than a card-sharper. And when Cathcart refuses to deny the charge--when
he, most insolently, as it seems, declares that he is no longer willing
to wed the noble lady to whom he is affianced--is it surprising that the
Duke should turn upon the impostor and forbid him ever to touch or speak
==> to Lady Mary Wimsey again? I say, my lords, that no man with a spark of <==
honourable feeling would have done otherwise. My client contents himself
with directing Cathcart to leave the house next day; and when Cathcart
rushes madly out into the storm he calls after him to return, and even
takes the trouble to direct the footman to leave open the conservatory
door for Cathcart's convenience. It is true that he called Cathcart a

him.

"But there is no need to labour this point--we _know_ that Captain
Cathcart was in the study at that time, for we have seen in evidence the
sheet of blotting-paper on which he blotted his letter to Simone
==> Vonderaa, and Lord Peter Wimsey has told us how he himself removed that <==
sheet from the study blotting-pad a few days after Cathcart's death.

"And let me here draw your attention to the significance of one point in
the evidence. The Duke of Denver has told us that he saw the revolver in
his drawer a short time before the fatal 13th, when he and Cathcart were

post-bag, till it was taken away and put in the post as a matter of
course, to be fetched back again, at enormous cost, delay, and risk of
life, two months later, in vindication of the great English motto:
'Business as usual.'

==> "Upstairs, Lady Mary Wimsey was packing her suit-case and writing a <==
farewell letter to her people. At length Cathcart signs his name; he
takes up the revolver and hurries out into the shrubbery. Still he paces
up and down, with what thoughts God alone knows--reviewing the past, no
doubt, racked with vain remorse, most of all, bitter against the woman
who has ruined him. He bethinks him of the little love-token, the

idea--escape from this horror of horrors--he dashes into the shrubbery,
just as, fatigued perhaps a little, but with a mind soothed by his
little expedition, the Duke of Denver comes briskly up the path, to meet
the eager bride over the body of her betrothed.

==> "My lords, the rest is clear. Lady Mary Wimsey, forced by a horrible <==
appearance of things into suspecting her lover of murder,
undertook--with what courage every man amongst you will realise--to
conceal that George Goyles ever was upon the scene. Of this
ill-considered action of hers came much mystery and perplexity. Yet, my
lords, while chivalry holds its own, not one amongst us will breathe one

over-sophisticated. He had abandoned his flat and his friends and fled
to the wilds of Corsica. For the last three months he had forsworn
letters, newspapers, and telegrams. He had tramped about the mountains,
admiring from a cautious distance the wild beauty of Corsican
peasant-women, and studying the vendetta in its natural haunt. In such
==> conditions murder seemed not only reasonable, but lovable. Bunter, his <==
confidential man and assistant sleuth, had nobly sacrificed his
civilised habits, had let his master go dirty and even unshaven, and had
turned his faithful camera from the recording of finger-prints to that
of craggy scenery. It had been very refreshing.

Now, however, the call of the blood was upon Lord Peter. They had
returned late last night in a vile train to Paris, and had picked up
their luggage. The autumn light, filtering through the curtains, touched
caressingly the silver-topped bottles on the dressing-table, outlined an
electric lamp-shade and the shape of the telephone. A noise of running

and was laying out scented soap, bath-salts, the huge bath-sponge, for
which there had been no scope in Corsica, and the delightful flesh-brush
with the long handle, which rasped you so agreeably all down the spine.
"Contrast," philosophised Lord Peter sleepily, "is life.
Corsica--Paris--then London.... Good morning, Bunter."

Lord Peter frowned over his letter.

"Nothing urgent, my lord. A sale next week at Northbury Hall--Mr.
Fleetwhite's library, my lord--a Caxton _Confessio Amantis_----"

"What's the good of tellin' me that when we're stuck up here for God

you'll excuse my mentioning it. I was one of seven."

"She always says, my lord, that facts are like cows. If you look them in

well trained to see it. He had, indeed, already begun to strop a razor.
Lord Peter suddenly bundled out of bed with a violent jerk and sped
across the landing to the bathroom.

Here he revived sufficiently to lift up his voice in "Come unto these

Ring the bell for Ellen. No, let go; go away! I don't want you, Peter!"

Peter hesitated, a little alarmed.

his ear. "Only produce hysterics," he added, as he drew his master
gently from the door. "Very distressing for both parties, and altogether
unproductive of results. Better to wait for the return of her grace, the
Dowager."

"Quite right," said Peter. He turned back to pick up his paraphernalia,
but was dexterously forestalled. Once again he lifted the lid of the
chest and looked in.

"Gravel, my lord, and silver sand."

"Silver sand."

A day or two later, in the gloom of a London afternoon, Mr. Charles
Parker rang the bell of a second-floor flat at No. 110A Piccadilly. The

Lord Peter had stepped out for a few minutes but was expecting him, and
would he kindly come in and wait.

"We only came up this morning," added the valet, "and are not quite
straight yet, sir, if you will excuse us. Would you feel inclined for a

Parker accepted the offer, and sank luxuriously into a corner of the
chesterfield. After the extraordinary discomfort of French furniture
there was solace in the enervating springiness beneath him, the cushions
==> behind his head, and Wimsey's excellent cigarettes. What Bunter had <==
meant by saying that things were "not quite straight yet" he could not
divine. A leaping wood fire was merrily reflected in the spotless
surface of the black baby grand; the mellow calf bindings of Lord
Peter's rare editions glowed softly against the black and primrose
walls; the vases were filled with tawny chrysanthemums; the latest

"I haven't come yet to the unpleasantest bit of the lot," said Peter.
"I've only just heard it, and it did give me a nasty jar, I'll admit.
Yesterday I got a letter from Lubbock saying he would like to see me, so
I trotted up here and dropped in on him this morning. You remember I

me? I had taken a squint at it myself, and didn't like the look of it,
so I sent it up to Lubbock, _ex abundantia cautelæ_; and I'm sorry to
say he confirms me. It's human blood, Charles, and I'm afraid it's
Cathcart's."

"No, no," said Parker. "Wimsey, don't think such ugly things as that."

"Hell!" cried Peter, exploding. "I'll have the truth of this beastly
business if we all go to the gallows together!"

==> At this moment Bunter entered with a telegram addressed to Wimsey. Lord <==
Peter read as follows:

           "Party traced London; seen Marylebone Friday. Further

"Good egg!" cried Wimsey. "Now we're gettin' down to it. Stay here,
there's a good man, in case anything turns up. I'll run round to the

bottle of the Chateau Yquem--it's rather decent. So long."

He leapt out of the flat, and a moment later his taxi buzzed away up
Piccadilly.

halo of golden hair, violet-blue eyes, and disordered apparel all
complete; for as she threw back her heavy travelling-coat he observed
that she wore evening dress, with light green silk stockings and heavy
brogue shoes thickly covered with mud.

==> "His lordship has not yet returned, my lady," said Mr. Bunter, "but Mr. <==
Parker is here waiting for him, and we are expecting him at any minute
now. Will your ladyship take anything?"

"No, no," said the vision hastily, "nothing, thanks. I'll wait. Good
evening, Mr. Parker. Where's Peter?"

Mr. Bunter was not far off. In fact, he was just outside the door with a

"Oh, quick!" cried Lady Mary.

Lord Peter appeared to read the message with great inward satisfaction,

that clue followed up without delay--or had any one of the three

been made, much less carried out, on a November day in the North Riding.
==> As it was, however, Lord Peter and Bunter left the trap at the foot of <==
the moor-path at ten minutes to four, and, dismissing Wilkes, climbed
steadily up to the wee hut on the edge of the fell.

With this the inquirers had to be content, and, presenting Groot with
half a crown, they emerged upon the moor at something after five
o'clock.

==> "Bunter," said Lord Peter through the dusk, "I am abso-bally-lutely <==
positive that the answer to all this business is at Grider's Hole."

"Very possibly, my lord."

Lord Peter extended his finger in a south-easterly direction. "That is

Lord Peter extended his finger in a south-easterly direction. "That is
Grider's Hole," he said. "Let's go."

"Very good, my lord."

==> So, like two Cockney innocents, Lord Peter and Bunter set forth at a <==
brisk pace down the narrow moor-track towards Grider's Hole, with never

through the November dusk from the wide loneliness of Whemmeling Fell.

It had come on them from behind, in a single stride, thick, cold,
choking--blotting each from the other, though they were only a yard or
two apart.

"Not at all, my lord."

"Don't move; go on speaking."

"Yes, my lord. It is unhappily somewhat damp."

"Somewhat--as you say," agreed his lordship, with a short laugh.

"If we go on going south-east," said his lordship, "we shall get to

"Couldn't we keep on going downhill, my lord?"

Lord Peter hesitated. Recollections of what he had heard and read surged

weakly.

"Well, we can't be much worse off than we are," said Lord Peter. "We'll
try it, and keep on shouting."

==> He grasped Bunter's hand, and they strode gingerly forward into the <==
thick coldness of the fog.

How long that nightmare lasted neither could have said. The world might
have died about them. Their own shouts terrified them; when they stopped
shouting the dead silence was more terrifying still. They stumbled over

"Of course." They remembered having heard horses scream like that. There
had been a burning stable near Poperinghe----

"Poor devil," said Peter. He started off impulsively in the direction of

"Come back, my lord," cried the man in a sudden agony. And then, with a

"I tripped right into it," said Wimsey's voice steadily, out of the
blackness. "One sinks very fast. You'd better not come near, or you'll
go too. We'll yell a bit. I don't think we can be very far from Grider's
Hole."

==> "If your lordship will keep shouting," returned Mr. Bunter, "I think--I <==
can--get to you," he panted, untying with his teeth the hard knot of a
coil of string.

"Oy!" cried Lord Peter obediently. "Help! Oy! Oy!"

"Oy!" cried Lord Peter obediently. "Help! Oy! Oy!"

==> Mr. Bunter groped towards the voice, feeling cautiously before him with <==
his walking-stick.

"Wish you'd keep away, Bunter," said Lord Peter peevishly. "Where's the
sense of both of us----?" He squelched and floundered again.

"I'm up to my thighs now," said Lord Peter.

soggy."

He felt the ground carefully, selected a tussocky bit which seemed
reasonably firm, and drove his stick well into it.

Burberry tightly about him, and, laying himself cautiously down upon his
belly, advanced, clue in hand, like a very Gothic Theseus of a late and
degenerate school.

The bog heaved horribly as he crawled over it, and slimy water squelched

support from them when he could.

"Call out again, my lord!"

==> "Here!" The voice was fainter and came from the right. Bunter had lost <==
his line a little, hunting for tussocks. "I daren't come faster," he
explained. He felt as though he had been crawling for years.

"Get out while there's time," said Peter. "I'm up to my waist. Lord!
this is rather a beastly way to peg out."

this is rather a beastly way to peg out."

==> "You won't peg out," grunted Bunter. His voice was suddenly quite close. <==
"Your hands now."

For a few agonising minutes two pairs of hands groped over the invisible
slime. Then:

"Your hands now."

For a few agonising minutes two pairs of hands groped over the invisible
slime. Then:

==> "Keep yours still," said Bunter. He made a slow, circling movement. It <==
was hard work keeping his face out of the mud. His hands slithered over
the slobbery surface--and suddenly closed on an arm.

"Thank God!" said Bunter. "Hang on here, my lord."

He felt forward. The arms were perilously close to the sucking mud. The
hands crawled clingingly up his arms and rested on his shoulders. He
grasped Wimsey beneath the armpits and heaved. The exertion drove his
own knees deep into the bog. He straightened himself hurriedly. Without

"You must go on shouting, my lord."

Wimsey shouted. His voice was breaking and fading.

"Don't mention it, my lord," said Bunter, with his mouth in the slime. A
thought struck him.

fallen across a stable tuft of grass. He pulled it over to him, and laid
it across his arms, so that he could just rest his chin upon it. The
relief to his neck was momentarily so enormous that his courage was
renewed. He felt he could hang on for ever.

More consultation.

"Aw reet. Jem's comin'."

A splattering noise marked the arrival of Jem with a hurdle. Then came
an endless wait. Then another hurdle, the string twitching, and the blur
of the lantern bobbing violently about. Then a third hurdle was flung

Presently he became aware that he was being carried upstairs and put to
bed. A big, old-fashioned room, with a fire on the hearth and a huge,

him. Another man appeared from time to time to help him. From below came
the bellowing sound of Grimethorpe's voice, blasphemously uplifted. Then
the harsh, brassy singing of the wry-shouldered man:

Lord Peter rolled into bed.

He drifted away into oblivion. The old song came up mockingly, and wound
its horrible fancies into his dreams:

Examining himself perfunctorily, he found a bruised and tender zone
beneath the armpits and round his chest and back, where the rescuing
rope had hauled at him. It was painful to move, so he lay back and
closed his eyes once more.

Grimethorpe that it would doubtless be to his pecuniary advantage to
treat your lordship with consideration."

"H'm. Nice, graspin' character, ain't he? Well, it's up and away for me.
==> O Lord! I _am_ stiff. I say, Bunter, have I any clothes to put on?" <==

"I have dried and brushed your lordship's suit to the best of my
ability, my lord. It is not as I should wish to see it, but I think your
lordship will be able to wear it to Riddlesdale."

"Well, I don't suppose the streets will be precisely crowded," retorted
his lordship. "I _do_ so want a hot bath. How about shavin' water?"

"I can procure that from the kitchen, my lord."

==> Bunter padded away, and Lord Peter, having pulled on a shirt and <==
trousers with many grunts and groans, roamed over to the window. As
usual with hardy country dwellers, it was tightly shut, and a thick
wedge of paper had been rammed in to keep the sash from rattling. He
removed this and flung up the sash. The wind rollicked in, laden with
peaty moor scents. He drank it in gladly. It was good to see the jolly

Pot. For a few minutes he stood there, returning thanks vaguely in his
mind for the benefits of existence. Then he withdrew to finish dressing.
The wad of paper was still in his hand, and he was about to fling it
into the fire, when a word caught his eye. He unrolled the paper. As he
read it his eyebrows went up and his mouth pursed itself into an
==> indescribable expression of whimsical enlightenment. Bunter, returning <==
with the hot water, found his master transfixed, the paper in one hand,
and his socks in the other, and whistling a complicated passage of Bach
under his breath.

and his socks in the other, and whistling a complicated passage of Bach

took the paper.

It was the missing letter from Tommy Freeborn.

Wimsey's adventure in the bog had unsettled his nerves. He sat down on
the bed and laughed, with the tears streaming down his face.

==> Mr. Bunter was speechless. Speechlessly he produced a razor--and to the <==
end of his days Wimsey never knew how or from whom he had so adequately
procured it--and began to strop it thoughtfully upon the palm of his
hand.

Presently Wimsey pulled himself together and staggered to the window for

with a whip, and they howled again. Suddenly he glanced up at the
window, with an expression of such livid hatred that Wimsey stepped

"Ah, Mr. Grimethorpe," exclaimed Wimsey cheerfully, "there you are.
Awfully pleased to see you and thank you, don'tcherknow, for puttin' me
up. I was just saying so to Mrs. Grimethorpe, an' asking her to say

ever so grateful to you both for all your kindness. Oh, and I say, could

"I'm just off," said Peter. "Good-bye again, Mrs. Grimethorpe, and a

and desperately confused in mind.

Grimethorpe's story was simple enough. She had suffered the torments of

harnessed the horse and driven in to Stapley.

Mr. Murbles waved his hands helplessly, but Sir Impey was rather amused.

earthly force."

The Coroner: "Did anybody else know the revolver was there?"

Duke of D.: "Fleming did, I think. I don't know of anybody else."

==> Detective-Inspector Parker of Scotland Yard, having only arrived on <==
Friday, had been unable as yet to make any very close investigation.
Certain indications led him to think that some person or persons had
been on the scene of the tragedy in addition to those who had taken part
in the discovery. He preferred to say nothing more at present.

some--er--unpleasant publicity. Er--I have always been a sincere
Christian myself, but I cannot feel that our religion demands that we
should make ourselves conspicuous--er--in such very painful
circumstances."

==> Mr. Parker reminded himself of a dictum of Lord Melbourne. <==

"Well, after all," said Mrs. Marchbanks, "as Helen so rightly says, does
it matter? Nobody's really got anything to be ashamed of. There has been
a stupid mistake, of course, but I don't see why anybody who wants to
shouldn't go to church."

"Of course," said Mrs. Pettigrew-Robinson, "he must speak out--for
everybody's sake. He must say what he was doing out of doors at that
time. Or, if he does not, it must be discovered. Dear me! That's what
these detectives are for, aren't they?"

nothing for a long time, and everybody jumped.

"There," said Mrs. Marchbanks, "I expect you'll clear it all up in no

"From whom?" inquired Mr. Pettigrew-Robinson.

"Her grace's brother-in-law."

amateur," she added.

"Not at all," said Parker. "Wimsey would be one of the finest detectives
in England if he wasn't lazy. Only we can't get hold of him."

"Mornin', dear old things," said the newcomer cheerfully. "How are you
all? Hullo, Helen! Colonel, you owe me half a crown since last September
year. Mornin', Mrs. Marchbanks, Mornin' Mrs. P. Well, Mr. Murbles, how
d'you like this bili--beastly weather? Don't trouble to get up, Freddy;
==> I'd simply hate to inconvenience you. Parker, old man, what a damned <==
reliable old bird you are! Always on the spot, like that patent ointment
thing. I say, have you all finished? I meant to get up earlier, but I
was snorin' so Bunter hadn't the heart to wake me. I nearly blew in last
night, only we didn't arrive till 2 a.m. and I thought you wouldn't half
bless me if I did. Eh, what, Colonel? Aeroplane. _Victoria_ from Paris

Corsica was perfectly amazin'--all black-eyed fellows with knives in
their belts and jolly fine-looking girls. Old Bunter had a regular
affair with the inn-keeper's daughter in one place. D'you know, he's an
awfully susceptible old beggar. You'd never think it, would you? Jove! I
am hungry. I say, Helen, I meant to get you some fetchin' crêpe-de-Chine
==> undies from Paris, but I saw that old Parker was gettin' ahead of me <==
over the bloodstains, so we packed up our things and buzzed off."

Mrs. Pettigrew-Robinson rose.

"Theodore," she said, "I think we ought to be getting ready for church."

one has so many more facilities. I'm sorry for poor old Polly, though.
How is she?"

"She must not be disturbed to-day," said the Duchess with decision.

==> "Not a bit of it," said Lord Peter; "she'll keep. To-day Parker and I <==
hold high revel. To-day he shows me all the bloody footprints--it's all
right, Helen, that's not swearin', that's an adjective of quality. I
hope they aren't all washed away, are they, old thing?"

"No," said Parker, "I've got most of them under flower-pots."

"Then pass the bread and squish," said Lord Peter, "and tell me all
about it."

The departure of the church-going element had induced a more

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 8551    window = 8546 8556



The departure of the church-going element had induced a more
humanitarian atmosphere. Mrs. Marchbanks stumped off upstairs to tell
Mary that Peter had come, and the Colonel lit a large cigar. The Hon.
Freddy rose, stretched himself, pulled a leather arm-chair to the
==> fireside, and sat down with his feet on the brass fender, while Parker <==
marched round and poured himself out another cup of coffee.

"I suppose you've seen the papers," he said.

"Oh yes, I read up the inquest," said Lord Peter. "Y'know, if you'll

behaved most improperly. He had no business to give such a summing-up.
With a jury of ignorant country fellows, what could one expect? And the
details that were allowed to come out! If I could have got here
earlier----"

==> "I'm afraid that was partly my fault, Wimsey," said Parker penitently. <==
"Craikes rather resents me. The Chief Constable at Stapley sent to us
over his head, and when the message came through I ran along to the
Chief and asked for the job, because I thought if there should be any
misconception or difficulty, you see, you'd just as soon I tackled it as
anybody else. I had a few little arrangements to make about a forgery

to Golders Green and taken the body with her."

"Oh well," said Wimsey. "I don't suppose there was anything abstruse
about the body."

==> "No," said Parker, "the medical evidence was all right as far as it <==
went. He was shot through the lungs, and that's all."

"Though, mind you," said the Hon. Freddy, "he didn't shoot himself. I
didn't say anything, not wishin' to upset old Denver's story, but, you
know, all that stuff about his bein' so upset and go-to-blazes in his

'Not a bit of it,' he said; 'it's a damn good world. I'm goin' to ask
Mary for a date to-morrow, an' then we'll go and live in Paris, where
they understand sex.' I said somethin' or other vague, and he went off
whistlin'."

==> Parker looked grave. Colonel Marchbanks cleared his throat. <==

"Well, well," he said, "there's no accounting for a man like Cathcart,
no accounting at all. Brought up in France, you know. Not at all like a
straightforward Englishman. Always up and down, up and down! Very sad,
poor fellow. Well, well, Peter, hope you and Mr. Parker will find out

"Nonsense, nonsense," said that veteran, in high good humour; "you play
an excellent game."

the remains of the breakfast.

by coming. If you feel----"

get to business. Of course, _I'm_ settin' off with the assumption that
old Gerald didn't do it."

"No, no," said Wimsey, "that isn't your line. Nothing rash about
you--nothing trustful. You are expected to throw cold water on my hopes
and doubt all my conclusions."

Peter considered. "I think we'll start from Cathcart's bedroom," he
said.

The bedroom was of moderate size, with a single window overlooking the
front door. The bed was on the right-hand side, the dressing-table
before the window. On the left was the fireplace, with an arm-chair
before it, and a small writing-table.

==> "Everything's as it was," said Parker. "Craikes had that much sense." <==

"Yes," said Lord Peter. "Very well. Gerald says that when he charged
Cathcart with bein' a scamp, Cathcart jumped up, nearly knockin' the
table over. That's the writin'-table, then, so Cathcart was sittin' in
the arm-chair. Yes, he was--and he pushed it back violently and rumpled

wasn't readin', because there's no book about, and we know that he
rushed straight out of the room and never came back. Very good. Was he
writin'? No; virgin sheet of blottin'-paper----"

==> "He might have been writing in pencil," suggested Parker. <==

"That's true, old Kill-Joy, so he might. Well, if he was he shoved the
paper into his pocket when Gerald came in, because it isn't here; but he
didn't, because it wasn't found on his body; so he wasn't writing."

been all over the grounds, you know, and at the smallest computation--if
we accept the shot heard by Hardraw at 11.50 as _the_ shot--there's an
hour and a half unaccounted for."

before bed, and cherish the ash with such scrupulous care. On the other
hand, if Freddy's right and Cathcart was feelin' unusually sleek and
pleased with life, that's just the sort of thing he would do."

"Do you think Mr. Arbuthnot would have invented all that, as a matter of
==> fact?" said Parker thoughtfully. "He doesn't strike me that way. He'd <==
have to be imaginative and spiteful to make it up, and I really don't
think he's either."

"I know," said Lord Peter. "I've known old Freddy all my life, and he
wouldn't hurt a fly. Besides, he simply hasn't the wits to make up any

wouldn't hurt a fly. Besides, he simply hasn't the wits to make up any
sort of a story. But what bothers me is that Gerald most certainly
hasn't the wits either to invent that Adelphi drama between him and
Cathcart."

Cathcart, he had an incentive to invent it. He would be trying to get
his head out of the--I mean, when anything important is at stake it's
wonderful how it sharpens one's wits. And the story being so far-fetched
does rather suggest an unpractised story-teller."

But it looks as though her taste in men had altered. I know my mother
said Cathcart had charm; that means he was attractive to women, I
suppose. No man can see what makes that in another man, but mother is
usually right. What's become of this fellow's papers?"

==> "He left very little here," replied Parker. "There's a cheque-book on <==
Cox's Charing Cross branch, but it's a new one and not very helpful.
Apparently he only kept a small current account with them for
convenience when he was in England. The cheques are mostly to self, with
an occasional hotel or tailor."

entirely empty. Well, I don't know that one can deduce anything from
that, exactly. I don't see any pencil about, by the way. I'm inclined to
think you're wrong in supposing that he was writing letters."

==> "I didn't suppose anything," said Parker mildly. "I daresay you're <==
right."

Lord Peter left the dressing-table, looked through the contents of the
wardrobe, and turned over the two or three books on the pedestal beside
the bed.

"No. Here's the window Gerald shouted out of. H'm! Nothing in the grate,
here, naturally--the fire's been lit since. I say, I wonder where Gerald
did put that letter to--Freeborn's, I mean."

==> "Nobody's been able to get a word out of him about it," said Parker. <==
"Old Mr. Murbles had a fearful time with him. The Duke insists simply
that he destroyed it. Mr. Murbles says that's absurd. So it is. If he
was going to bring that sort of accusation against his sister's fiancé
he'd want _some_ evidence of a method in his madness, wouldn't he? Or
was he one of those Roman brothers who say simply: 'As the head of the

"But if he has the letter, why not produce it?"

"Why, indeed? Letters from old college friends in Egypt aren't, as a
rule, compromising."

==> "You don't suppose," suggested Parker tentatively, "that this Mr. <==
Freeborn referred in his letter to any old--er--entanglement which your
brother wouldn't wish the Duchess to know about?"

Lord Peter paused, while absently examining a row of boots.

"That's an idea," he said. "There were occasions--mild ones, but Helen
would make the most of them." He whistled thoughtfully. "Still, when it
comes to the gallows----"

"Do you suppose, Wimsey, that your brother really contemplates the
==> gallows?" asked Parker. <==

"I think Murbles put it to him pretty straight," said Lord Peter.

"Quite so. But does he actually realise--imaginatively--that it is
possible to hang an English peer for murder on circumstantial evidence?"

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 8892    window = 8887 8897


Lord Peter considered this.

"Imagination isn't Gerald's strong point," he admitted. "I suppose they
_do_ hang peers? They can't be beheaded on Tower Hill or anything?"

==> "I'll look it up," said Parker; "but they certainly hanged Earl Ferrers <==
in 1760."

"Did they, though?" said Lord Peter. "Ah well, as the old pagan said of
the Gospels, after all, it was a long time ago, and we'll hope it wasn't
true."

afterwards. But that part of the treatment is obsolete."

"We'll tell Gerald about it," said Lord Peter, "and persuade him to take
the matter seriously. Which are the boots he wore Wednesday night?"

"We'll tell Gerald about it," said Lord Peter, "and persuade him to take

"Yes," said Lord Peter bitterly. "M'm! a good heavy lace-up boot--the
sort that sends the blood to the head."

"He wore leggings, too," said Parker; "these."

"Rather elaborate preparations for a stroll in the garden. But, as you
were just going to say, the night was wet. I must ask Helen if Gerald
ever suffered from insomnia."

"These damned flowers look jolly healthy," he said. "Do you mean you've
been letting the gardener swarm in here every day to water 'em?"

==> "Yes," said Parker apologetically, "I did. But he's had strict orders <==
only to walk on these mats."

"Good," said Lord Peter. "Take 'em up, then, and let's get to work."

With his lens to his eye he crawled cautiously over the floor.

With his lens to his eye he crawled cautiously over the floor.

body." (Parker had opened the outer door and lifted some matting, to
show a trampled patch of gravel, discoloured with blood.) "He kneels by

plants, and, beneath these, a damp and dismal bed of earth, occupied, in
a sprawling and lackadaisical fashion, by stringy cactus plants and a
sporadic growth of maidenhair fern, and masked by a row of large
chrysanthemums in pots.

==> "What've you got?" inquired Parker, seeing his friend peering into this <==
green retreat.

Lord Peter withdrew his long nose from between two pots and said: "Who
put what down here?"

Lord Peter withdrew his long nose from between two pots and said: "Who
put what down here?"

==> Parker hastened to the place. There, among the cacti, was certainly the <==
clear mark of some oblong object, with corners, that had been stood out
of sight on the earth behind the pots.

"It's a good thing Gerald's gardener ain't one of those conscientious
blighters that can't even let a cactus alone for the winter," said Lord

blighters that can't even let a cactus alone for the winter," said Lord
Peter, "or he'd've tenderly lifted these little drooping heads--oh! damn
and blast the beastly plant for a crimson porcupine! _You_ measure it."

==> Parker measured it. <==

"Two and a half feet by six inches," he said. "And fairly heavy, for
it's sunk in and broken the plants about. Was it a bar of anything?"

"I fancy not," said Lord Peter. "The impression is deeper on the farther

"I fancy not," said Lord Peter. "The impression is deeper on the farther
side. I think it was something bulky set up on edge, and leaned against
the glass. If you ask for my private opinion I should guess that it was
a suit-case."

==> "A suit-case!" exclaimed Parker. "Why a suit-case?" <==

"Why indeed? I think we may assume that it didn't stay here very long.
It would have been exceedingly visible in the daytime. But somebody
might very well have shoved it in here if they were caught with it--say
at three o'clock in the morning--and didn't want it to be seen."

would urge him to pop it down handy by the body? No. Unless Craikes or
the gardener has been leaving things about, it was thrust away there on
Wednesday night by Gerald, by Cathcart--or, I suppose, by Mary. Nobody
else could be supposed to have anything to hide."

==> "Yes," said Parker, "one person." <==

"Who's that?"

"The Person Unknown."

"The Person Unknown."

"Who's he?"

==> For answer Mr. Parker proudly stepped to a row of wooden frames, <==
carefully covered with matting. Stripping this away, with the air of a
bishop unveiling a memorial, he disclosed a V-shaped line of footprints.

"These," said Parker, "belong to nobody--to nobody I've ever seen or
heard of, I mean."

Perhaps not. There are no footmarks under the body? Can't say, it's such

in. Was he just going to throw Cathcart into the well? He hears a sound;
he starts; he turns; he runs on tiptoe--into the shrubbery, by Jove!"

==> "Yes," said Parker, "and the tracks come out on one of the grass paths <==
in the wood, and there's an end of them."

"H'm! Well, we'll follow them later. Now where did they come from?"

Together the two friends followed the path away from the house. The

Together the two friends followed the path away from the house. The
gravel, except for the little patch before the conservatory, was old and
hard, and afforded but little trace, particularly as the last few days

had been definite traces of dragging and bloodstains.

"What sort of bloodstains? Smears?"

"Yes, smears mostly. There were pebbles displaced, too, all the way--and

There was blood on the grass border between the path and the bed, and
the edge of the grass was broken and trampled.

"I don't like that," said Lord Peter.

==> "Ugly, isn't it?" agreed Parker. <==

"Poor devil!" said Peter. "He made a determined effort to hang on here.
That explains the blood by the conservatory door. But what kind of a
devil drags a corpse that isn't quite dead?"

yards or so they turned aside into the thicket. A large tree had fallen
at some time and made a little clearing, in the midst of which a
tarpaulin had been carefully spread out and pegged down. The air was
heavy with the smell of fungus and fallen leaves.

==> "Scene of the tragedy," said Parker briefly, rolling back the tarpaulin. <==

Lord Peter gazed down sadly. Muffled in an overcoat and a thick grey
scarf, he looked, with his long, narrow face, like a melancholy adjutant
stork. The writhing body of the fallen man had scraped up the dead
leaves and left a depression in the sodden ground. At one place the

leaves and left a depression in the sodden ground. At one place the
darker earth showed where a great pool of blood had soaked into it, and
the yellow leaves of a Spanish poplar were rusted with no autumnal
stain.

==> "That's where they found the handkerchief and revolver," said Parker. "I <==
looked for finger-marks, but the rain and mud had messed everything up."

Wimsey took out his lens, lay down, and conducted a personal tour of the
whole space slowly on his stomach, Parker moving mutely after him.

"Quite so. Why did he stand still to be shot at?"

this sleuth-hound business. If one could go on all-fours, or had eyes in

"There are many difficulties inherent in a teleological view of

"And here's where he got over," said Lord Peter, pointing to a place
where the _chevaux de frise_ on the top was broken away. "Here's the
dent where his heels came down, and here's where he fell forward on
hands and knees. Hum! Give us a back, old man, would you? Thanks. An old

fragment of Burberry behind him. What luck! Here's a deep, damp ditch on
the other side, which I shall now proceed to fall into."

A slithering crash proclaimed that he had carried out his intention.

were only a hundred yards or so from the gate, ran along and was let
out, decorously, by Hardraw, the gamekeeper, who happened to be coming

motor-bicyclists use, with a belt round it.

"Was he a gentleman?"

"Just so," said Lord Peter. "Hence we deduce No. 10's exceptional height
and strength."

exceptional shortness and weakness just now, isn't it?"

"Oh!" said Peter. "Well--well, as you so rightly say, that is a bit
unfortunate."

pair of patched 10's. "By the way, how did he make straight in the dark
for the place where the spikes were missing? Looks as though he belonged
to the neighbourhood, or had reconnoitred previously."

entertaining 'gossip' I have had with Mrs. Hardraw."

"Humph!" said Wimsey at the end of it. "That's interesting. We'd better
make inquiries at Riddlesdale and King's Fenton. Meanwhile we know where

==> "The footsteps went into the preserve," said Parker. "I lost them there. <==
There is a regular carpet of dead leaves and bracken."

"Well, but we needn't go through all that sleuth grind again," objected
his friend. "The fellow went in, and, as he presumably is not there

still, he came out again. He didn't come out through the gate or Hardraw
would have seen him; he didn't come out the same way he went in or he
would have left some traces. Therefore he came out elsewhere. Let's walk
round the wall."

==> "Then we'll turn to the left," said Parker, "since that's the side of <==
the preserve, and he apparently went through there."

"True, O King! and as this isn't a church, there's no harm in going
round it widdershins. Talking of church, there's Helen coming back. Get

They crossed the drive, passed the cottage, and then, leaving the road,
followed the paling across some open grass fields. It was not long
before they found what they sought. From one of the iron spikes above
==> them dangled forlornly a strip of material. With Parker's assistance <==
Wimsey scrambled up in a state of almost lyric excitement.

"Here we are," he cried. "The belt of a Burberry! No sort of precaution
here. Here are the toe-prints of a fellow sprinting for his life. He
tore off his Burberry! he made desperate leaps--one, two, three--at the

palings. At the third leap he hooked it on to the spikes. He scrambled
up, scoring long, scrabbling marks on the paling. He reached the top.
Oh, here's a bloodstain run into this crack. He tore his hands. He
dropped off. He wrenched the coat away, leaving the belt dangling----"

==> "I wish you'd drop off," grumbled Parker. "You're breaking my <==
collar-bone."

Lord Peter dropped off obediently, and stood there holding the belt
between his fingers. His narrow grey eyes wandered restlessly over the
field. Suddenly he seized Parker's arm and marched briskly in the

Close under the wall, and sunk heavily into the narrow and muddy lane

orders to look in at Riddlesdale on the way and inquire for a green-eyed
cat, also for a young man with a side-car. The Duchess was lying down.
Mrs. Pettigrew-Robinson had taken her husband for a brisk walk.
Upstairs, somewhere, Mrs. Marchbanks enjoyed a perfect communion of
thought with her husband.

Wednesday morning. The house was almost deserted, everybody having gone
to attend the police-court proceedings at Northallerton. The thing would
be purely formal, of course, but it seemed only proper that the family
should be fully represented. The Dowager Duchess, indeed, was there--she
had promptly hastened to her son's side and was living heroically in

heather was brown and wet, and the little streams had no colour in them.
It was six o'clock, but there was no sunset. Only a paleness had moved
behind the thick sky from east to west all day. Lord Peter, tramping
back after a long and fruitless search for tidings of the man with the
motor-cycle, voiced the dull suffering of his gregarious spirit. "I wish
==> old Parker was here," he muttered, and squelched down a sheep-track. <==

He was making, not directly for the Lodge, but for a farmhouse about two
and a half miles distant from it, known as Grider's Hole. It lay almost
due north of Riddlesdale village, a lonely outpost on the edge of the
moor, in a valley of fertile land between two wide swells of heather.

[line number in individual story] matching line = 3076    window = 3071 3081

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 10368    window = 10363 10373


The track wound down from the height called Whemmeling Fell, skirted a
vile swamp, and crossed the little River Ridd about half a mile before
reaching the farm. Peter had small hope of hearing any news at Grider's
Hole, but he was filled with a sullen determination to leave no stone
unturned. Privately, however, he felt convinced that the motor-cycle had
==> come by the high road, Parker's investigations notwithstanding, and <==
perhaps passed directly through King's Fenton without stopping or
attracting attention. Still, he had said he would search the
neighbourhood, and Grider's Hole was in the neighbourhood. He paused to
relight his pipe, then squelched steadily on. The path was marked with
stout white posts at regular intervals, and presently with hurdles. The

he might, with another conscience or constitution, have taken to Indian
hemp--for its exhilarating properties--at a moment when life seemed dust
and ashes, he had not primarily the detective temperament. He expected
next to nothing from inquiries at Grider's Hole, and, if he had, he
might probably have extracted all the information he wanted by a
==> judicious display of Treasury notes to the glum man at the gate. Parker <==
would in all likelihood have done so; he was paid to detect and to do
nothing else, and neither his natural gifts nor his education (at
Barrow-in-Furness Grammar School) prompted him to stray into side-tracks
at the beck of an ill-regulated imagination. But to Lord Peter the world
presented itself as an entertaining labyrinth of side-issues. He was a

==> Mr. Parker sat disconsolate in a small _appartement_ in the Rue St. <==
Honoré. It was three o'clock in the afternoon. Paris was full of a
subdued but cheerful autumn sunlight, but the room faced north, and was
depressing, with its plain, dark furniture and its deserted air. It was
a man's room, well appointed after the manner of a discreet club; a room
that kept its dead owner's counsel imperturbably. Two large saddlebag

large collection of books on history and international politics, various
French novels, a number of works on military and sporting subjects, and
a famous French edition of the _Decameron_ with the additional plates.
Under the window stood a large bureau.

==> Parker shook his head, took out a sheet of paper, and began to write a <==
report. He had breakfasted on coffee and rolls at seven; he had made an
exhaustive search of the flat; he had interviewed the concierge, the
manager of the Crédit Lyonnais, and the Prefect of Police for the
Quartier, and the result was very poor indeed.


[line number in individual story] matching line = 3522    window = 3517 3527

Cambridge, and had then travelled a good deal, visiting persons of
importance in various countries, and apparently studying with a view to
a diplomatic career. During the period from 1913 to 1918 the story told
by the books became intensely interesting, baffling, and depressing. At
the outbreak of war he had taken a commission in the 15th ---- shires.
==> With the help of the cheque-book, Parker reconstructed the whole <==
economic life of a young British officer--clothes, horses, equipment,
travelling, wine and dinners when on leave, bridge debts, rent of the
flat in the Rue St. Honoré, club subscriptions, and what not. This
outlay was strictly moderate and proportioned to his income. Receipted
bills, neatly docketed, occupied one drawer of the bureau, and a careful

[line number in individual story] matching line = 3544    window = 3539 3549

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 10836    window = 10831 10841


of the original amount, as the tide of war washed over the vineyards and
carried the workers away. For the first year or so there were
substantial dividends from capital invested in French _rentes_; then
came an ominous entry of 20,000 francs on the credit side of the
account, and, six months after, another of 30,000 francs. After that the
==> landslide followed fast. Parker could picture those curt notes from the <==
Front, directing the sale of Government securities, as the savings of
the past six years whirled away in the maelstrom of rising prices and
collapsing currencies. The dividends grew less and less and ceased;
then, more ominous still, came a series of debits representing the
charges on renewal of promissory notes.

[line number in individual story] matching line = 3554    window = 3549 3559

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 10846    window = 10841 10851


charges on renewal of promissory notes.

About 1918 the situation had become acute, and several entries showed a
desperate attempt to put matters straight by gambling in foreign
exchanges. There were purchases, through the bank, of German marks,
==> Russian roubles, and Roumanian lei. Mr. Parker sighed sympathetically, <==
when he saw this, thinking of £12 worth of these delusive specimens of
the engraver's art laid up in his own desk at home. He knew them to be
waste paper, yet his tidy mind could not bear the thought of destroying
them. Evidently Cathcart had found marks and roubles very broken reeds.


[line number in individual story] matching line = 3563    window = 3558 3568

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 10855    window = 10850 10860


them. Evidently Cathcart had found marks and roubles very broken reeds.

It was about this time that Cathcart's pass-book began to reveal the
paying in of various sums in cash, some large, some small, at irregular
dates and with no particular consistency. In December, 1919, there had
==> been one of these amounting to as much as 35,000 francs. Parker at first <==
supposed that these sums might represent dividends from some separate
securities which Cathcart was handling for himself without passing them
through the bank. He made a careful search of the room in the hope of
finding either the bonds themselves or at least some memorandum
concerning them, but the search was in vain, and he was forced to

and receipts presented a similar aspect and were more or less evenly
balanced, the cheques to self becoming rather larger and more frequent
as time went on, while during 1921 the income from the vineyard began to
show signs of recovery.

==> Mr. Parker noted down all this information in detail, and, leaning back <==
in his chair, looked round the flat. He felt, not for the first time,
distaste for his profession, which cut him off from the great masculine
community whose members take each other for granted and respect privacy.
He relighted his pipe, which had gone out, and proceeded with his
report.

notes, efforts would be made to trace them.

have got himself into the power of somebody who knew too much. It was
noteworthy that his mysterious receipts in cash began just as his
economies were exhausted; it seemed likely that they represented
irregular gains from gambling--in the casinos, on the exchange, or, if

==> Why had Lady Mary lied at the inquest? For that she had lied, Parker had <==
no manner of doubt. He disbelieved the whole story of the second shot
which had awakened her. What had brought her to the conservatory door at
three o'clock in the morning? Whose was the suit-case--if it was a
suit-case--that had lain concealed among the cactus plants? Why this
prolonged nervous breakdown, with no particular symptoms, which

prevented Lady Mary from giving evidence before the magistrate or
answering her brother's inquiries? Could Lady Mary have been present at
the interview in the shrubbery? If so, surely Wimsey and he would have
found her footprints. Was she in league with the blackmailer? That was
an unpleasant thought. Was she endeavouring to help her fiancé? She had
==> an allowance of her own--a generous one, as Parker knew from the <==
Duchess. Could she have tried to assist Cathcart with money? But in that
case, why not tell all she knew? The worst about Cathcart--always
supposing that card-sharping were the worst--was now matter of public
knowledge, and the man himself was dead. If she knew the truth, why did
she not come forward and save her brother?

blade that rain and sap had since restored to uprightness? Had Peter and
he found _all_ the footsteps in the wood? Had some more trusted hand
fired that shot at close quarters? Once again--_whose was the green-eyed
cat_?

==> Surmises and surmises, each uglier than the last, thronged into Parker's <==
mind. He took up a photograph of Cathcart with which Wimsey had supplied
him, and looked at it long and curiously. It was a dark, handsome face;
the hair was black, with a slight wave, the nose large and well shaped,
the big, dark eyes at once pleasing and arrogant. The mouth was good,
though a little thick, with a hint of sensuality in its close curves;

astonishingly expensive for its bulk. The young lady had been charmingly
sympathetic, and, without actually insinuating anything, had contrived
to make her customer feel just a little bit of a dog. He felt that his

nonchalantly over a gorgeous display of jewellery, as though hesitating
between a pearl necklace valued at 80,000 francs and a pendant of
diamonds and aquamarines set in platinum.

"But no, monsieur. If you desire to match your cat I recommend you to do

"Undoubtedly, monsieur, it is one of our cats. These little animals are

"If it was sold over the counter for cash it would be difficult, but if
it was entered in our books it might not be impossible to discover, if
monsieur desired it."

agent of the British police, and it is of great importance that I should
know to whom this cat originally belonged."

"In that case," said the young man, "I shall do better to inform
monsieur the proprietor."

than the beginning of the year, when these cats were made." He ran a
podgy finger down the pages of the ledger. "The first purchase was on
January 19th."

"That is all, monsieur. How many names have you there?"

"Thirteen," said Parker.

The search in the day-book was longer and more tiresome, but eventually
four cats were duly found to have been sold; one on January 31st,
another on February 6th, the third on May 17th, and the last on August
9th.

thanks, when a sudden association of ideas and dates prompted him to
hand Cathcart's photograph to Monsieur Briquet and ask whether he
recognised it.

Monsieur Briquet shook his head.

"We can see by the day-book," put in Monsieur Briquet, "on what occasion
a diamond comb was sold with a diamond cat."

They went back and turned to the January volume, where they found no
help. But on February 6th they read:

there was solace in the enervating springiness beneath him, the cushions
behind his head, and Wimsey's excellent cigarettes. What Bunter had
meant by saying that things were "not quite straight yet" he could not

Peter's rare editions glowed softly against the black and primrose
walls; the vases were filled with tawny chrysanthemums; the latest
editions of all the papers were on the table--as though the owner had
never been absent.

==> Over his tea Mr. Parker drew out the photographs of Lady Mary and Denis <==
Cathcart from his breast pocket. He stood them up against the teapot and
stared at them, looking from one to the other as if trying to force a
meaning from their faintly smirking, self-conscious gaze. He referred
again to his Paris notes, ticking off various points with a pencil.
"Damn!" said Mr. Parker, gazing at Lady Mary. "Damn--damn--damn----"

the speed limit--and the black moors were reeling by so fast. But now he
had really got the formula he wouldn't forget it again. The connection
was just there--close, thick, richly coherent.

to that phrase. Even now--No, now I come to think of it, my train of

round just in time to catch Mary stimulatin' the thermometer to terrific
leaps on the hot-water bottle."

==> "Well, I'm damned!" said Parker. <==

"So was Thorpe. All mother said was, that if he wasn't too old a bird
yet to be taken in by that hoary trick he'd no business to be gettin'
himself up as a grey-haired family practitioner. So then she asked the
girl about the sick fits--when they happened, and how often, and was it

bath salts and the Elliman's embrocation and the Kruschen feelings and
the toothbrushes and things, was the family bottle of
ipecacuanha--three-quarters empty! Mother said--well, I told you what
she said. By the way, how do you spell ipecacuanha?"

==> Mr. Parker spelt it. <==

"Damn you!" said Lord Peter. "I _did_ think I'd stumped you that time. I
believe you went and looked it up beforehand. _No_ decent-minded person
would know how to spell ipecacuanha out of his own head. Anyway, as you
were saying, it's easy to see which side of the family has the detective

of their way to invent subconsciousness and kleptomania, and complexes
and other fancy descriptions to explain away when people had done
naughty things, she thought one might just as well take advantage of the
fact."

==> "Wimsey," said Parker, much excited, "did she mean she suspected <==
something?"

"My dear old chap," replied Lord Peter, "whatever can be known about
Mary by putting two and two together my mother knows. I told her all
_we_ knew up to that point, and she took it all in, in her funny way,

it, and they'll never be able to think of a better explanation for
themselves.' Indeed, you know," said Peter, "I think if any of them
start getting inquisitive, they'll have mother down on them like a ton
of bricks."

==> "What do you really think yourself?" asked Parker. <==

"I haven't come yet to the unpleasantest bit of the lot," said Peter.
"I've only just heard it, and it did give me a nasty jar, I'll admit.
Yesterday I got a letter from Lubbock saying he would like to see me, so
I trotted up here and dropped in on him this morning. You remember I

amateurish effort to tidy it up herself with soap. So I think we may
conclude that Mary knew the stains were there, and wanted to avoid
discovery. She told Ellen that the blood was from a grouse--which must
have been a deliberate untruth."

==> "Perhaps," said Parker, struggling against hope to make out a case for <==
Lady Mary, "she only said, 'Oh! one of the birds must have bled,' or
something like that."

"I don't believe," said Peter, "that one could get a great patch of
human blood on one's clothes like that and not know what it was. She

"I don't believe," said Peter, "that one could get a great patch of

must have knelt right in it. It was three or four inches across."

"Well, now," went on Peter, "on Wednesday night everybody comes in and
dines and goes to bed except Cathcart, who rushes out and stays out. At
11.50 the gamekeeper, Hardraw, hears a shot which may very well have
been fired in the clearing where the--well, let's say the accident--took

enough to waken a healthy young sleeper next door? And, in any case,
_if_ that was the shot that killed Cathcart, he can barely have been
dead when my brother found him--and again, in that case, how was there
time for him to be carried up from the shrubbery to the conservatory?"

==> "We've been over all this ground," said Parker, with an expression of <==
distaste. "We agreed that we couldn't attach any importance to the story
of the shot."

"I'm afraid we've got to attach a great deal of importance to it," said
Lord Peter gravely. "Now, what does Mary do? Either she thought the

how does she dress to go and look for burglars? What would you or I have
done? I think we would have taken a dressing-gown, a stealthy kind of
pair of slippers, and perhaps a poker or a stout stick--not a pair of
walking-shoes, a coat, and a cap, of all things!"

==> "It was a wet night," mumbled Parker. <==

"My dear chap, if it's burglars you're looking for you don't expect to
go and hunt them round the garden. Your first thought is that they're
getting into the house, and your idea is to slip down quietly and survey
them from the staircase or behind the dining-room door. Anyhow, fancy a

to embellish herself in a cap for a burglar-hunt--damn it all, Charles,
it won't wash, you know! And she walks straight off to the conservatory
and comes upon the corpse, exactly as if she knew where to look for it
beforehand."

==> Parker shook his head again. <==

"Well, now. She sees Gerald stooping over Cathcart's body. What does she
say? Does she ask what's the matter? Does she ask who it is? She
exclaims: 'O God! Gerald, you've killed him,' and _then_ she says, as if
on second thoughts, 'Oh, it's Denis! What has happened? Has there been

"Yes. And shortly afterwards she came down and joined the others in the
conservatory, and it was at this point everybody remembered noticing
that she was wearing a cap and coat and walking-shoes over pyjamas and
bare feet."

==> "You are suggesting," said Parker, "that Lady Mary was already awake and <==
dressed at three o'clock, that she went out by the conservatory door
with her suit-case, expecting to meet the--the murderer of her--damn it,
Wimsey!"

"We needn't go so far as that," said Peter; "we decided that she

"Of course!" cried Wimsey. "I'm a fool! Yes. Then she said, 'It's
Denis--what has happened?' That's quite clear. And, meanwhile, what did
she do with the suit-case?"

==> "I see it all now," cried Parker. "When she saw that the body wasn't the <==
body of No. 10 she realised that No. 10 must be the murderer. So her
game was to prevent anybody knowing that No. 10 had been there. So she
shoved the suit-case behind the cacti. Then, when she went upstairs, she
pulled it out again, and hid it in the oak chest on the landing. She
couldn't take it to her room, of course, because if anybody'd heard her

"That's about it," said Peter. "I suppose she was so desperately anxious
to throw us off the scent of No. 10 that it never occurred to her that
her story was going to help implicate her brother."

==> "She realised it at the inquest," said Parker eagerly. "Don't you <==
remember how hastily she grasped at the suicide theory?"

"And when she found that she was simply saving her--well, No. 10--in
order to hang her brother, she lost her head, took to her bed, and
refused to give any evidence at all. Seems to me there's an extra

"And when she found that she was simply saving her--well, No. 10--in

refused to give any evidence at all. Seems to me there's an extra
allowance of fools in my family," said Peter gloomily.

==> "Well, what could she have done, poor girl?" asked Parker. He had been <==
growing almost cheerful again. "Anyway, she's cleared----"

"After a fashion," said Peter, "but we're not out of the wood yet by a
long way. Why is she hand-in-glove with No. 10, who is at least a
blackmailer if not a murderer? How did Gerald's revolver come on the

blackmailer if not a murderer? How did Gerald's revolver come on the
scene? And the green-eyed cat? How much did Mary know of that meeting
between No. 10 and Denis Cathcart? And if she was seeing and meeting the
man she might have put the revolver into his hands any time."

==> "No, no," said Parker. "Wimsey, don't think such ugly things as that." <==

"Hell!" cried Peter, exploding. "I'll have the truth of this beastly
business if we all go to the gallows together!"

At this moment Bunter entered with a telegram addressed to Wimsey. Lord

and again he went over the Riddlesdale Case, checking his notes here,
amplifying them there, involving his tired brain in speculations of the
most fantastic kind. He wandered about the room, taking down here and
there a book from the shelves, strumming a few unskilful bars upon the
piano, glancing through the weeklies, fidgeting restlessly. At length he

that she wore evening dress, with light green silk stockings and heavy

statement to you now? Or do I do it at the police-station?"

==> Parker groaned. <==

"They won't--they won't punish me so badly if it was an accident, will
they?" There was a quiver in the voice.

"No, of course not--of course not. But if only you had spoken earlier!

"They won't--they won't punish me so badly if it was an accident, will
they?" There was a quiver in the voice.

"No, of course not--of course not. But if only you had spoken earlier!
==> No," said Parker, stopping suddenly short in his distracted pacing and <==
sitting down beside her. "It's impossible--absurd." He caught the girl's
hand, suddenly in his own. "Nothing will convince me," he said. "It's
absurd. It's not like you."

"But an accident----"

"_No_!" The girl sprang to her feet, wrenching her hand away. "There was
no other man. How dare you say it or think it! I killed Denis Cathcart,
I tell you, and you _shall_ believe it. I swear to you that there was no
other man."

==> Parker pulled himself together. <==

"Sit down, please. Lady Mary, you are determined to make this
statement?"

"Yes."

"Knowing that I have no choice but to act upon it?"

"If you will not hear it I shall go straight to the police."

==> Parker pulled out his note-book. "Go on," he said. <==

With no other sign of emotion than a nervous fidgeting with her gloves,
Lady Mary began her confession in a clear, hard voice, as though she
were reciting it by heart.

out of his mind. He pulled out a revolver; I caught his hand; we
struggled; I got the muzzle right up against his chest, and--either I
pulled the trigger or it went off of itself--I'm not clear which. It was
all in such a whirl."

==> She paused. Parker's pen took down the words, and his face showed <==
growing concern. Lady Mary went on:

"He wasn't quite dead. I helped him up. We struggled back nearly to the
house. He fell once----"

Lady Mary hesitated.

"It didn't occur to me. It was a nightmare. I could only think of

a coherent thought. It wasn't till my brother came along that I realised
what I'd done, and that I might be suspected of murdering him. I was
simply terrified. I made up my mind all in a moment that I'd pretend I
knew nothing--that I'd heard a shot and come down. You know what I did."

==> "Why, Lady Mary," said Parker, in a perfectly toneless voice, "why did <==
you say to your brother 'Good God, Gerald, you've killed him'?"

Another hesitant pause.

"I never said that. I said, 'Good God, Gerald, he's killed, then.' I

"You admitted to those words at the inquest?"

"Yes----" Her hands knotted the gloves into all manner of shapes. "By
that time I had decided on a burglar story, you see."

==> The telephone bell rang, and Parker went to the instrument. A voice came <==
thinly over the wire:

"Is that 110A Piccadilly? This is Charing Cross Hospital. A man was
brought in to-night who says he is Lord Peter Wimsey. He was shot in the
shoulder, and struck his head in falling. He has only just recovered

brought in to-night who says he is Lord Peter Wimsey. He was shot in the
shoulder, and struck his head in falling. He has only just recovered
consciousness. He was brought in at 9.15. No, he will probably do very
well now. Yes, come round by all means."

==> "Peter has been shot," said Parker. "Will you come round with me to <==
Charing Cross Hospital? They say he is in no danger: still----"

"Oh, quick!" cried Lady Mary.

Gathering up Mr. Bunter as they hurried through the hall, detective and

despite a throbbing shoulder and a splitting headache, was undoubtedly
Lord Peter himself, who lay upon the chesterfield surrounded with
cushions and carousing upon tea and toast. Having been brought home in
an ambulance, he had instantly fallen into a healing sleep, and had
woken at nine o'clock aggressively clear and active in mind. In
==> consequence, Mr. Parker had been dispatched in a hurry, half-fed and <==
burdened with the secret memory of last night's disclosures, to Scotland
Yard. Here he had set in motion the proper machinery for catching Lord
Peter's assassin. "Only don't you say anything about the attack on me,"
said his lordship. "Tell 'em he's to be detained in connection with the
Riddlesdale case. That's good enough for them." It was now eleven, and

burdened with the secret memory of last night's disclosures, to Scotland
Yard. Here he had set in motion the proper machinery for catching Lord
Peter's assassin. "Only don't you say anything about the attack on me,"
said his lordship. "Tell 'em he's to be detained in connection with the
Riddlesdale case. That's good enough for them." It was now eleven, and
==> Mr. Parker had returned, gloomy and hungry, and was consuming a belated <==
omelette and a glass of claret.

Lady Mary Wimsey was hunched up in the window-seat. Her bobbed golden
hair made a little blur of light about her in the pale autumn sunshine.
She had made an attempt to breakfast early, and now sat gazing out into

[line number in individual story] matching line = 5291    window = 5286 5296

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 12583    window = 12578 12588


She had made an attempt to breakfast early, and now sat gazing out into
Piccadilly. Her first appearance that morning had been made in Lord
Peter's dressing-gown, but she now wore a serge skirt and jade-green
jumper, which had been brought to town for her by the fourth member of
the party, now composedly eating a mixed grill and sharing the decanter
==> with Parker. <==

This was a rather short, rather plump, very brisk elderly lady, with
bright black eyes like a bird's, and very handsome white hair
exquisitely dressed. Far from looking as though she had just taken a
long night journey, she was easily the most composed and trim of the

you _must_ run off to town, why do it in that unfinished manner? If you
had only looked up the trains before starting, you would have seen you
would have half an hour's wait at Northallerton, and you could quite
easily have packed a bag. It's so much better to do things neatly and
thoroughly--even stupid things. And it was very stupid of you indeed to
==> dash off like that, to embarrass and bore poor Mr. Parker with a lot of <==
twaddle--though I suppose it was Peter you meant to see. You know,
Peter, if you will haunt low places full of Russians and sucking
Socialists taking themselves seriously, you ought to know better than to
encourage them by running after them, however futile, and given to
drinking coffee and writing poems with no shape to them, and generally

drinking coffee and writing poems with no shape to them, and generally
ruining their nerves. And in any case, it makes not the slightest
difference; I could have told Peter all about it myself, if he doesn't
know already, as he probably does."

==> Lady Mary turned very white at this and glanced at Parker, who replied <==
rather to her than to the Dowager:

"No. Lord Peter and I haven't had time to discuss anything yet."

"Lest it should ruin my shattered nerves and bring a fever to my aching

for his long lips twitched at the corners, and he tucked the slip of
paper away in his pocket-book with a little sigh of satisfaction. He
called to Bunter to take away the breakfast-tray and to renew the
cooling bandage about his brow. This done, Lord Peter leaned back among
his cushions, and with an air of malicious enjoyment launched at Mr.
==> Parker the inquiry: <==

"Well, now, how did you and Mary get on last night? Polly, did you tell
him you'd done the murder?"

Few things are more irritating than to discover, after you have been at

[line number in individual story] matching line = 5362    window = 5357 5367

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 12654    window = 12649 12659


him you'd done the murder?"

Few things are more irritating than to discover, after you have been at
great pains to spare a person some painful intelligence, that he has
known it all along and is not nearly so much affected by it as he
==> properly should be. Mr. Parker quite simply and suddenly lost his <==
temper. He bounded to his feet, and exclaimed, without the least reason:
"Oh, it's perfectly hopeless trying to do anything!"

Lady Mary sprang from the window-seat.


[line number in individual story] matching line = 5379    window = 5374 5384

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 12671    window = 12666 12676


"As a matter of fact," replied his lordship, "I rather fancy Polly's
right. Hope so, I'm sure. Anyway, we've got the fellow, so now we shall
know."

Lady Mary gave a sort of gasp, and stepped forward with her chin up and
==> her hands tightly clenched. It caught at Parker's heart to see <==
overwhelming catastrophe so bravely faced. The official side of him was
thoroughly bewildered, but the human part ranged itself instantly in
support of that gallant defiance.

"Whom have they got?" he demanded, in a voice quite unlike his own.

[line number in individual story] matching line = 5393    window = 5388 5398

to Folkestone they didn't have much difficulty."

"It isn't true," said Lady Mary. She stamped. "It's a lie. He wasn't
there. He's innocent. I killed Denis."

==> "Fine," thought Parker, "fine! Damn Goyles, anyway, what's he done to <==
deserve it?"

Lord Peter said: "Mary, don't be an ass."

"Yes," said the Dowager placidly. "I was going to suggest to you, Peter,

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 12694    window = 12689 12699



"Yes," said the Dowager placidly. "I was going to suggest to you, Peter,
that this Mr. Goyles--such a terrible name, Mary dear, I can't say I
ever cared for it, even if there had been nothing else against
him--especially as he would sign himself Geo. Goyles--G. e. o. you know,
==> Mr. Parker, for George, and I never _could_ help reading it as <==
Gargoyles--I very nearly wrote to you, my dear, mentioning Mr. Goyles
and, asking if you could see him in town, because there was something,
when I came to think of it, about that ipecacuanha business that made me
feel he might have something to do with it."

feel he might have something to do with it."

"Yes," said Peter, with a grin, "you always did find him a bit
sickenin', didn't you?"

==> "How can you, Wimsey?" growled Parker reproachfully, with his eyes on <==
Mary's face.

"Never mind him," said the girl. "If you can't be a gentleman,
Peter----"

"Silly boy," said the Duchess, "don't get so excited. And it's time for

Mr. Parker obeyed in silence. Lady Mary came slowly across, and stood
looking at her brother.

"Peter," she said, "what makes you say that _he_ did it?"

did. I haven't had the man arrested. I've made no charge at all--have I,

"To detain Goyles pending inquiries, because he was wanted as a witness
in the Riddlesdale case," said Parker slowly.

"He knows nothing about it," said Mary, doggedly now. "He wasn't
anywhere near. He is innocent of _that_!"

"Do you think so?" said Lord Peter gravely. "If you know he is innocent,

"Mary, have you thought what you are doing? You are perjuring yourself
and putting Gerald in peril of his life, in order to shield from justice
a man whom you suspect of murdering your lover and who has most
certainly tried to murder me."

the fellow, and we appreciate your decision enormously. Truly, we do.

"Well, it really all started years ago with George. You were at the
Front then, Peter, but I suppose they told you about it--and put
everything in the worst possible light."

"Oh yes; heaps of times. And he gave me a diamond and tortoiseshell

"Then we may disregard the whole of last night's elaborate confession,"

really not bad, Polly, not bad at all. You've a talent for romantic
fiction--no, I mean it! Just here and there you need more attention to

"Perhaps he had at some time set his heart on something unattainable,"
==> said Parker. <==

"Well, I don't know," said Mr. Murbles. "People used to say that the
dream-lady had not always been a dream, but that he never could bring
himself to propose."

more I am inclined to feel that Mr. Featherstone chose the better part."

"And are determined to follow his example--in that respect at any rate?
Eh, Sir Impey!" replied Mr. Murbles, with a mild chuckle.

==> Mr. Parker glanced towards the window. It was beginning to rain. <==

Truly enough the '47 port was a dead thing; the merest ghost of its old
flame and flavour hung about it. Lord Peter held his glass poised a
moment.

What classic pith and brevity in those four lines!--However, in the
matter of this case, we've a good deal to tell you, sir."

==> With the assistance of Parker, he laid before the two men of law the <==
whole train of the investigation up to date, Lady Mary coming loyally up
to the scratch with her version of the night's proceedings.

"In fact, you see," said Peter, "this Mr. Goyles has lost a lot by not
being a murderer. We feel he would have cut a fine, sinister figure as a

being a murderer. We feel he would have cut a fine, sinister figure as a
midnight assassin. But things bein' as they are, you see, we must make
what we can of him as a witness, what?"

"Well, Lord Peter," said Mr. Murbles slowly, "I congratulate you and Mr.

out."

"I think we may say we have made some progress," said Parker.

"If only negatively," added Peter.

"If only negatively," added Peter.

"Exactly," said Sir Impey, turning on him with staggering abruptness.
"Very negatively indeed. And, having seriously hampered the case for the

determined family," he added, "and I fear that, for the present, it is
useless to pursue that line of investigation. If we could discover the
truth in some other way, and confront the Duke with it, he might then be
persuaded to add his confirmation."

==> "Well, now," said Parker, "we have, as it seems to me, still three lines <==
to go upon. First, we must try to establish the Duke's alibi from
external sources. Secondly, we can examine the evidence afresh with a
view to finding the real murderer. And thirdly, the Paris police may
give us some light upon Cathcart's past history."

"And I fancy I know where to go next for information on the second
point," said Wimsey, suddenly. "Grider's Hole."

bloodthirsty farmer fellow lives, isn't it, who set the dogs on you?"

"With the remarkable wife. Yes. See here, how does this strike you? This
fellow is ferociously jealous of his wife, and inclined to suspect every
man who comes near her. When I went up there that day, and mentioned

time she must have seen my old cap and Burberry from the window and
mistaken me for Goyles, but, now I come to think of it, I told the kid
who came to the door that I was from Riddlesdale Lodge. If the child
told her mother, she must have thought it was Cathcart."

Cathcart was dead by that time."

"Oh, damn it! Yes, I suppose she must. Unless that surly old devil kept
the news from her. By Jove! that's just what he would do if he'd killed
Cathcart himself. He'd never say a word to her--and I don't suppose he

Continental ideas about marriage and that sort of thing. I don't think
he'd have thought that mattered very much. He'd probably have said there
was a time and place for everything."

"One of those watertight compartment minds," said Wimsey thoughtfully.
==> Mr. Parker, despite his long acquaintance with the seamy side of things <==
in London, had his brows set in a gloomy frown of as fierce a provincial
disapproval as ever came from Barrow-in-Furness.

"If you can upset this Grimethorpe's alibi," said Sir Impey, fitting his
right-hand finger-tips neatly between the fingers of his left hand, "we

"By Jove!" cried Wimsey; "driven off alone, stopped somewhere, left the
gee, sneaked back, met Cathcart, done him in, and toddled home next day
with a tale about machinery."

precise times very carefully."

"Hurray!" cried Wimsey. "I think I'll be gettin' back to Riddlesdale."

came at length to the slip of blotting-paper from the study at
Riddlesdale, to whose fragmentary markings he had since given scarcely a
thought.

==> Presently Mr. Parker, finishing his port and recalling his mind with an <==
effort, remembered that he had been meaning to tell Peter something
before the name of Lady Mary had driven all other thoughts out of his
head. He turned to his host, open-mouthed for speech, but his remark
never got beyond a preliminary click like that of a clock about to
strike, for, even as he turned, Lord Peter brought his fist down on the

perfectly splendid for you to see your way so clearly, but I never read

Lord Peter passed the relic over without comment.

"No!" said Wimsey incredulously. "And when you actually saw me take it

anything sinister about the blot?"

some bewilderment. His description of the discovery of the green-eyed
cat was eagerly listened to. He also gave a minute account of the
footprints and marks of dragging, especially the imprint of a hand in

photographs of it circulated among the peers. A long discussion ensued

for lunch, some of us should make the experiment, choosing a member of

round at one another to see which unfortunate might be chosen for the

window.

"In your opinion, could the catch have been forced back by the knife
found on the body of the deceased?"

number of officers who testified to the excellent war record of the

Bois-Gobey Houdin, who perfectly recollected a very uncomfortable
dispute on a certain occasion when playing cards with le Capitaine
Cathcart, and having subsequently mentioned the matter to Monsieur

diligence that had unearthed this witness, and he looked across with an
undisguised grin at the discomfited Sir Wigmore Wrinching. When Mr.
Glibbery had dealt with all these the afternoon was well advanced, and
the Lord High Steward accordingly asked the lords if it was their
pleasure that the House be adjourned till the next day at 10.30 of the

chorus, the House was accordingly adjourned.

A scurry of swift black clouds with ragged edges was driving bleakly
westward as they streamed out into Parliament Square, and the seagulls

ancient Burberry closely about him as he scrambled on to a 'bus to get
home to Great Ormond Street. It was only one more drop in his cup of
discomfort that the conductor greeted him with "Outside only!" and rang
the bell before he could get off again. He climbed to the top and sat
there holding his hat on. Mr. Bunter returned sadly to 110A Piccadilly,

much before he started, and spent the night in the ditch, or it might be
Gerald's death you'd be inquiring into, and mine, as well as the other."

It gave Mary an odd shock to hear her brother's name spoken like that,
by that speaker and in that company. She asked suddenly, apropos of

"No, my dear," said Mr. Murbles reprovingly, "this is not a police
matter."

colour to this unreasonable indictment.

"And here I will direct your lordships' attention to the very important

While the Attorney-General was engaged in the ungrateful task of trying
to obscure what was not only plain, but agreeable to everybody's

"Just natural imbecility," said Lord Peter. "I say, poor old Cathcart.
She _was_ a girl! For the matter of that, I suppose she still is. I
don't know why I should talk as if she'd died away the moment I took my
eyes off her."

==> "Horribly self-centred, you are," grumbled Mr. Parker. <==

"I know. I always was from a child. But what worries me is that I seem

couldn't 'elp it."

==> Lord Peter and Parker arrived together, panting. <==

"Here, constable," gasped his lordship; "I know this man. He has an
unfortunate grudge against my brother. In connection with a poaching
matter--up in Yorkshire. Tell the coroner to come to me for
information."

'Stra'or'nary thing," he added, as though struck by a new idea, "why
hashn't alarm gone off, Shugg?" He pointed a wavering finger at Big Ben.
"They've for-forgotten to wind it up. Dishgrayshful. I'll write to _The
T-T-Timesh_ about it."

==> Mr. Sugg wasted no words, but picked up the slumbering Parker and <==
hoisted him into the taxi.

"Never--never--deshert----" began Lord Peter, resisting all efforts to
dislodge him from the step, when a second taxi, advancing from
Whitehall, drew up, with the Hon. Freddy Arbuthnot cheering loudly at

Mr. Sugg scratched his head, gave Lord Peter's address, and watched the
cab drive off. Then, supporting the Hon. Freddy on his ample bosom, he

"You leave it to me, sir," said the Inspector. He glanced over his
shoulder at St. Stephen's, whence a group of Commons were just issuing
from an all-night sitting.

==> "Mr. Parker an' all," said Inspector Sugg, adding devoutly, "Thank Gawd <==
there weren't no witnesses."
