"Presumably so, my lady."

"_My lady_"--she had never really thought it possible that Bunter would
accept the situation. Everybody else, perhaps, but not Bunter. Yet
apparently he did. And that being so, the incredible must have happened.
==> She must be actually married to Peter Wimsey. She sat looking at Peter, <==
as the car twisted smoothly in and out of the traffic. The high, beaked
profile, and the long hands laid on the wheel had been familiar to her
for a long time now; but they were suddenly the face and hands of a
stranger. (Peter's hands, holding the keys of hell and heaven...that was
the novelist's habit, of thinking of everything in terms of literary

won't take no time to get straight w'en you and your good gentleman
comes back with the keys. Excuse me, mum, wot might your married name
be?"

her name.

"I never!" said Mrs. Ruddle. "That's wot 'e said"--she jerked her head
at Bunter--"but _I_ didn't pay no 'eed to 'im. Begging your pardon, mum,

really reliable person in the party. Now, Mrs. Ruddle, we'll run over
and get the keys from Miss Twitterton and be back in twenty minutes.
Bunter, you'd better stay here and give Mrs. Ruddle a hand with the
things. Is there room to turn?"

"Yes, my lady. Thank you, my lady."

"After which," said Peter, when they had reversed through the gate and
were once again headed for Great Pagford, "Bunter will proceed to make
it quite plain to Mrs. Ruddle--in case she hasn't grasped the idea--that
==> Lord and Lady Peter Wimsey are my lord and lady. Poor old Bunter! Never <==
have his feelings been so harrowed. Film-actors, by the look of you! No
better than you should be! These commercial fellers will say anythink!"

"Oh, Peter! I wish I could have married Bunter. I do love him so."

"It looks rather unwell already, Harriet. I think my constitution is the
better of the two. Here goes. But you might kiss me to take the taste

She hoped that, after his struggles with the woodshed, he would find a
good, roaring fire to greet him and be able to eat his belated meal in
comfort.

==> Peter Wimsey rather hoped so, too. It took a long time to clear the <==
woodshed, which contained not very much wood, but an infinite quantity
of things like dilapidated mangles and wheelbarrows, together with the
remains of an old pony-trap, several disused grates and a galvanised
iron boiler with a hole in it. But he had his doubts about the weather,
and was indisposed to allow Mrs. Merdle (the ninth Daimler of that name)

inclemency of the atmosphere.

"Bunter," said Harriet, "you are marvellous."

you to look after _yourself_. This is the first time you have ever
refused to take my orders. I hope you will not make it a precedent."

"No, my lord. I have dismissed Mrs. Ruddle, after enlisting her services

contemplated her sleeping lord. With the mocking eyes hidden and the
confident mouth relaxed, his big, bony nose and tumbled hair gave him a
gawky, fledgling look, like a schoolboy. And the hair itself was almost
as light as tow--it was ridiculous that anything male should be as fair
as that. No doubt when it was damped and sleeked down for the day his

"The sitting-room will be required first," said Mr. Bunter. "In the
kitchen I can, for the immediate moment, manage with the oil-stove. This
way, Mr. Puffett, if you please."

==> Mrs. Ruddle, who, as far as the Wimseys were concerned, was a new broom, <==
had made a clean and determined sweep of the sitting-room, draping all
the uglier pieces of furniture with particular care in dust-sheets,
covering the noisy rugs with newspaper, decorating with handsome dunce's
caps two exceptionally rampageous bronze cavaliers which flanked the
fireplace on pedestals and were too heavy to move, and tying up in a

Frank Crutchley's eyes wandered over the room as though seeking counsel
from the dust-sheets, the aspidistras, the chimney, the bronze horsemen,
Mr. Puffett's bowler, the cactus and the radio cabinet, before at length
coming to rest on Peter's in mute appeal.

==> "Let's start from the right end," suggested Wimsey. "Mr. Noakes was here <==
last Wednesday and went off the same night to catch the ten o'clock bus
to Broxford. That was nothing unusual, I gather. But he expected to be
back to deal with the matter of our arrival, and you, in fact, expected
to find him here to-day."

"Is he usually here when you come on Wednesdays?"

"Well, that depends, sir. Not always."

==> "Frank!" cried Miss Twitterton, outraged, "it's Lord Peter Wimsey. You <==
ought to say 'my lord.'"

"Never mind that now," said Peter, kindly, but irritated by this
interference with his witness. Crutchley looked at Miss Twitterton with
the expression of a small boy who has been publicly exhorted to wash

I never thought he was expecting no money in particular. Making excuses,
he was. Never pays out money till the last moment, and not then if he
can 'elp it. Might lose 'arf a day's interest, don't you see," added
Crutchley, with a sudden half-reluctant grin.

==> "Sound principle, so far as it goes," said Wimsey. <==

"That's right; that's the way he's made his bit. He's a warm man, is Mr.
Noakes. Still, all the same for that, I told him I wanted the forty
pound for my new garridge----"

"Good morning, sir," said Peter, feeling it better to introduce himself
than to wait for Miss Twitterton. "Delighted to see you. My name's

"I'm afraid we're all at sixes and sevens," said Harriet. Mr. Goodacre,
she thought, had not changed much in the last seventeen years. He was a
little greyer, a little thinner, a little baggier about the knees and
shoulders, but in essentials the same Mr. Goodacre she and her father

"Balliol, sir," said Peter.

"Magdalen," returned Mr. Goodacre, unaware that by merely saying "Keble"
he could have shattered a reputation. He grasped Peter's hand and shook

"Cricket, perhaps," suggested Peter, helpfully.

"Yes," said the vicar, "ye--yes. Cricket and---- Ah, Frank! Am I in your
way?"

sharp black eyes that seemed to inventory everything they encountered,
and a highly regrettable tie. He rapidly summed up the vicar and Mr.
Puffett, dismissed them from his calculations, and made a bee-line for
the monocle.

to trouble your lordship. Understand you're stopping here. Fact is, I
have to see Mr. Noakes on a little matter of business."

"Just so," said Peter, easily. "Any fog in Town this morning?"

was plying about his feet, and sat down, uninvited, on the settle.

"Young man," said Mr. Goodacre, rebukingly, "you had better keep a civil

assurance that we do not know where to find Mr. Noakes. You do not
suppose that his lordship would tell you an untruth?"

"_Whose_ money? I don't understand. What's it all got to do with Uncle
William?"

"Peter," said Harriet, "don't you think----?"

==> "It's no good," said Wimsey. "It's got to come out." <==

"See this?" said Mr. MacBride. "That's a writ, that is. Little matter of
nine hundred pound."

"Nine 'undred?" Crutchley made a snatch for the paper as though it were

"_Afraid_ you've found him?" Master and man stared at one another, and
Harriet, reading the unspoken message in their eyes, came up to Peter
and laid a hand on his arm.

==> "For God's sake, Bunter," said Wimsey, with a strained note in his <==
voice, "don't say you've found---- Where? Down the cellar?"

The voice of Mrs. Ruddle broke the tension like the wail of a banshee:

"Frank! Frank Crutchley! It's Mr. Noakes!"

"Oh, dear! oh, dear!" cried Mrs. Ruddle. Her eyes gleamed with a dismal
triumph. "'Is pore 'ead's bashed in something shocking!"

tell us that this is murder?"

Miss Twitterton slid from Harriet's arms to the floor.

"I couldn't say, my lord; but it looks most unpleasantly like it."

assorted surprises, punctuated by the most incredible meals. Her
husband's impressions were even less coherent; he said he had had, all
the time, the sensation of being slightly drunk and tossed in a blanket.
The freakish and arbitrary fates must have given the blanket an

He went out, leaving the atmosphere clearer, as though by the removal of
funeral flowers.

"I'm afraid that's true," said Harriet.

==> "Just as well, isn't it?" Wimsey's tone was studiously light. "When I'm <==
investigating a murder, I hate to have too much sympathy with the
corpse. Personal feelings cramp the style."

"But, Peter--need you investigate this? It's rather rotten for you."

"No, no," said Harriet. Mr. Kirk hastened to reassure the witness.

squeak of alarm; for the first time, perhaps, she realised where all
this had to end. Harriet was angry, and her face showed it. Men; when
they got together they were all alike--even Peter. For a moment he and
Kirk stood together on the far side of a chasm, and she hated them both.

"Dear, dear, that'll never do." Kirk was jovial; but the brown ox-eyes

investigating it as things were. Why, come to think of it, Mrs. Kirk had

distinctly remembered laughing, and saying, "It's wonderful what these

breakfast, and he said, 'I can't hear nothing,' he said, 'only there's a

went out again, and that's the last I see of him."

coming in and upsetting everything. Though he was not an imaginative
man, he could see Sellon, startled by hearing that there was someone in
the house, rushing out to learn the news, perplexed beyond expression by
the fact that no body had been found, not daring to go and make open
inquiries, but hovering round the house, manufacturing excuses for

There was only one thing that gave him comfort--a comfort altogether

believe Sellon, if it came to that--there was no sense in it at all--but
it had sounded, well, genuine. He could hear again Sellon's desperate
cry: "Don't _you_ go, my lord! My lord, _you_'ll believe me!" Kirk,
rummaging the filing-cabinet of his mind, found words which seemed to
him apt. Thou hast appealed unto Cæsar; unto Cæsar thou shalt go. But

Mr. Hector Puncheon of the _Morning Star_ was less lucky. He arrived
five minutes after Salcombe Hardy's departure, and found Lady Peter
==> Wimsey still leaning over the gate. Since he could scarcely force his <==
way past her, he was obliged to take his story then and there, as she
chose to give it to him. Half way through, he felt something blow warmly
upon his neck, and turned round with a start.

"It's only a bull," said Harriet, sweetly.

that of her uncle, William Noakes, and that she had not seen him since
the last Sunday week. She explained her uncle's habit of dividing his
time between Broxford and Paggleham, and about the two sets of keys. Her
endeavours to explain also about the sale of the house and the
astonishing financial situation disclosed were kindly but firmly cut
==> short, and Lord Peter Wimsey, in act more graceful, took her place and <==
gave a brief and rather nonchalant _résumé_ of his surprising
wedding-night experiences. He handed the coroner various papers
concerning the purchase of the house and sat down amid a murmur of
sympathetic comment. Then came an accountant from Broxford, with a
statement about the moribund condition of the wireless business, as

'ar-pas'-nine."

"How did you know that?"

Mrs. Ruddle, with many circumlocutions, embarked upon the story of the
==> wireless. Peter Wimsey wrote a few lines on a scrap of paper, which he <==
folded and passed to Kirk. The Superintendent nodded, and passed it on
to the coroner, who, at the conclusion of the story, asked:

"Wireless was Mr. Noakes's business?"

"I wondered how much he really did remember. If he's not sure about the
candle, he may only have imagined the clock."

"That's so," said Kirk, slowly. He was not sure about the implications
==> of this. Nor, to tell the truth, was Wimsey. <==

"He might," Harriet suggested softly in her husband's ear, "have lied
about the time."

"So he might. The queer thing is that he didn't. Mrs. Ruddle's clock

"I'm positive it is ours. Something tells me so. Let us register our
claim to it by a trifling act of vandalism which the first rain will
blot out." He solemnly took out a pencil and inscribed upon the pot:

The library, with its tall bays and overhanging gallery, looked east and
was already rather dark. Harriet found it restful. She wandered along
pulling out here and there a calf-bound volume at random, sniffing the
sweet, musty odour of ancient books, smiling at a carved panel over one
==> of the fireplaces, on which the Wimsey mice had escaped from the coat of <==
arms and played in and out of a heavily undercut swag of flowers and
wheat-ears. A large table, littered deep in books and papers, she judged
to belong to Cousin Matthew--a half-written sheet in an elderly man's
rather tremulous writing appeared to be part of a family chronicle;
propped open on a stand beside it was a fat manuscript book, containing

of his identity.

"Oh!" said Harriet, "I didn't know anyone was here. Are you----" Cousin
Matthew must have a surname, of course; the potty cousin at Nice was the
next heir, she remembered, after Gerald's and Peter's lines, so they

quite well be Colonel Wimsey, or Sir Matthew Wimsey, or even Lord
Somebody.) "I'm Peter's wife," she added, by way of explaining her

Harriet accepted the muffin, and said, turning to Cousin Matthew:

"I made a silly mistake just now. I met somebody in the library and

"Eh?" said Cousin Matthew. "What's that? Somebody in the library?"

can't think that all that damp heat is good for his vibrations, or
whatever they call them--last time I saw him he looked quite foggy, poor
thing!"

Brameld's landscapes.... You wouldn't think anyone who talked so much

                            NEW-WEDDED LORD

        I agree with Dryden, that "Marriage is a noble daring"--
                                      SAMUEL JOHNSON: _Table Talk_.

==> Mr. Mervyn Bunter, patiently seated in the Daimler on the far side of <==
Regent's Park, reflected that time was getting on. Packed in eiderdowns
in the back of the car was a case containing two and a half dozen of
vintage port, and he was anxious about it. Great speed would render the
wine undrinkable for a fortnight; excessive speed would render it
undrinkable for six months. He was anxious about the arrangements--or

instructed, to see to things. Not but what his lordship was always ready
to put up with what couldn't be helped; but it was unsuitable that his
lordship should be called on to put up with anything--besides, the lady
was still, to some extent, an unknown factor. What his lordship had had
to put up with from _her_ during the past five or six years, only his
==> lordship knew, but Mr. Bunter could guess. True, the lady seemed now to <==
be in a very satisfactory way of amendment; but it was yet to be
ascertained what her conduct would be under the strain of trivial
inconvenience. Mr. Bunter was professionally accustomed to judge human
beings by their behaviour, not in great crises, but in the minor
adjustments of daily life. He had seen one lady threatened with

beings by their behaviour, not in great crises, but in the minor
adjustments of daily life. He had seen one lady threatened with
dismissal from his lordship's service (including all emoluments and the
enjoyment of an _appartement meublé_, Ave. Kléber) for having, in his
presence, unreasonably lost her temper with a lady's maid; but wives
==> were not subject to peremptory dismissal. Mr. Bunter was anxious, also, <==
about how things were going at the Dowager's; he did not really believe
that anything could be suitably organised or carried out without his
assistance.

He was unspeakably relieved to see the taxi arrive and to assure himself

[line number in individual story] matching line = 47    window = 42 52

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 123618    window = 123613 123623



He was unspeakably relieved to see the taxi arrive and to assure himself
that there was no newspaper man perched on the spare wheel, or lurking
in a following vehicle.

==> "Here we are, Bunter. All serene? Good man. I'll drive. Sure you won't <==
be cold, Harriet?"

Mr. Bunter tucked a rug about the bride's knees.

"Your lordship will bear in mind that we are conveying the port?"

"Your lordship will bear in mind that we are conveying the port?"

"I will go as gingerly as if it were a baby in arms. What's the matter
with the rug?"

"That must have been Lord Saint-George," said Harriet.

"Presumably so, my lady."

==> "_My lady_"--she had never really thought it possible that Bunter would <==
accept the situation. Everybody else, perhaps, but not Bunter. Yet
apparently he did. And that being so, the incredible must have happened.
She must be actually married to Peter Wimsey. She sat looking at Peter,
as the car twisted smoothly in and out of the traffic. The high, beaked
profile, and the long hands laid on the wheel had been familiar to her

other Englishwoman. And that is the most I can say for myself."

Gradually, they were shaking off the clustering lights of London. The
car gathered speed. Peter looked back over his shoulder.

==> "Not waking the baby, are we, Bunter?" <==

"The vibration is at present negligible, my lord."

That led memory farther back.


[line number in individual story] matching line = 275    window = 270 280

"Then we shall firmly hand ourselves back to him," said Peter,
cheerfully. "People like you and me are not so easily got rid of. I told
him, any time after eight o'clock. This looks like the gate."

==> Bunter climbed out and approached the gate in eloquent silence. He had <==
known it; he had felt it in his bones; the arrangements had fallen
through. At whatever cost, even if he had had to strangle pressmen with
his bare hands, he ought to have come ahead to see to things. In the
glare of the headlights a patch of white paper showed clearly on the top
bar of the gate; he looked suspiciously at it, removed, with careful

[line number in individual story] matching line = 297    window = 292 302

can spell 'notice' in his letter to us. The 'somebody' is a little
lacking in thought not to realise that _we_ might want bread and milk.
However, we can remedy the matter."

He reversed the paper, wrote in pencil on the back "BREAD AND MILK,
==> PLEASE," and restored it to Bunter, who tin-tacked it back and gloomily <==
opened the gate. The car moved slowly past him, up a short and muddy
approach, on either side of which were flower-beds, carefully tended and
filled with chrysanthemums and dahlias, while behind them rose the dark
outlines of some sheltering bushes.


[line number in individual story] matching line = 303    window = 298 308

opened the gate. The car moved slowly past him, up a short and muddy
approach, on either side of which were flower-beds, carefully tended and
filled with chrysanthemums and dahlias, while behind them rose the dark
outlines of some sheltering bushes.

==> "A load of gravel would have done them no harm," observed Bunter to <==
himself, as he picked a disdainful way through the mud. When he reached
the door--massive and uncompromising, within an oaken porch having seats
on either side--his lordship was already performing a brisk fantasia
upon the horn. There was no reply; nothing stirred in the house; no
candle darted its beams; no casement was thrown open; no shrill voice

[line number in individual story] matching line = 312    window = 307 317

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 123883    window = 123878 123888


upon the horn. There was no reply; nothing stirred in the house; no
candle darted its beams; no casement was thrown open; no shrill voice
demanded to know their business; only, in the near distance, a dog
barked irritably.

==> Mr. Bunter, gloomily self-restrained, grasped the heavy knocker and let <==
its summons thunder through the night. The dog barked again. He tried
the handle, but the door was fast.

"Oh, dear!" said Harriet.


[line number in individual story] matching line = 333    window = 328 338

had been brought up in the country and knew well enough that farm-houses
were more readily assailable in the rear. "If you can't find anybody
there, make for the place where the dog is."

He tootled on the horn again, the dog responded with a volley of yelps,
==> and the shadowy bulk that was Bunter moved round the side of the <==
building.

"That," continued Peter, with satisfaction, and throwing his hat into
the back of the car, "will keep him busy for quite a bit. We shall now
give one another that attention which, for the last thirty-six hours,

He retired into the scullery, where Mrs. Ruddle, armed with a hand-bowl,
was scooping boiling water from the copper into a large bath-can.

"Well, so I am. But one should not be selfish in one's happiness. I feel
convinced that somewhere about the house there is a fellow-creature in

"It seems," said Peter, "that we are expecting a happy event.

"It's all loaded and ready, sir," said Mrs. Ruddle, proudly conscious of

Miss Twitterton gave a faint squeak, and the vicar, thoughtfully turning

scullery, Crutchley and Mr. Puffett were clearing a quantity of pots and

appeared from the presence beside them of a steaming pail) to scrubbing

seemed to have arrived from nowhere in a motor van. Beyond them could be

the village. If anything further should be required, there is a jar of
caviar in the hamper, but we have no lemons, I am sorry to say."

==> "Oh, I don't think caviar would strike the right note, Bunter, do you?" <==

"No, my lady. The heavy luggage has just arrived, per Carter Paterson; I
instructed that it should be deposited in the oil-shed until we had
leisure to attend to it."

"I do wish he hadn't to be worried like this! It's too bad."

Harriet recognised as sympathy seemed to waft out of him. She said
impulsively:

husband's impressions were even less coherent; he said he had had, all

The freakish and arbitrary fates must have given the blanket an

the sweep's departure, recognised the tune. It was the one he had heard
the night before in the woodshed. Nothing could have been less suited to
the occasion, nothing should more deeply have offended his inborn sense
of propriety; yet, like the poet Wordsworth, he heard it and rejoiced.

were two candlesticks in this room, upon the sideboard. Both candles

with a pen-knife. Night's candles are burnt out."

it, adding, "I knew I should want Shakespeare again!"

"Well, now you know."

"Have we any idea," inquired his lordship, "what kind of a jolly old
blunt instrument we are looking for? How big? What shape?"

learning something. But to tell you the truth, we don't have many
murders and violent deaths hereabouts, so I don't get much practice in

Mr. MacBride was grateful, and said so. "It's all in the day's work," he

"Poor little Twitters," said Harriet. "Are you going to be there?"

"No. I'm going out for a breath of air. I'll come back presently."

added earnestly, as he propelled her over the threshold, "don't say

"Certainly not, my lord," said Mrs. Ruddle. The door closed. Kirk drew
himself up in the big chair; his subordinate sat huddled, waiting for
the explosion.

In the meantime, Mr. Puffett, having cleared the kitchen chimney from
above and assisted at the lighting of the fire, had taken his fee and
gone home, uttering many expressions of sympathy and goodwill. Finally,
Miss Twitterton, tearful but flattered, was conveyed to Pagford by

the back seat. Harriet saw her off and returned to the sitting-room,
where her lord and master was gloomily building a house of cards with a
greasy old pack which he had unearthed from the what-not.

"Well!" said Harriet, in unnaturally cheerful tones, "they've gone. At

any. In her own room, the traces of Miss Twitterton's brief occupation
had been removed--the eiderdown shaken, the pillows made smooth, the
hot-water bottle taken away, the disorder of washstand and
dressing-table set to rights. The doors and drawers left open by Kirk
had been shut, and a bowl of chrysanthemums stood on the window-sill.
==> Bunter, like a steam-roller, had passed over everything, flattening out <==
all traces of upheaval. She got the things she needed and carried them
down. The card house had reached the sixth storey. At the sound of her
step, Peter started, his hand shook, and the whole flimsy fabric
dissolved into ruins. He muttered something and began doggedly to
rebuild it.

"Yes, of course. By the way, you don't insist on a husband's right to
read his wife's letters?"

"Great heavens, no!" said Peter, horrified.

==> "I'm glad of that. It mightn't be good for you. Here's Bunter coming <==
back; we may get some tea. Mrs. Ruddle is in such a state of excitement
that she has probably boiled the milk and put the tea-leaves into the
sandwiches. I ought to have stood over her till she'd finished."

of course, his lordship required his services. He would prefer, if
permitted, to utilise the leisure so kindly placed at his disposal in a

also engaged Mr. Puffett's son-in-law to deal with the leak in the
copper and mend two broken panes in the scullery. He had found out the

an absence of lipstick; his lordship had a particular dislike of
pink-stained cigarette-ends. Nor, as he had before thankfully observed,
did her ladyship enamel her nails to the likeness of blood-stained
talons; a bottle of varnish there was, but it was barely tinted. Quite

At Talboys the sitting-room was dark, though a light still burned in the

"I suppose," he suggested, despairingly, "the clock couldn't have been

But the plastered wall showed no trace of any hook or nail to which the
clock might have been temporarily transferred. The nearest landmark to
the east was the nail supporting "The Soul's Awakening" and that to the
west, a fretwork bracket with a plaster image on it--both too light to

By a remarkable coincidence, no sooner had he gone than the invisible

"_I_ will see to the peas, Mrs. Ruddle, at the proper time." He looked
up at the clock, which marked five minutes past six. "His lordship is
very particular about peas."

"Is he now?" Mrs. Ruddle seemed to take this as a signal for
conversation, for she appeared on the threshold. "That's jest like my
Bert. 'Ma,' 'e allus says, 'I 'ates peas 'ard.' Funny, 'ow often they
_is_ 'ard. Or biled right away outer their shells. One or other."

==> Bunter offered no comment, and she tried again. "Ere's them things you <==
arst me to polish. Come up lovely, ain't they?"

She offered for inspection a brass toasting-fork and the fragment of a
roasting-jack that had so unexpectedly made its appearance from the
chimney.

She offered for inspection a brass toasting-fork and the fragment of a
roasting-jack that had so unexpectedly made its appearance from the
chimney.

==> "Thank you," said Bunter. He hung the toasting-fork on a nail by the <==
fireplace and, after a little consideration, set the other specimen
upright on the what-not.

"Funny," pursued Mrs. Ruddle, "the way the gentry is about them old bits
o' things. Curios! Rubbish, if you ask me."

"Funny," pursued Mrs. Ruddle, "the way the gentry is about them old bits
o' things. Curios! Rubbish, if you ask me."

==> "This is a very old piece," replied Bunter, gravely, stepping back to <==
admire the effect.

Mrs. Ruddle sniffed. "Reckon them as shoved it up the chimbley knew wot
they wos doin'. Give me a nice gas-oven any day. Ah! I'd like that--same
as my sister's wot lives in Biggleswade."

==> "People have been found dead in gas-ovens before now," said Bunter, <==
grimly. He took up his master's blazer, shook it, appeared to estimate
its contents by their weight, and removed a pipe, a tobacco-pouch and
three boxes of matches from one pocket.

"Lor' now, Mr. Bunter, don't you talk like that! Ain't we 'ad enough

"Ah!" said Mrs. Ruddle, with a deep, sentimental sigh. "And w'ere _'e's_
'appy, _she's_ 'appy. Ah! It's easy to see she worships the ground 'e
treads on."

His lordship----"

"There now!" interrupted Mrs. Ruddle. "If there ain't love's young dream
a-comin' up the path."

==> Bunter's brows beetled awfully. "To _whom_ might you be referring, Mrs. <==
Ruddle?" he demanded in a voice like Jupiter Tonans.

"W'y, that Frank Crutchley, to be sure."

"Oh!" Jupiter was appeased. "Crutchley? Is he your choice for a second?"

"Ah!" said Crutchley, apparently taking this as an intimation that
gossip might proceed unchecked. "Well, they've got a nice day for it."

compromised by leaning negligently against the end of the settle.

"They didn't get much forrader at the inquest, seems to me," observed
Crutchley.

its miscellaneous contents.

"'Ushin' it up," said Mrs. Ruddle, "that's wot they wos. Tryin' to make

vigilant eye and stern regard for the social proprieties, strolled
quietly over to the hearth.

"Ho!" said Mrs. Ruddle. She brought in a lighted lamp, set it on a table

up the poker.

"May I ask why you are loitering about here? Your work is outside. If

He touched his forehead significantly.

"People can do their own dirty work after this," she remarked,
witheringly, and departed.

his arm.

"All the port! All the port! Two and a half dozen, all shook up to

The lamp had been moved, so that she found herself in darkness--but the

But alarm is infectious...and much-tried men have been known to vent

waiting for the explosion.

happen again.... All right.... Good God, man, you needn't tell me that

The sounds died away, and the women breathed more freely. The dreadful

and I'd better stay here to keep an eye on the Solomons-MacBride
outfit."

brushing his best bowler. Are you coming down?"

LORDSHIP'S PROPERTY. DO NOT TOUCH. Coming up again into the light, she
encountered Crutchley entering by the back door. He started at seeing
her.

notice. But please tell the men specially that they mustn't on any
account lay a finger on those bottles."

Crutchley broke into a wide smile that showed Harriet how attractive his
face could be and threw light on the indiscretions of Miss Twitterton

himself--very solemn. He sets great store by that wine, seemin'ly. If
you could a-heard him yesterday ticking off Martha Ruddle----"

Harriet wished she had heard it, and was greatly tempted to ask for an
eye-witness account of the scene; but considered that Crutchley's

"It must be something the late owner picked up in a sale."

"Right you are, lady," said the head--Jack's, presumably--and
disappeared whistling.

==> Her own clothes were packed. Bunter had come up shortly after <==
breakfast--while Peter was writing letters--and had discovered her
struggling with the orange frock. After watching her thoughtfully for a
few moments he had offered his assistance, and it had been accepted with
relief. The more intimate parts of the business had, after all, been
effected previously--though, when Harriet saw her underwear unpacked

mourner behind so important a hearse had evidently restored all her lost
self-importance. Mrs. Ruddle followed. Her mantle, of strange and
ancient cut, glittered with black beads, and the jet ornaments on her
bonnet danced even more gaily than they had done at the inquest. Her

pile of prayer-books and a severe-looking bowler, might, by contrast,
have been the deceased's nearest and dearest relative, so determined was
his countenance in an appropriate gloom. After Bunter came, rather
unexpectedly, Mr. Puffett, in a curious greenish-black cutaway coat of
incredible age, buttoned perilously across his sweaters over his working

curly-brimmed pattern affected by young bloods of the 'nineties.

"How very chaste and appropriate!"

"_Everybody_ was there," said Miss Twitterton. "Dr. Craven came over,

"Very good, my lord."

"I'm afraid they've commandeered the beer-barrel," said Harriet, with a

"Dear me, dear me!" said Mr. Goodacre. "Thank you. Ah! yes, indeed."

He turned the wine musingly upon his tongue and appeared to compare its
flavour favourably with that of the best sherry in Pagford.

==> "Bunter--you've got some beer in the kitchen for Puffett." <==

"Yes, my lord."

Mr. Puffett, reminded that he was, in a manner of speaking, in the wrong
place, picked up his curly bowler and said heartily:

bonnet and shawl and we'll give these lads a 'and outside."

==> "Yes," said Harriet. "Bunter will be wanting you, Mrs. Ruddle, to see <==
about getting some lunch of some sort. Will you stay and have something
with us, Miss Twitterton?"

"Oh, no, really. I must be getting home. It's so good of you----"

"I know. Indeed, Miss Twitterton, it will be quite happy and safe with
me."

Miss Twitterton nodded, speechlessly; but any further demonstration was
==> cut short by the entrance of Bunter, who said, coming up to her: <==

"Excuse me. The furniture removers are about to clear the attics and
have desired me to inquire what is to be done with the various trunks
and articles labelled 'Twitterton'."

"Somebody," said Mr. Goodacre, "has been giving it too much water." He
looked accusingly from husband to wife.

"We haven't any of us touched it," said Harriet. She stopped,
==> remembering that Kirk and Bunter had handled it. But they were scarcely <==
likely to have watered it.

"I'm a humane man," began Peter, "and though I don't _like_ the prickly
brute----"

To be interrupted at a crisis had become so much a feature of daily life
==> at Talboys that Harriet felt no surprise to see Bunter enter upon these <==
words, as upon a cue. Behind him hovered the forms of Puffett and
Crutchley.

"If it will not inconvenience your lordship, the men are anxious to get
these pieces of furniture out."

waved a fat hand persuasively towards the sideboard, which was a massive
dresser, made all in one piece and extremely heavy.

"All right," said Peter; "but be quick. Take them and go."

==> Bunter and Puffett seized upon the near end of the dresser, which came <==
staggering away from the wall, its back festooned with cobwebs.
Crutchley seized the far end and backed with it to the door.

"Yes," continued Mr. Goodacre, whose mind, once it fastened on anything,
clung to it with the soft tenacity of a sea-anemone "Yes. I suppose the

"About four inches higher. You're sure?"

"Oh, yes, quite. Yes--and the----"

==> Through the unguarded door came Bunter once more, armed with a <==
clothes-brush. He made for Peter, seized him from behind and began to
brush the dust from his trousers. Mr. Goodacre, much interested, watched
the process.

"Ah!" he said, dodging out of the way as Puffett and Crutchley came in

"Ah!" he said, dodging out of the way as Puffett and Crutchley came in
to remove the settle nearest the window--"that's the worst of those
heavy old sideboards. It's so difficult to clean behind them. My wife
always complains about ours."

==> "That'll do, Bunter. Can't I be dusty if I like?" <==

Bunter smiled gently and began on the other leg.

"I am afraid," went on the vicar, "I should give your excellent man many
hours of distress if I were his employer. I am always being scolded for

"That'll do, Bunter. Can't I be dusty if I like?"

"I am afraid," went on the vicar, "I should give your excellent man many
hours of distress if I were his employer. I am always being scolded for
my untidiness." Out of the tail of his eye he saw the door shut behind

my untidiness." Out of the tail of his eye he saw the door shut behind
the other two men, and his mind, lagging behind his vision, made a
sudden bound to catch up with it. "Wasn't that Crutchley? We ought to
have asked him----"

==> "Bunter," said Peter, "you heard what I said. If Mr. Goodacre likes, you <==
can brush him. I will _not_ be brushed. I refuse."

He spoke with more sharpness, under his light tone, than Harriet had
ever heard him use. She thought: "For the first time since we were
married he has forgotten my existence." She went over to the coat he had

He spoke with more sharpness, under his light tone, than Harriet had

head.

Bunter, without a word, went to brush the vicar, and Peter, released,
walked straight up to the fireplace. Here he stopped, and his eye
searched the room.

"If I'd had more inches," said Peter, regretfully (for his height was a
sensitive point with him), "I might have had more brains. Better late

terms of the progression--if we could fill in the middle terms."

"Yes, my lord," agreed Bunter, in a colourless voice. His heart had

companion of a hundred cases--the appeal had been to him. He coughed.

Goodacre--I didn't think I should see you again. It _is_ nice to think
you're having Uncle William's cactus."

steps and his five-foot nine was an effectual screen to her four-foot
eight. "Miss Twitterton, if you've really finished, I wonder if you
would do something for me?"

"But of _course_--if I _can_!"

"It's extraordinarily kind of you," said Peter. He manœuvred her gently
to the door, opened it for her, and shut it after her. Harriet said
nothing. She knew where Peter's pen was, for she had seen it in the
inner breast pocket of his coat when she was looking for cigarettes, and
==> she felt a cold weight at the pit of her stomach. Bunter, who had <==
slipped quickly down from the steps, stood, chain in hand, as though
ready to put the gyves on a felon when he heard the word. Peter came
back with urgency in his step.

"Four inches difference, my lord."

though she had been his footman. "Here, you, go and fasten the door at
the top of the back stair. Don't let her hear you if you can help it.
Here are the house-keys. Lock the doors, front and back. Make sure that
Ruddle and Puffett and Crutchley are all inside. If anyone says

Harriet was out of the room, and tip-toeing along the passage. Voices in
the kitchen and a subdued clinking told her that lunch was being got

Back in the passage now...and quietly past that open door. Nobody seemed
to take any notice. She locked the front door, and the house was fast,
as it had been on the night of the murder.

She returned to the sitting-room, and found she had been so quick that

"Tom Puffett!" exclaimed the vicar. "Oh, I should not like to think that

"Fetch him here," said Peter.

==> Bunter was off the steps before he spoke. "Yes, my lord," he said, and <==
was gone like lightning. Harriet's eye fell on the chain, which lay,
where Bunter had left it, on top of the cabinet. She picked it up and
the clink of the links caught Peter's ear.

"Yes. The gun dislodged the chain. If Noakes had kept his chimneys

doing evil that good may come?"

Mr. Goodacre was spared discussion of this doctrinal point by the

"Did you want me, my lord?"

"Yes, Puffett. When you were clearing up this room on Wednesday morning

thought so--yes."

He threaded one end of the line through one of the rings at the lip of
the pot, brought the two ends with their sinkers together and handed

passed the double line over the hook in the ceiling.

"Very easily," said Peter. "That's what I was thinking." He walked
backwards towards the radio cabinet, keeping the double string taut in
his hand.

"I can feel it," said Peter, grimly. "How did you come not to notice its
weight when you and Kirk were examining it? It's been loaded with
something--lead shot from the feel of it. This must have been planned
some time ago."

jammed close against the end of the settle, over which the thin black
line stretched taut and nearly invisible to the hook in the beam.

A sharp knock on the window made them all start. Kirk and Sellon stood
outside, beckoning excitedly. Peter walked quickly across and opened the

quietly back against the wall.

"Yes?" said Peter.

"Frank Crutchley, I arrest you..."

The rest of the words were lost in the prisoner's frenzied shouting.
Harriet went over and stood by the window. Peter had not moved. He left
==> Bunter and Puffett to help the police. Even with this assistance, they <==
had their work cut out to drag Crutchley from the room.

"Dear me!" said Mr. Goodacre. "This is a most shocking thing." He picked
up his surplice and stole.

left them alone.

Harriet looked round the empty sitting-room with a curiously blank
sensation. There was nothing to sit on except the window-sill, so she
==> sat on that. Bunter was upstairs, locking trunks and suit-cases. Peter <==
walked aimlessly up and down the room.

"I'm going up to Town," he said abruptly. He looked vaguely at Harriet.
"I don't know what you'd care to do."

"Resourceful woman! We'll go to Town, then, and wait upon the event."

"I suppose you have no idea what his lordship is likely to decide?"

"No, my lady, I regret to say I have not."

==> For nearly twenty years, Bunter had known no plans which did not include <==
the Piccadilly flat; and he was for once at a loss.

"I'll tell you what," said Harriet. "Go up to the vicarage and ask Mrs.
Goodacre from me whether we may leave it with her for a few days till we
have made our plans. She can then send it on, carriage forward. Make

an excellent arrangement."

One felt rather shabby, perhaps, for not going to say _au revoir_ to the
Goodacres. But, quite apart from what Peter might or might not want, the
thought of Mrs. Goodacre's questions and Mr. Goodacre's lamentations was
==> a daunting one. When Bunter returned, bringing a cordial note of assent <==
from the vicar's wife, he reported that Miss Twitterton was also at the
parsonage, and Harriet was more than ever thankful to have escaped.

Mrs. Ruddle seemed to have disappeared. (She and Bert were, indeed,

Miraculously, the answer had been the right one. She said. "Yes; let's
do that." They found a taxi. Peter gave it the address of the garage
where they had left the car and they trundled away through the silent
streets.

"He's gone on down by train, with a message to say we might be a little
late."

"Will your mother mind?"

"Baths," said Peter, "real baths are definitely a good idea." They
walked along a wide landing, with aquatints along the wall, and two or
three tables in Queen Anne Chinoiserie, with Famille Rose jars upon

got up very early or never gone to bed, for he was dressed with an
impeccability worthy of Inigo Jones. Franklin, also impeccable, but
slightly flurried in her manner, arrived almost at the same moment. The
grateful sound of running water broke refreshingly upon the ear. The

voices--then silence. Then, unheralded by so much as a shuffle on the
stair, came Bunter's soft tap at the little door.

==> "Well, Bunter?" <==

"Very good, my lady. Would your ladyship like me to bring you a cup of

He was unspeakably relieved to see the taxi arrive and to assure himself
that there was no newspaper man perched on the spare wheel, or lurking
in a following vehicle.

"Here we are, Bunter. All serene? Good man. I'll drive. Sure you won't
==> be cold, Harriet?" <==

Mr. Bunter tucked a rug about the bride's knees.

"Your lordship will bear in mind that we are conveying the port?"

"A few grains of cereal, my lord. I have taken the liberty of removing
approximately a pound and three-quarters from among the hand-luggage,
together with a quantity of assorted footgear."

==> "That must have been Lord Saint-George," said Harriet. <==

"Presumably so, my lady."

"_My lady_"--she had never really thought it possible that Bunter would
accept the situation. Everybody else, perhaps, but not Bunter. Yet

    "_My lady gave me a tiger,_
    _A sleek and splendid tiger,_
    _A striped and shining tiger,_
    _All under the leaves of life._"

==> Nobody else, thought Harriet, had apparently suspected the tiger--except <==
of course, old Paul Delagardie, whose ironic eyes saw everything.

Peter's final comment had been:

"I have now completely given myself away. No English vocabulary. No

"The vibration is at present negligible, my lord."

That led memory farther back.

==> "This question of children, Harriet. Do you feel strongly about it?" <==

"Well, I'm not quite sure. I'm not marrying you for the sake of having
them, if that's what you mean."

"Thank Heaven! He does not wish to regard himself, nor yet to be

"Oh!" he had said, unexpectedly disconcerted. "I see. That's rather----
Have you ever considered what kind of a father I should make?"

"I know quite well. Casual, apologetic, reluctant and adorable."

==> "If I was reluctant, Harriet, it would only be because I have a profound <==
distrust of myself. Our family's been going a pretty long time. There's
Saint-George, who has no character, and his sister, with no vitality--to
say nothing of the next heir after Saint-George and myself, who is a
third cousin and completely gaga. And if you think about my own compound
of what Uncle Paul calls nerves and nose----"

"I am reminded of what Clare Clairemont said to Byron: 'I shall always
remember the gentleness of your manners and the wild originality of your
countenance.'"

==> "No, Harriet--I mean that." <==

"Your brother married his own cousin. Your sister married a commoner and
_her_ children are all right. You wouldn't be doing it all yourself, you
know--_I'm_ common enough. What's wrong with _me_?"

==> "Nothing, Harriet. That's true. By God, that's true. The fact is, I'm a <==
coward about responsibility and always have been. My dear--if you want

herself in cloth of gold and a soft fur cloak, and Peter, absurdly
upright in morning dress, with a gardenia in his lapel, balancing a silk
hat on his knee.

"No more than when we went up the Cherwell that night and moored on the
far bank, and you asked the same question."

"Thank God! Stick to it, sweetheart. Only one more river."

with home-cured hams. Only, Darby and Joan were dead by now, and Noakes
(she vaguely remembered him--a hard-faced, grasping man who hired out
bicycles) would be waiting to receive them. But--there was no light in
any of the windows at Talboys.

==> "We're a bit late," said Harriet, nervously; "he may have given us up." <==

"Then we shall firmly hand ourselves back to him," said Peter,
cheerfully. "People like you and me are not so easily got rid of. I told
him, any time after eight o'clock. This looks like the gate."

"H'm!" said Peter. "The occupier, I gather, has already taken his

"He's probably deputed somebody else. He didn't write this himself--he
can spell 'notice' in his letter to us. The 'somebody' is a little
lacking in thought not to realise that _we_ might want bread and milk.
However, we can remedy the matter."

Mr. Bunter, gloomily self-restrained, grasped the heavy knocker and let
its summons thunder through the night. The dog barked again. He tried
the handle, but the door was fast.

This, she felt, was her fault. Her idea in the first place. Her house.
Her honeymoon. Her--and this was the incalculable factor in the
thing--her husband. (A repressive word, that, when you came to think of
it, compounded of a grumble and a thump.) The man in possession. The man

The fusillade of knocks had begun again, and the dog was growing
hysterical.

guilt that no embraces could stifle, "because, if not----"

"If not... Last night you slept in a goosefeather bed, and all that. But

myself on anyone for very long together. Except Bunter, of course. Have
you consulted Bunter? Do you think he would give me a good character?"

==> "It sounds to me," said Harriet, "as though Bunter had picked up a girl <==
friend."

The footsteps of two people were, in fact, approaching from behind the
house. Somebody was expostulating with Bunter in high-pitched tones:

The speaker, now emerging into the blaze of the headlights, was a
hard-faced angular lady of uncertain age, dressed in a mackintosh, a
knitted shawl, and a man's cap secured rakishly to her head with knobbed
and shiny hatpins. Neither the size of the car, the polish of its
chromium plating nor the brilliance of its lamps appeared to impress
==> her, for advancing with a snort to Harriet's side she said, <==
belligerently:

"Now then, 'oo are you and wot d'you want, kicking up all this noise?
Let's 'ave a look at yer!"

"By all means," said Peter. He switched on the dashboard light. His
yellow hair and his eye-glass seemed to produce an unfortunate
impression.

"H'mph!" said the lady. "Film-actors, by the look of yer. And" (with a
==> withering glance at Harriet's furs) "no better than you should be, I'll <==
be bound."

"We are very sorry to have disturbed you," began Peter, "Mrs.--er----"

"Ruddle is my name," said the lady of the cap. "Mrs. Ruddle, and a

==> "Ruddle?" said Harriet. "Didn't he work at one time for Mr. Vickey at <==
Five Elms?"

"Yes, 'e did," said Mrs. Ruddle, quickly, "but that's fifteen year
agone. I lost Ruddle last Michaelmas five year, and a good 'usband 'e

Broxford 'e was, by the ten o'clock bus Wednesday night, and never said
nothing to nobody, not to mention leave me my week's money."

==> "But," said Harriet, "if you do his cleaning, haven't you got a key to <==
the house?"

"No, I have _not_," replied Mrs. Ruddle. "You don't ketch _'im_ givin'
me no keys. Afraid I'll pinch sommink, I suppose. Not that _'e_ leaves

Do you think she could let us have a loaf of bread and some butter?"

at Bunter--"but _I_ didn't pay no 'eed to 'im. Begging your pardon, mum,

"Yes, my lady. Thank you, my lady."

"After which," said Peter, when they had reversed through the gate and

have him to dinner one day and he'll tell you how he did it. He started
in the War, with the double handicap of a slight deformity and a German
name, but before he dies he'll be a damn' sight richer than I am."

==> Harriet asked a question or two, which her husband answered, but in so <==
abstracted a tone that she realised he was giving only about a quarter
of his mind to the virtuous Jew of London and none of it to herself. He
was probably mulling over the mysterious behaviour of Mr. Noakes. She
was quite accustomed to his sudden withdrawals into the recesses of his
own mind, and did not resent them. She had known him stop short in the

If you could wait five--or perhaps _ten_--minutes while I made a more
suitable toilet, I could come now--as I see you have your beautiful

==> "Please don't bother, Miss Twitterton," said Harriet, a little alarmed <==
at the prospect. "We have plenty of supplies with us and Mrs. Ruddle and
our man can look after us quite well for to-night. If you could just let
us have the keys----"

"The keys--yes, of course. So _dreadful_ for you not being able to get

_will_ take a little bit of cake and a glass of my home-made wine?"

Twitterton was already hunting in a cupboard. Behind her back, Peter put
his hands to his face in a mute gesture of horrified resignation.

"There!" said Miss Twitterton, triumphantly. "I'm sure you will feel
better for a little refreshment. My parsnip wine is really _extra_ good

isn't very often, I'm pleased to say, because my health is always
_remarkably_ good."

"That will not prevent me from drinking to it," said Peter, disposing of
the parsnip wine with a celerity which might have been due to eagerness
==> but, to Harriet, rather suggested a reluctance to let the draught linger <==
on the palate. "May I pour out a glass for yourself?"

"How kind of you!" cried Miss Twitterton. "Well--it's _rather_ late at
night--but I really _ought_ to drink to your wedded happiness, oughtn't
I?--_Not_ too much, Lord Peter, please. The dear Vicar always says my

"Peter, my poor, long-suffering, heroic lamb--pour it into the
aspidistra."

Wimsey lifted his eyebrows at the plant.

better of the two. Here goes. But you might kiss me to take the taste
away.... Our hostess has a certain refinement (I think that's the word)

which is unusual. Her life has had some smatch of honour in it. Who was
her father?"

"I must apologise for Uncle. I really _cannot_ understand _his_ treating
you in this _cavalier_ way. I _do_ hope you'll find everything all
right. Mrs. Ruddle is _not_ very intelligent."

==> Harriet assured Miss Twitterton that Bunter would see to everything, and <==
they succeeded at length in extricating themselves. Their return to
Talboys was remarkable only for Peter's observing that unforgettable was
the epithet for Miss Twitterton's parsnip wine and that if one was going
to be sick on one's wedding night one might just as well have done it
between Southampton and Le Havre.

m'lord." Here Mrs. Ruddle dropped something like a curtsy.

The sitting-room was, indeed, "brighter" than the kitchen. Two ancient
oak-settles, flanking the chimney-piece at right angles, and an
old-fashioned American eight-day clock on the inner wall, were all that
==> remained of the old farmhouse furniture that Harriet remembered. The <==
flame of the kitchen candle, which Mrs. Ruddle had lit, danced
flickeringly over a suite of Edwardian chairs with crimson upholstery, a
top-heavy sideboard, a round mahogany table with wax fruit on it, a
bamboo what-not with mirrors and little shelves sprouting from it in all
directions, a row of aspidistras in pots in the window-ledge, with

wishful to please, brass knobs it was, beautiful."

with the four-poster stripped naked and the rugs rolled together and
emitting a powerful odour of mothballs.

"That it is, m'lady," said Mrs. Ruddle. "Not but what some o' the
visitors likes these old-fashioned things--quaint, they calls 'em--and

at an old-fashioned nightshirt laid ready for use on the bed and at the
shaving tackle and sponge on the washstand.

summer visitors--"_down_ this 'ere little stair--mind yer 'ead,
mum--everythink is modern, put in by Mr. Noakes w'en 'e took to lettin'

"Well, no, m'lady, not a _bath_room" replied Mrs. Ruddle, as though that
were too much to expect, "but everythink else is quite modern as you'll
find--only requirin' to be pumped up night and morning in the scullery."

thought, a little worn, and she smiled deprecatingly at him.

"Thank you, Bunter. I'm afraid this is making a lot of work for you. Is

he rather thought they were having a little difficulty with the
sitting-room fire, and he would like to get his lordship's suit-case
unpacked before going down to give an eye to it.

==> Under the circumstances, Harriet made no attempt to change her dress. <==
The room, though spacious and beautiful in its half-timbered style, was
cold. She wondered whether, all things considered, Peter would not have
been happier in the Hotel Gigantic somewhere-or-other on the Continent.
She hoped that, after his struggles with the woodshed, he would find a
good, roaring fire to greet him and be able to eat his belated meal in

smoke came a figure that he vaguely remembered promising to love and
cherish at some earlier period in the day. Her eyes were streaming and
her progress blind. He extended an arm, and they coughed convulsively
together.

==> "Oh, Peter!" said Harriet. "I think all the chimneys are bewitched." <==

The windows in the sitting-room had been opened and the draught brought
fresh smoke billowing out into the passage. With it came Bunter,
staggering but still in possession of his faculties, and flung wide both
the front door and the back. Harriet reeled out into the sweet cold air

see and breathe again, she made her way back to the sitting-room, only
to meet Peter coming out of the kitchen in his shirt-sleeves.

"It's no go," said his lordship. "No can do. Those chimneys are blocked.

Elizabeth. He had consequently succeeded in kindling upon the
hearth-stone a small fire of wood which, though restricted in size and
scope by the absence of dogs, would, he trusted, somewhat mitigate the
inclemency of the atmosphere.

==> "Bunter," said Harriet, "you are marvellous." <==

"Bunter," said Wimsey, "you are becoming thoroughly demoralised. I told
you to look after _yourself_. This is the first time you have ever
refused to take my orders. I hope you will not make it a precedent."

for to-morrow, subject to her ladyship's approval. Her manner is
unpolished, but I have observed that her brass is not and that she has
hitherto maintained the house in a state of commendable cleanliness.
Unless your ladyship desires to make other arrangements----"

==> "Let's keep her on if we can," said Harriet, a little confused at being <==
deferred to (since Bunter, after all, was likely to suffer most from
Mrs. Ruddle's peculiarities). "She's always worked here and she knows
where everything is, and she seems to be doing her best."

She glanced doubtfully at Peter, who said:

with the photography of deceased persons in an imperfect state of

He paused, and seemed to expect something.

"No, my lady--the housemaid; the kitchen-maid having been sent out for
giggling when Miss Franklin was speaking."

"It's a pity we let Mrs. Ruddle go," said Peter. "In her absence we will

"You'll have to reply to it, Peter."

"I am no orator as Bunter is, but I'll try.... Am I mistaken, by the
way, in imagining that that oil-stove is stinking to heaven?"

==> "It's smoking, at any rate," said Harriet, "like nothing on earth." <==

Bunter, whose back was towards it, got up in alarm.

"I fear, my lord," he observed, after some minutes of silent struggle,
"that some catastrophe has occurred to the burner."

"Oh!" said Peter, a little blankly.

And indeed, when they reached the sitting-room, Beatrice was seen to be
at her last expiring blue glimmer.

suggestion.

"Very good, my lady."

"At any rate," said Peter, lighting the cigarettes, "the matches still

"No. Yes. Kiss me again."

It was at some point during the next five minutes that Peter was heard
to murmur, "Not faint Canaries but ambrosial"; and it is symptomatic of
==> Harriet's state of mind that at the time she vaguely connected the faint <==
canaries with the shabby tigers--only tracing the quotation to its
source some ten days later.

Bunter came downstairs. In one hand he held a small and steaming jug,
and in the other a case of razors and a sponge-bag. A bath-towel and a

The wood upon the hearth was flaring cheerfully, and the water, what
there was of it, was boiling. The two brass candlesticks bore their
flaming ministers bravely, one on either side of the mirror. The big
four-poster, with its patchwork quilt of faded blues and scarlets and
its chintz hangings dimmed by age and laundering, had, against the pale,
==> plastered walls, a dignified air as though of exiled royalty. Harriet, <==
warm and powdered and free at last from the smell of soot, paused with
the hair-brush in her hand to wonder what was happening to Peter. She
slipped across the chill dark of the dressing-room, opened the farther
door, and listened. From somewhere far below came an ominous clank of

slipped across the chill dark of the dressing-room, opened the farther
door, and listened. From somewhere far below came an ominous clank of
iron, followed by a loud yelp and a burst of half-suffocated laughter.

==> "Poor darling!" said Harriet.... <==

She put out the bedroom candles. The sheets, worn thin by age, were of
fine linen, and somewhere in the room there was a scent of lavender....
Jordan river.... A branch broke and fell upon the hearth in a shower of
sparks, and the tall shadows danced across the ceiling.

As though this disturbing thought had broken his sleep, he stirred at
that moment, and, without opening his eyes, felt for her with his hand
and pulled her down against him. And his first word was neither French
nor English, but a long interrogative "M'mmm?"

==> "M'm!" said Harriet, abandoning herself. "_Mais quel tact, mon dieu! <==
Sais-tu enfin qui je suis?_"

"Yes, my Shulamite, I do, so you needn't lay traps for my tongue. In the
course of a mis-spent life I have learnt that it is a gentleman's first

In nothing has the whirligig of time so redressed the balance between
the sexes as in this business of getting up in the morning. Woman, when
not an adept of the Higher Beauty Culture, has now little to do beyond
washing, stepping into a garment or so, and walking downstairs. Man,
still slave to the button and the razor, clings to the ancient
==> ceremonial of potter and gets himself up by instalments. Harriet was <==
knotting her tie before the sound of splashing was heard in the next
room. She accordingly classed her new possession as a confirmed potterer
and made her way down by what Peter, with more exactness than delicacy,
had already named the Privy Stair. This led into a narrow passage,
containing the modern convenience before-mentioned, a boot-hole and a

small cold-house sheltering a hardy vine with half a dozen bunches of
black grapes on it and a number of half-hardy plants in pots. In front
of the house, a good show of dahlias and chrysanthemums and a bed of
scarlet salvias lent colour to the sunshine. Mr. Noakes apparently had
some little taste for gardening, or at any rate a good gardener; and
==> this was the pleasantest thing yet known of Mr. Noakes, thought Harriet. <==
She explored the potting-shed, where the tools were in good order, and
found a pair of scissors, armed with which she made an assault upon the
long trail of vine-leaves and the rigid bronze sheaves of the
chrysanthemums. She grinned a little to find herself thus supplying the
statutory "feminine touch" to the household and, looking up, was

At the other side of the casement, come from goodness knew where, was a
large ginger cat, engaged in thoroughly licking one fore-paw before
applying it to the back of its ear. The two sleek animals, delicately
self-absorbed, sat on in a mandarin-like calm till the human one, with
the restlessness of inferiority, lifted his eyes from his task, caught
==> sight of Harriet and said "Hey!"--whereupon the cat rose up, affronted, <==
and leapt out of sight.

"That," said Peter, who had sometimes an uncanny way of echoing one's

_Parturiunt montes_. At any rate, the creation seems to be groaning and
travailing together a good deal."

a garden label.

a sniff. "Says 'e can see well enough by candlelight. Comes cheaper, I

The gardener, hesitating now at the door of the room with his face to

thirty, neatly dressed in a suit of working clothes and carrying his cap
respectfully in his hand. His crisp dark hair, blue eyes and strong
white teeth produced a favourable impression, though at the moment he

gathered that he had overheard her panegyric of him and disapproved of
it.

"Not him. He's not the sort to tell more than he has to. Matter of fact,

eye and smiled in some embarrassment.

"All right," said his lordship. "We'll talk it over presently.
Meanwhile, carry on with whatever it is you do on Wednesdays." Whereupon

school-marming seemed to have got into Miss Twitterton's blood and that
nothing was so exasperating to the male sex in general as an attitude of
mingled reproof and showmanship.

nose from the middle of a clump of dahlias and cast a vague glance

she thought, had not changed much in the last seventeen years. He was a
little greyer, a little thinner, a little baggier about the knees and
shoulders, but in essentials the same Mr. Goodacre she and her father
had occasionally encountered in the old days, visiting the sick of
Paggleham. It was clear that he had not the faintest recollection of

who, from his point of vantage upon the step-ladder, was indulging in
what seemed to her to be an unbecoming kind of grimace over the heads of
his employers. The young man instantly became unnaturally grave and gave
his attention to mopping up the water which, in his momentary

observing:

"We have been married nearly twenty-four hours, and are still married;

The vicar, who had seemed doubtful whether to be amused or distressed by
the first part of this remark, at once looked all eager interest, and
==> Harriet hastened to explain who she was and what had brought them to <==
Talboys. If Mr. Goodacre had ever heard or read anything of the murder
trial, he showed no sign of such knowledge; he merely expressed the
greatest delight at meeting Dr. Vane's daughter once more and at
welcoming two new parishioners to his fold.

and I can do, Lady Peter, I hope you will not hesitate to make use of
us."

==> "It's awfully good of you," said Harriet. "But really, _we_ are quite <==
all right. It's rather fun, picnicking like this. Only, of course, Miss
Twitterton is anxious about her uncle."

"No doubt he has been detained somewhere," said the vicar. "Or"--a

once bringing it over to Great Pagford for a great combined Armistice
Thanksgiving? I sat beside you at the Rectory tea, and we discussed
Church music very seriously. Do you still do dear old Bunnett in F?"

to look at the programme of the concert. Dear me!" His face lit up with
a childlike pleasure. "Do you know, it is quite a long time since I

crackled between the vicar's fingers. Miss Twitterton awestruck and
open-mouthed; Mr. Puffett suddenly pausing in mid-action, sponge in

"Shenandoah," "Rio Grande," "Down in Demerara." He glanced round the
dust-sheeted room. "That's exactly how we feel. That's the song for us,

          _"Here we sit like birds in the wilderness----"_

All mad together, thought Harriet, joining in:

          _"Birds in the wilderness----"_

Mr. Puffett could not bear it and exploded with a roar:

vicar should, to deal with this emergency occurring in his parish. "A
friend of mine had sad trouble with corroded soot. But I was able to
assist him with an old-fashioned remedy. I wonder now--I wonder--is Mrs.
Ruddle here? The invaluable Mrs. Ruddle?"

==> Harriet, receiving no guidance from Peter's politely impassive <==
expression, went to summon Mrs. Ruddle, of whom the vicar instantly took
charge.

"Ah, good morning, Martha. Now, I wonder if you could borrow your son's
old shot-gun for us. The one he uses for scaring the birds."

"I could pop over and see, sir," said Mrs. Ruddle, dubiously.

"Let Crutchley go for you," suggested Peter. He turned abruptly as he
==> spoke and began to fill his pipe. Harriet, studying his face, saw with <==
apprehension that he was brimming over with an awful anticipatory glee.
Whatever cataclysm impended, he would not put out a finger to stop it,
he would let the heavens fall and tread the antic hay on the ruins.

"Well," conceded Mrs. Ruddle, "Frank's quicker on his feet nor what I

"But, Mr. Goodacre," exclaimed Miss Twitterton anxiously, "are you
_sure_ it's quite safe? I'm always very nervous about guns in the house.
All these accidents----"

==> The vicar reassured her. Harriet, perceiving that the owners of the <==
house, at any rate, were to be relieved of all responsibility for their
own chimneys, nevertheless thought it well to placate the sweep.

"Don't desert us, Mr. Puffett," she pleaded. "One can't hurt Mr.
Goodacre's feelings. But if anything happens----"

twin grey lakes of limpid clarity and wholly deceptive depth.

"Well," said Mr. Puffett, slowly, "anything to oblige. But don't say I
didn't warn you, m'lord. It's a thing I don't 'old with."

==> "It won't bring the chimney down, will it?" inquired Harriet. <==

"Oh, it won't bring the _chimney_ down," replied Mr. Puffett. "If you
likes to 'umour the old gentleman, on your 'ead be it. In a manner of
speaking, m'lady."

dear! Oh, Frank! Oh, goodness!"

"I knew it!" said Peter. "Whoop! I knew it! You blasphemed the
aspidistra and something awful _has_ come down that chimney!"

"Peter! it's Mr. Goodacre in the sheet."

with his hands and fumbled for his glasses. "I trust the ladies were not
unduly alarmed by the explosion. It appears to have been effective."

"Remarkably so," said Peter. He pulled a pampas grass from the
==> drain-pipe and poked delicately among the debris, while Harriet, <==
flicking soot from the vicar, was reminded of Alice dusting the White
King. "It's surprising, the things you find in old chimneys."

"No dead bodies, I trust," said the vicar.

me!"

==> "My husband will be delighted," said Harriet. She was wickedly tempted <==
to add, "He knows _everything_ about business," but was fortunately
forestalled by the gentleman himself.

"Nothing delights me more," pronounced his lordship, "than minding other
people's business. Show him in. And, Bunter! Allow me to invest you with

"Yes. Before you go--take up the bodies. But the soldiers may be excused
from shooting. We have had enough of that for one morning."

Mr. Bunter bowed, collected the skeletons in the dust-pan and departed.
==> But as he passed behind the settle, Harriet saw him unwind the chain and <==
drop it unobtrusively into the drain-pipe, setting the roasting-jack
upright against the wall. A gentleman might have his joke; but a
gentleman's gentleman has his position to keep up. One could not face
inquisitive Hebrews in the character of Mayor of Paggleham and
Provincial Grand Master of the Most Heroic Order of the Chimney.

"Gone away," explained Mr. MacBride. "Vamoosed. Done a bunk. Skipped
with the cash. Is that clear enough? If I've said it to Mr. Abrahams
once, I've said it a thousand times. If you don't come down sharp on

"It'll do you good."

"Oh, _do_ you, Lady Peter? Well--if you insist---- Only sherry, then,
and only a _little_ of that---- Of course, it isn't really so early any
longer, is it?--Oh, please, really, I'm sure you're giving me _far_ too

remark:

"You are a master of meiosis."

==> "Thank you, Harriet. What's your poison, padre?" <==

"Sherry, thank you, sherry. Your health, my dear young people." He
clinked the tumbler solemnly against Miss Twitterton's mug, taking her
by surprise. "Take courage, Miss Twitterton. Things mayn't be as bad as
they seem."

and laid a hand on his arm.

voice, "don't say you've found---- Where? Down the cellar?"

Miss Twitterton, unexpectedly quick-witted, sprang to her feet. "He's
dead! Uncle's dead!" The mug rolled from her hands to crash on the
hearth-stone.

"Oh, no, impossible," said Mr. Goodacre. He looked appealingly at
Bunter, who bent his head.

"I am very much afraid so, sir."

Crutchley, who recoiled with a gasp, broke from the vicar's supporting
==> hand and flung herself hysterically into Harriet's arms. <==

"Here!" said Mr. Puffett, "let's 'ave a look."

He made for the door, cannoning into Crutchley. Bunter profited by the
confusion to fling the door to and set his back against it.

"I couldn't say, my lord; but it looks most unpleasantly like it."

"Take this and pull yourself together. Then run over to the cottage and
get this chap Sellon or whatever his name is. Quick."

She let them go and turned to Peter, who stood motionless, staring down
at the table. Oh, my God! she thought, startled by his face, he's a
middle-aged man--the half of life gone--he mustn't----

our house, so we put on a collar and tie. Nothing could be more obvious.
How absurd men are! And how clever in devising protective armour for
themselves! What kind of tie will it be? Black would surely be
excessive. Dull purple or an unobtrusive spot? No. A regimental tie.
Nothing could be more proper. Purely official and committing one to

"That's the point. Supposing I'd come here to disport myself with

as anyone else, if I put my mind to it. But as things are, no! Nothing
that you or I have done is any insult to death--unless you think so,

In the short time that they had been upstairs, Mr. Puffett had evidently
finished his chimney-sweeping, for the sitting-room had been cleared of
dust-sheets and a fire kindled upon the hearth. A table had been drawn
out into the centre of the room; on it stood a tray filled with plates
==> and cutlery. Passing through into the passage, Harriet was aware of a <==
good deal of activity in progress. Before the shut door of the cellar
stood the uniformed figure of P.C. Sellon, like young Harry with his
beaver on, prepared to resist any interference with the execution of his
duty. In the kitchen, Mrs. Ruddle was cutting sandwiches. In the
scullery, Crutchley and Mr. Puffett were clearing a quantity of pots and

"That'll be the police," said Peter. He went to let them in, and at the

door sharply.

eat----?"

"Yes, my lady. I succeeded in intercepting the Home & Colonial and
procuring some ham for sandwiches. There is also a portion of the _foie

"Very naturally, my lady, if I may say so.... The scullery," went on
Bunter, with a touch of hesitation, "appeared a more suitable place than
the kitchen for--ah--the medical gentleman to work in."

==> "Certainly," said Harriet, with emphasis. <==

"Yes, my lady. I inquired of his lordship whether, in view of all the
circumstances, he would desire me to order in any coal. He said he would
refer the matter to your ladyship."

The police party had been taken into the sitting-room. Through the
half-open door one could hear Peter's high, fluent voice giving a lucid
account of the whole incredible business, with patient pauses for
interrogation or to allow a deliberate constabulary pencil to catch up
==> with him. Harriet sighed angrily. <==

"I do wish he hadn't to be worried like this! It's too bad."

"Yes, my lady." Bunter's face stirred, as though some human emotion were
trying to break through. He made no further comment, but something which

"I do wish he hadn't to be worried like this! It's too bad."

"Yes, my lady." Bunter's face stirred, as though some human emotion were
trying to break through. He made no further comment, but something which
==> Harriet recognised as sympathy seemed to waft out of him. She said <==
impulsively:

"I wonder. Do you think I'm right in ordering the coal?"

It was scarcely fair to push Bunter on to such delicate ground. He

"Certainly, my lady."

The men were coming out of the sitting-room. They were introduced: Dr.
Craven, Superintendent Kirk, Sergeant Blades. The cellar door was
opened; somebody produced an electric torch and they all went down.
==> Harriet, relegated to the woman's rôle of silence and waiting, went into <==
the kitchen to help with the sandwiches. The rôle, though dull, was not
a useless one, for Mrs. Ruddle, with a large knife in her hand, was
standing at the scullery door as though prepared to carry out a
butcherly kind of post-mortem upon whatever might be brought up from the
cellar.

dessay, without you goin' an' twistin' it all up afore they gets it,' I
says. So 'e says----"

There was a peculiar mixture of malice and triumph in Mrs. Ruddle's
==> voice which Harriet felt the episode of the hens did not altogether <==
account for. But at this moment Bunter came in by the passage door.

"His lordship's compliments, my lady; and Superintendent Kirk would be
glad to see you for a moment in the sitting-room if you can spare the
time."

Superintendent Kirk was a large man with a mild and ruminative
expression. He seemed already to have obtained from Peter most of the
information he needed, asking only a few questions to confirm such
points as the time of the party's arrival at Talboys and the appearance
of the sitting-room and kitchen when they came in. What he really wanted
==> to get from Harriet was a description of the bedroom. All Mr. Noakes's <==
clothes had been there? His toilet articles? No suit-cases? No
suggestion that he intended to leave the house at once? No? Well, that
confirmed the idea that Mr. Noakes intended to get away, but was in no
immediate hurry. Not, for example, particularly expecting any unpleasant
interview that night. The Superintendent was much obliged to her

been broken by the blow. And with so many people in and out of the house
all night and morning, one could scarcely expect footprints or anything
like that. At any rate, nothing had been seen to suggest a struggle?
Nothing. Mr. Kirk was greatly obliged.

==> Harriet said, Not at all, and murmured something about lunch. The <==
Superintendent said he saw no objection to that; he had finished with
the sitting-room for the moment. He would just like a word with this
fellow MacBride about the financial side of the business, but he would
send him in as soon as he had done with him. He tactfully refused to
join the party, but accepted the offer of a mouthful of bread and cheese

the way."

He went out, leaving the atmosphere clearer, as though by the removal of
funeral flowers.

==> "I'm afraid that's true," said Harriet. <==

"Just as well, isn't it?" Wimsey's tone was studiously light. "When I'm
investigating a murder, I hate to have too much sympathy with the
corpse. Personal feelings cramp the style."

preposterously fond of a person didn't prevent one from hurting him
unintentionally. She had an uncomfortable feeling that his confidence
had been shaken and that this was not the end of the misunderstanding.

myself, what you need, Sam Kirk, is contact with a Great Mind or so,
after supper. Reading maketh a full man----"

"And writing an exact man," said the Superintendent. "Mind that, Joe
Sellon, and see you let me have them notes so as they can be read to
make sense."

"What's that?" said the Superintendent. "That's a new one on me. 'Garden
of bright images,' eh? That's pretty, that is."

"_Golden Hours of_," said Peter. "Ernest Bramah."

"Make a note o' that for me, will you, Joe? 'Bright images'--that's just

"They give us a lot of trouble, them fellows," said Mr. Kirk,
sympathetically.

our backs now."

"Ah!" said Mr. Kirk. "That's what comes of being a public character. You
can't escape the fierce light that beats upon----"

"Absolutely. The front we opened ourselves with the latch-key, and the
back--let me see----"

"Better have Bunter in," said Peter. "He'll know. He never forgets
anything." He called Bunter, adding, "What we want here is a bell."

"And you saw no disturbance, except what you've mentioned. Egg-shells

and such. No marks? No weapon? Nothing out of its place?"

much light, and, of course, we weren't looking for anything. We didn't
know there was anything to look for."

"Eh?" said the Superintendent. "Night's candles? _Romeo and Juliet_--not

when he was killed. After dark, that means."

"He died by candlelight. Sounds like the title of a high-brow thriller.

"Captain Cuttle," said Mr. Kirk, not to be caught napping again.

"All right, Bunter," said Peter, seeing that the Superintendent had
finished with him. "You can go."

"Hullo!" said Peter. "On the left, from behind downwards. That looks
like another of our old friends."

"Yes. It's surprising how often you get them in detective fiction. A
sort of sinister twist running right through the character."

"It might be a back-handed blow."

down and lose consciousness--concussed, as you might say. After a bit,
he'd come to, like as not. But he'd never know what hit 'im. Wouldn't
remember a thing about it."

==> "Nor he would," said Harriet, eagerly. She knew that bit--in fact she'd <==
had to expound it in her latest detective novel but one. "There'd be
complete forgetfulness of everything immediately preceding the blow. And
he might even pick himself up and feel all right for some time."

"Such as locking the door behind the murderer?"

"_Exactly_, there's the trouble."

==> "Then," pursued Harriet, "he'd get giddy and drowsy, wouldn't he? Wander <==
off to get a drink or call for help and----"

Memory suddenly showed her the open cellar-door, yawning between the
back-door and the scullery.

it. Hæmorrhagic effusion into the cortex. That's a good one."

"Bleeding in the brain," said Peter. "Good lord--he had plenty of time.
He may have been coshed outside the house altogether."

==> "But when do you suppose it all happened?" demanded Harriet. She <==
appreciated Peter's effort to exonerate the house from all share in the
crime, and was annoyed with herself for having betrayed any sensibility
on the subject. It was distracting for him. Her tone, in consequence,
was determinedly off-hand and practical.

that means---- H'm! We'd better have this chap Crutchley in. Seems like
he might have been the last person to see deceased alive."

"Enter the obvious suspect," said Peter, lightly.

==> "The obvious suspect is always innocent," said Harriet in the same tone. <==

"In books, my lady," said Mr. Kirk, with a little indulgent bow towards
her, as who should say, "The ladies. God bless them!"

"Come, come," said Peter, "we must not introduce our professional

might give me a bit of help, seeing as you know the ropes, so to speak.
Not but what it'll be a kind of busman's holiday for you," he finished
up, rather dubiously.

==> "That's what I was thinking," said Harriet. "A busman's honeymoon. <==
Butchered to make a----"

"Lord Byron!" cried Mr. Kirk, a little too promptly. "Butchered to make
a busman's--no, that don't seem right somehow."

"Cripes! you don't mean to tell me----"

"Oh, yes he had," said Kirk. This information, if he knew anything about
it, was going to loosen his witness's tongue for him and save a deal of
trouble. Crutchley turned with a frantic look to the other members of
==> the party. Peter confirmed Kirk's statement with a nod. Harriet, who had <==
known days when the loss of forty pounds would have meant greater
catastrophe than Peter could ever suffer by the loss of forty thousand,
said sympathetically:

"Yes, Crutchley. I'm afraid he had the money on him all the time."

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 128212    window = 128207 128217


"Well, we did," admitted the Superintendent. "There's no call to make a
secret of it." He waited for the witness to draw the obvious conclusion.

"Mean to say, if he hadn't been killed, I might have had my money?"

==> "If you could have got in before Mr. MacBride," said Harriet, with more <==
honesty than consideration for Kirk's tactics. Crutchley, however, was
not troubling his head about Mr. MacBride. The murderer was the man who
had robbed him of his own, and he took no pains to conceal his feelings.

"God! I'll--I'll--I'll--I'd like to----"

"Dunno," said Crutchley, thoughtfully. "Must a-been getting on for
twenty-past, I reckon. Anyway, it was ten past when I wound that there
clock. And it keeps good time."

==> "It's right now," said Kirk, glancing at his watch. Harriet's <==
wrist-watch confirmed this, and so did Joe Sellon's. Peter, after a
blank gaze at his own watch, said, "Mine's stopped," in a tone which
might have suggested that Newton's apple had been observed to fly upward
or a B.B.C. announcer heard to use a bawdy expression.

"I never forget to wind it up," said her husband, indignantly. "You're
quite right, though; I did. I must have been thinking of something else
last night."

his watch back into his pocket unwound and stared at the clock.

"Yes," he said, finally. "It was. I heard it ticking, when we were
sitting here. It was the most comfortable thing in the house."

==> "It was right, too," said Harriet. "Because you said something about its <==
being past midnight and I looked, and it said the same as my watch."

Peter said nothing, but whistled a couple of bars almost inaudibly.
Harriet remained imperturbable; twenty-four hours of matrimony had
taught her that, if one was going to be disturbed by sly allusions to

Greenland's coast or anything else, one might live in a state of
perpetual confusion.

Crutchley said:

Kirk opened his mouth to reprove the intruder, but was suddenly
overcome. "Black it stood as night," he muttered, joyfully. This new way
of applying quotations, not to edification, seemed to have caught his
fancy.

==> "Oh, dear," said Harriet. She glanced at Peter. "I wonder if we'd better <==
leave it till to-morrow?"

"I don't mind telling you, me lady," observed the sweep, "Mr. Bunter's
fair put out, thinkin' he'll have to cook dinner on that there perishin'
oil-stove."

not bear to see Bunter suffer any more. Besides, the men would probably
get on better without her. As she went out, she heard Kirk call Puffett
into the room.

"Just a moment," said Kirk. "Crutchley here says he was at choir

"Did she say anything particular, besides shrieking?"

Peter was conscious of a curious reluctance. Theoretically, he was quite
as ready to hang a woman as a man, but the memory of Miss Twitterton,
==> frenziedly clinging to Harriet, was disturbing to him. He was tempted to <==
feel, with Kirk, that marriage was a handicap to a young officer.

"See here, my lord," said Kirk, his ox-eyes mild but implacable, "I've
heard one or two things from these other people."


[line number in individual story] matching line = 5236    window = 5231 5241

some funny stuff on the side. I've known men get bumped off for other
things besides money. Well, so long. My respects to her ladyship, and
much obliged."

Bunter brought round the car and he hopped in, waving a friendly
==> gesture. Peter caught Harriet, and explained what was wanted. <==

"Poor little Twitters," said Harriet. "Are you going to be there?"

"No. I'm going out for a breath of air. I'll come back presently."


[line number in individual story] matching line = 5238    window = 5233 5243

things ain't done, they won't do 'em--and that's the long and the short
of it."

Having thus laid down the code of behaviour for the nobility and gentry,
Mr. Kirk blew his nose, and resumed his seat; whereupon the door opened
==> to admit Harriet and Mr. Goodacre. <==

The Rev. Simon Goodacre blinked nervously when confronted by the two

announcement on her way upstairs that he had "something to say to you,
Superintendent," did little to set him at ease.

"Dear me! Well. Yes. I came back to see if you wanted me for anything.
As you suggested, you know, as you suggested. And to tell Miss

them. It's a hard life," added Mr. Kirk, plaintively. "If you ask
questions, you tell the witness what you're after; if you don't ask 'em,
you can't find out anything. And just when you think you're getting on
to something you come slap up against the Judges' Rules."

==> "Yes, sir," said Sellon, respectfully. He rose as Harriet led Miss <==
Twitterton in, and brought forward another chair.

"Oh, please!" exclaimed Miss Twitterton, faintly. "Please don't leave
me, Lady Peter."

Twitterton in, and brought forward another chair.

"Oh, please!" exclaimed Miss Twitterton, faintly. "Please don't leave
me, Lady Peter."

==> "No, no," said Harriet. Mr. Kirk hastened to reassure the witness. <==

"Sit down, Miss Twitterton; there's nothing to be alarmed about. Now,
first of all, I understand you know nothing about your uncle's
arrangement with Lord Peter Wimsey--selling the house, I mean, and so
on. No. Just so. Now, when had you seen him last?"

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 129056    window = 129051 129061



"Exactly. Now, you're sure you've never left these keys about where they
might be pinched or borrowed?"

"No, never," replied Miss Twitterton, earnestly--as though, thought
==> Harriet, she asked nothing better than to twist a rope for her own neck. <==
Surely she must see that the key to the house was the key to the
problem; was it possible for any innocent person to be quite as innocent
as that? The Superintendent ploughed on with his questions unmoved.

"Where do you keep them at night?"

[line number in individual story] matching line = 5500    window = 5495 5505

my bed, with the dinner-bell handy in case of fire. And I'm _sure_
nobody could come in when I was asleep, because I always put a
deck-chair across the head of the staircase."

"You brought the dinner-bell down when you came to let us in," said
==> Harriet, vaguely corroborative. Her attention was distracted by the <==
sight of Peter's face, peering in through the diamond panes of the
lattice. She waved him a friendly gesture. Presumably he had walked off
his attack of self-consciousness and was getting interested again.

"A deck-chair?" Kirk was asking.

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 129083    window = 129078 129088


"To trip up a burglar," explained Miss Twitterton, very seriously. "It's
a _splendid_ thing. You see, while he was getting all tangled up and
making a noise, I should hear him and ring the dinner-bell out of the
window for the police."

==> "Dear me!" said Harriet. (Peter's face had vanished--perhaps he was <==
coming in.) "How dreadfully ruthless of you, Miss Twitterton. The poor
man might have fallen over it and broken his neck."

"What man?"

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 129102    window = 129097 129107



"Oh, dear, oh dear!" broke in Miss Twitterton, with unfeigned emotion.
"I knew _nothing_ about those. It's terrible. It gave me _such_ a shock.
I thought--we _all_ thought--Uncle was ever so well off."

==> Peter had come in so quietly that only Harriet noticed him. He remained <==
near the door, winding his watch and setting it by the clock on the
wall. Obviously he had come back to normal, for his face expressed only
an alert intelligence.

"Did he make a will, do you know?" Kirk dropped the question out

[line number in individual story] matching line = 5557    window = 5552 5562

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 129128    window = 129123 129133


"I'm afraid it doesn't look like it."

"Oh, dear! Was that what he meant when he said it was tied up in the
business? That there wasn't any?"

==> "That's what it very often does mean," said Harriet. <==

"Then that's what----" began Miss Twitterton, and stopped.

"That's what, what?" prompted the Superintendent.

explain----?"

"What?" demanded Kirk again.

"Nothing," repeated Miss Twitterton, hastily. "Only it sounds so silly
==> of me." Harriet received the impression that this was not what Miss <==
Twitterton had originally meant to say. "He borrowed a little sum of me
once--not much--but of course I hadn't _got_ much. Oh, dear! I'm afraid
it looks dreadful to be thinking about money just now, but...I _did_
think I'd have a little for my old age...and times are so hard...and
...and...there's the rent of my cottage...and..."

...and...there's the rent of my cottage...and..."

==> She quavered on the verge of tears. Harriet said confusedly: <==

"Don't worry. I'm sure something will turn up."

Kirk could not resist it. "Mr. Micawber!" he said, with a sort of
relief. A faint echo behind him drew his attention to Peter, and he

came popping out in a small shower.

"I'd counted on it--rather specially," sobbed Miss Twitterton. "Oh, I'm
sorry. Please don't pay any attention."

==> Kirk cleared his throat. Harriet, who was as a rule good at <==
handkerchiefs, discovered to her annoyance that on this particular
morning she had provided herself only with an elegant square of linen,
suitable for receiving such rare and joyful drops as might be expected
on one's honeymoon. Peter came to the rescue with what might have been a
young flag of truce.

on one's honeymoon. Peter came to the rescue with what might have been a
young flag of truce.

"It's quite clean," he said, cheerfully. "I always carry a spare."

==> (The devil you do, said Harriet to herself; you are too well trained by <==
half.)

Miss Twitterton buried her face in the silk and snuffled in a dismal
manner, while Joe Sellon studiously consulted the back pages of his
shorthand notes. The situation threatened to prolong itself.

at length. "Because I really think----"

"Er--well," said the Superintendent. "If Miss Twitterton wouldn't mind

Mr. Goodacre--he's always so kind--he's often said he knew it was
inconvenient having the practice on Wednesday, but it happens to suit
some of the men better, and so you see----"

"Six to kill and pluck," said Kirk, thoughtfully, as though estimating
==> the time that this would take. Harriet looked at the meek Miss <==
Twitterton in consternation.

"You don't mean to say you kill them yourself?"

"Oh, yes," said Miss Twitterton, brightly. "It's _so_ much easier than

"That's right." He tightened an imaginary noose about his own bull neck.
"Wring 'em or string 'em up--it's the sharp jerk does it."

His head flopped sideways suddenly, sickeningly. Miss Twitterton gave a
squeak of alarm; for the first time, perhaps, she realised where all
==> this had to end. Harriet was angry, and her face showed it. Men; when <==
they got together they were all alike--even Peter. For a moment he and
Kirk stood together on the far side of a chasm, and she hated them both.

"Steady on, Super," said Wimsey; "we're alarming the ladies."

"Dear, dear, that'll never do." Kirk was jovial; but the brown ox-eyes
were as watchful as the grey. "Well, thank you, Miss Twitterton. I think
that's all for the moment."

==> "That's all right then." Harriet got up. "It's all over. Come along and <==
see how Mr. Puffett is getting on with the kitchen chimney." She pulled
Miss Twitterton to her feet and steered her out of the room. As Peter
opened the door for them, she darted a reproachful glance at him, but,
as with Lancelot and Guinevere, their eyes met and hers fell.

In the meantime, Mr. Puffett, having cleared the kitchen chimney from
above and assisted at the lighting of the fire, had taken his fee and
gone home, uttering many expressions of sympathy and goodwill. Finally,
Miss Twitterton, tearful but flattered, was conveyed to Pagford by
Bunter in the car, with her bicycle perched "high and disposedly" upon
==> the back seat. Harriet saw her off and returned to the sitting-room, <==
where her lord and master was gloomily building a house of cards with a
greasy old pack which he had unearthed from the what-not.

"Well!" said Harriet, in unnaturally cheerful tones, "they've gone. At
last we are alone!"

"Not any more.... And I can't stand it now."

The words were not said rudely; he sounded merely helpless and
exhausted.

==> "I wasn't going to," said Harriet. <==

He made no reply, seeming absorbed in adding the fourth storey to his
structure. She watched him for a few moments, then decided he was best
left alone and wandered upstairs to fetch pen and paper. She thought it
might be a good thing to write a few lines to the Dowager Duchess.

down. The card house had reached the sixth storey. At the sound of her
step, Peter started, his hand shook, and the whole flimsy fabric
dissolved into ruins. He muttered something and began doggedly to
rebuild it.

==> Harriet glanced at the clock; it was nearly five, and she felt she could <==
do with some tea. She had coerced Mrs. Ruddle into putting the kettle on
and doing some work; it could not take very long now. She sat down on
the settle and began her letter. The news was not exactly what the
Duchess would expect to receive, but it was urgently necessary to write
something that she might get before the headlines broke out in the

her--things she would have told her in any case. She finished the first
page and looked up. Peter was frowning; the house, risen once again to
the fourth storey, was showing signs of imminent collapse. Without
meaning to, she began to laugh.

"What's the joke?" said Peter. The tottering cards immediately slid
apart, and he damned them fretfully. Then his face suddenly relaxed, and
the familiar, sidelong smile lifted the corner of his mouth.

==> "I was seeing the funny side of it," said Harriet, apologetically. "This <==
looks not like a nuptial."

"True, O God!" said he, ruefully. He got up and came over to her. "I
rather think," he observed in a detached and dubious manner, "I am
behaving like a lout."

"Surely you could get a friend to see to Bert's dinner," suggested

"Well," said Mrs. Ruddle, dubiously, "maybe Mrs. 'Odges would oblige.
But I'm thinkin' she'll want to come and 'ear wot's going on at the

of them had been ten years younger, the situation would have resolved
itself in a row, tears and reconciling embraces; but for them, that path
was plainly marked, NO EXIT. There was no help for it; he must get out

upon him for a good five years, she was in no position to feel

"Crushed again." His eyes danced, and all of a sudden her heart seemed
to turn right over. "O ye gods! render me worthy of this noble wife. All

"Well----"

"Heaven forbid! Arbitrary and tyrannical to the last degree. But I have
my softer moments--and my share of human folly."

the door behind her.

"Folly seems to be its own reward," said he. "Very well. Let us be
foolish together."

But he's attacking the strong side instead of the weak side of the case
against him."

"What do you think about Sellon yourself, Peter?"

==> They had breakfasted upstairs. Harriet was dressed, smoking a cigarette <==
in the window. Peter, in the half-way dressing-gown stage, was warming
the back of his legs at the fire. The ginger cat had arrived to pay its
morning compliment, and had taken up a position on his shoulder.

"I don't know what to think. The fact is, we've got dashed little

get Noakes's keys from his pocket, open the front door, put back the
keys and--well, then he'd have to go out leaving the door unlocked. And
when Noakes came to, he obligingly locked it behind him. We've got to
allow for that possibility, whoever did the murder."

==> "That's really brilliant, Harriet. It's very difficult to find a flaw in <==
it. And I'll tell you another thing. Sellon was the only person who
could, with comparative safety, leave the door unlocked. In fact, it
would be an advantage."

"You've got ahead of me there. Why?"

quarrelling. It's not awfully like Mrs. Ruddle to have gone away without
hearing the end of the row, when you come to think of it. If you look at
the thing in a prejudiced way, all her actions seem odd. And she had it
in for Sellon, and sprang it on him beautifully."

==> "Yes," said Harriet, thoughtfully. "And, you know, she kept on sort of <==
hinting things to me when we were doing the sandwiches for lunch. And
she was very artful about refusing to answer Sellon's questions before
the Superintendent came. But, honestly, Peter, do you think she and Bert
have brains enough between them to work out that business with the keys?
And would they have had the sense and self-restraint to keep their hands

Stair and through your bedroom when Miss Twitterton was being questioned
down here. Didn't you hear him? You brought Miss Twitterton down, and up
he nipped, pronto."

"Now let's hear the case against Crutchley and the vicar."

"Well--they're a bit more difficult, because of the alibi. Unless one of
them was in league with Mrs. Ruddle, we've got to explain away the

"So he could. Shall I run down and see whether it's working now or not?"

"Ask Bunter. He'll know."

==> Harriet called down the stairs to Bunter, and returned to say: <==

"Working perfectly. Bunter tried it yesterday evening after we'd gone."

"Ah! Then that proves nothing, one way or the other. Noakes may have
tried to turn it on, failed to spot the trouble till the news-bulletin

"Why should the----? Sorry! I keep on asking why."

"There's an awful strain of inquisitiveness on both sides of the family.
==> You'd better reconsider those children, Harriet; they'll be intolerable <==
pests from the cradle."

"So they will. Frightful. All the same, I do think it looks neater to
have a comprehensible motive. Murder for the fun of it breaks all the
rules of detective fiction."

repressions so common among clergymen as depicted by our realistic
novelists. So, of course, does Noakes. The vicar, under cover of a
purity campaign, accuses Noakes of corrupting the village maiden whom
subconsciously he wants for himself."

==> "Of course!" said Harriet, cheerfully. "How silly of me not to think of <==
it. Nothing could be more obvious. They have one of those squalid senile
rows--and the vicar ends up with a brain-storm and imagines he's the
hammer of God, like the parson in Chesterton's story. He lays Noakes out
with the poker and departs. Noakes recovers his senses--and we go on
from there. That accounts beautifully for the money's having been left

If he had been wanting to make her laugh, this time he succeeded beyond
hope or desire.

never shall we do anything like other people. We shall always laugh when
we ought to cry and love when we ought to work, and make ourselves a
scandal and a hissing. Don't do that! What ever will Bunter say if he

"Ah! Why, now?"

"As baffled as a bathroom geyser," agreed her husband. "My wife's
baffled too. It's the only point on which we are at one. When we're
tired of heaving crockery about we sit and sneer at one another's
bafflement. The police are baffled too. Or else they confidently expect

sake use a little tact."

Salcombe Hardy, his violet eyes luminous with sincerity, promised that

Peter badly mauled, and that, of the two, Peter had come off the worse.
He had picked his words carefully, and his light tone rang brittle as
glass. There was going to be more of this--much more. With sudden
determination she followed the pressmen out of the room and shut the
door.

to do all he could to keep the human story dignified.

Wimsey still leaning over the gate. Since he could scarcely force his

chose to give it to him. Half way through, he felt something blow warmly
upon his neck, and turned round with a start.

Mr. Puncheon, who was town-bred, turned pale. The bull was accompanied
by six cows, all inquisitive. Had he known it, their presence was the
best guarantee of the bull's good conduct; but to him they were all,
equally, large beasts with horns. He could not with courtesy drive them

away, because Lady Peter was thoughtfully scratching the bull's forehead
while contributing some interesting and exclusive details about her own
early life at Great Pagford. Manfully--for a reporter must accept all
risks in the execution of his duty--he stuck to his post, listening with
(he could not help it) a divided attention. "You are fond of animals?"

it's a sympathetic trait, isn't it?" "Sure thing," replied Hector
Puncheon. All very well; but the bull was on his side of the gate and
she was on the other. A friendly cow all red and white licked his

climbed over and escorted him with a firm hand to his car. The interview
was over, and he had had very little opportunity of getting a personal

his moving wheels.

By a remarkable coincidence, no sooner had he gone than the invisible

verge, I understand. A very satisfactory arrangement, if I may say so."

==> Harriet opened her mouth, and shut it again as a thought struck her. She <==
went down the passage and opened the back door. She was not really
surprised to see an extraordinarily ugly bull-mastiff tied by a rope to
the scraper. Bunter came out of the kitchen and padded softly into the
scullery.

"The owner brought him this morning, my lady, to inquire whether his
lordship might desire to purchase an animal of that description. I
understand he is an excellent watch-dog. I suggested that he should be
left here to await his lordship's convenience."

==> Harriet looked at Bunter, who returned her gaze unmoved. <==

"Have you thought of aeroplanes, Bunter? We might put a swan on the
roof."

"I have not been able to hear of a swan, my lady. But there is a person

instructions were perfectly clear. The lost time will be deducted from
his remuneration. We must not be paltered with. His lordship is not
accustomed to it. Excuse me, my lady--the goat is just arriving, and I
fear there may be a little difficulty with the dog on the doorstep."

"That's so," said Kirk, slowly. He was not sure about the implications
of this. Nor, to tell the truth, was Wimsey.

==> "He might," Harriet suggested softly in her husband's ear, "have lied <==
about the time."

"So he might. The queer thing is that he didn't. Mrs. Ruddle's clock
said the same."

"Here!" said Kirk, exasperated; "look at that!"

Peter looked. Mrs. Ruddle, on the doorstep, was holding a kind of court
among the reporters.

==> "Goodness!" said Harriet. "Peter, can't you take them away? Who was the <==
chap who leapt into the gulf?"

"Rome prizes most her citizens----"

"But every Englishman loves a lord. That's the idea."

"It's important to me. 'Sides, didn't 'e tell me as 'e was goin' to pay
me on Wednesday? I reckon the coroner ought to a-been told about it."

Salcombe Hardy, having had his chance with Peter, had not abandoned his
==> hold on Mrs. Ruddle. Mischievously, Harriet determined to pry him loose. <==

"Mr. Hardy--if you want an inside story, you'd better get hold of the
gardener, Frank Crutchley. There he is, over there, talking to Miss
Twitterton. He wasn't called at the inquest, so the others may not
realise he's got anything to tell them."

Twitterton. He wasn't called at the inquest, so the others may not
realise he's got anything to tell them."

Sally bubbled over with gratitude.

==> "If you make it worth his while," said Harriet, with serpent malice, "he <==
_might_ keep it exclusive."

"Thanks very much," said Sally, "for the tip."

"That's part of our bargain," said Harriet, beaming upon him. Mr. Hardy

"If you make it worth his while," said Harriet, with serpent malice, "he

"Thanks very much," said Sally, "for the tip."

==> "That's part of our bargain," said Harriet, beaming upon him. Mr. Hardy <==
was rapidly coming to the conclusion that Peter had married a most
fascinating woman. He made a rapid dart at Crutchley and in a few
moments was seen to depart with him in the direction of the Four-Ale
bar. Mrs. Ruddle, suddenly deserted, gazed indignantly about her.

As they drove away, six cameras clicked.

"Well, to be sure!" said Mrs. Ruddle.

"I think we must. Our example has encouraged him to start a
sherry-fashion in these parts, and he has sent for a bottle on purpose."

"Where from?"

"From the best hotel in Pagford.... I accepted with pleasure for both of
us. Was that wrong?"

"Just how naughty and selfish may I be?... May I drive fast?... I mean,
really fast?"

==> Harriet repressed a shudder. She liked to drive, and even liked being <==
driven, but anything over seventy miles an hour made her feel hollow
inside. Still, married people cannot have everything their own way.

"Yes, really fast--if you feel like that."

The ordeal lasted only as far as Great Pagford. Happily they encountered
none of Superintendent Kirk's black sheep parked on bends, though, just
outside, they shot past Frank Crutchley driving a taxi and were rewarded
by his astonished and admiring stare. Passing the police-station at a
demure legal thirty, they turned out westward and took to the
==> side-roads. Harriet, who could not distinctly recollect having breathed <==
at all since they left Paggleham, filled her lungs and observed in
resolutely steady tones that it was a lovely day for a run.

"Isn't it? Do you approve of this road?"

He laughed.

home--an old village with a new church and a pond flanking a trim
central green, all clustered at the base of a little rise. On the side
opposite the church, a narrow and rather ill-made lane appeared to rise
towards the brow of the hill.

==> "Let's go up there," said Harriet, appealed to for instructions. "It <==
looks as though we should get a good view."

The car swung into the lane and wound its way up with lazy ease between
low hedges already touched with autumn. Below and to their left was
spread the pleasant English country, green and russet with well-wooded

"May I lose my last dollar," he said, "if that isn't one of our
chimney-pots!"

==> "I believe you're right," said Harriet, staring at the sun-dial, whose <==
column did indeed bear a remarkable resemblance to a "Tooder pot." She
followed Peter out of the car and through the gate. Seen close to, the
sun-dial revealed itself as a miscellany; the dial and gnomon were
ancient; the base was a mill-stone; the column, when sharply tapped,
sounded hollow.

"I'm positive it is ours. Something tells me so. Let us register our
claim to it by a trifling act of vandalism which the first rain will
blot out." He solemnly took out a pencil and inscribed upon the pot:
"Talboys, _Suam quisque homo rem meminit_. Peter Wimsey." He handed the
==> pencil to his wife, who added, "Harriet Wimsey," with the date below. <==

"First time of writing it?"

"Yes. It looks a little drunk, but that's because I had to squat down to
it."

"No matter--it's an occasion. Let's occupy this handsome seat and
contemplate the landscape. The car's well off the road if anybody wants
to get up the lane."

==> The seat was solid and comfortable. Harriet pulled off her hat and sat <==
down, pleased to feel the soft wind stir her hair. Her gaze wandered
idly over the sunlit valley. Peter hung his hat on the extended hand of
a stout eighteenth-century cherub engaged in perusing a lichenous book
on an adjacent tombstone, sat down on the other end of the seat and
stared reflectively at his companion.

point where always, until now, he had been most triumphantly sure of
himself. His wife's serene face told him that she had somehow gained all
the confidence he had lost. Before their marriage, he had never seen her
look like that.

you find it good on the whole? Worth living?"

(He could, at any rate, trust her not to protest, archly: "That's a nice
thing to ask on one's honeymoon!")

Things have come straight. I always knew they would if one hung on long

"Well, it _seems_ like a miracle to be able to look forward--to--to see
all the minutes in front of one come hopping along with something
marvellous in them, instead of just saying, Well, that one didn't
actually hurt and the next may be quite bearable if only something

couldn't do anything so unutterably and divinely right by accident.
_Quelle folie--mais quel geste!_"

"I thought it would amuse you. That's why I told you instead of
borrowing a stamp from Bunter and writing a formal inquiry to the bank."

this speechless trance, and might not, in the manner of Donne's ecstatic
couple, have remained like sepulchral statues in the same posture and
saying nothing until nightfall, is uncertain. Three-quarters of an hour
later an elderly bearded person came creaking up the lane with a horse
and waggon. He looked at them with ruminative eyes, showing no
==> particular curiosity; but the spell was broken. Harriet swung herself <==
hurriedly off her husband's knees and stood up; Peter, who in London
would rather have been seen dead than embracing anybody in public,
astonishingly showed no embarrassment, but cried out a cordial greeting
to the carter.

(whom she vaguely remembered to have seen in the old days at bazaars and
flower shows, perpetually stout, amiable and a little red in the face)
had done honour to the occasion with a black lace dress and a daring

"So they are! How clever of you to know. I shall look to you to guide me

remember. I had a small offering of a _Teesdalia nudicaulis_ for his
rock-garden--he was fond of rock-plants. I felt very melancholy when I
planted it here, myself, this morning."

==> "You are even fonder of plants than he was," said Harriet, glancing <==
round the shabby room, which was filled with pot-plants on stands and
tables.

"I am afraid I must admit the soft impeachment. Gardening is an
indulgence of mine. My wife tells me it runs away with too much money,

"I have nothing more to say, Mrs. Ruddle. Good night to you."

The back door shut sharply and there was the noise of the drawing of
bolts. One could not now escape unheard. In another moment, feet began
==> to ascend the stair. Miss Twitterton withdrew hastily into Harriet's <==
bedroom. The feet came on; they passed the branching of the stair; they
were coming in. Miss Twitterton retired still further, shocked to find
herself trapped in a gentleman's bedroom that smelt faintly of bay rum
and Harris tweed. Next door she heard the crackle of a kindled fire, the
rattle of curtain rings upon the rods, a subdued clink, the pouring of

The little scene broke like a bubble. The chief actor leapt to his feet
and said very distinctly:

"Damn and blast!"

==> Harriet got up. The sudden shattering of her ecstatic mood and a swift, <==
defensive anger for Peter's sake made her tone sharper than she knew:

"Who is it? What are you doing there?" She stepped out of the pool of
light and peered into the dusk. "_Miss Twitterton?_"

went on choking hysterically. A voice from the direction of the
fireplace said grimly:

"I knew I should make a bloody fool of myself."

==> "Something's happened," said Harriet, more gently, putting out a <==
reassuring hand. Miss Twitterton found her voice:

"Oh, forgive me--I didn't know--I never meant----" The remembrance of
her own misery got the upper hand of her alarm. "Oh, I'm so dreadfully
unhappy."

the ominous words had penetrated to Miss Twitterton's consciousness. A
new terror checked her tears in mid-flow.

"Oh, dear, oh, dear! The port wine! Now he'll be angry again."

==> "Good heavens!" exclaimed Harriet, completely bewildered. "What has gone <==
wrong? What is it all about?"

Miss Twitterton shuddered. A cry of "Bunter!" in the passage warned her
that the crisis was imminent.

voice now, subdued to a long, explanatory mumble. "Oh, dear, oh, dear,

think so."

But alarm is infectious...and much-tried men have been known to vent
their exasperation upon their servants. The two women clung together,
waiting for the explosion.

The sounds died away, and the women breathed more freely. The dreadful
menace of male violence lifted its shadow from the house.

Twitterton, what _is_ the matter? You're trembling all over.... Surely,
_surely_ you didn't really think Peter was going to--to throw things
about or anything, did you? Come and sit down by the fire. Your hands

things to me. Oh, please forgive me!"

fit to clean your shoes."

shut the door upon this heartless exhibition. Miss Twitterton, exhausted
by her own emotions, sat weeping quietly in a corner of the settle.
Harriet was conscious of a whole series of emotions, arranged in layers
like a Neapolitan ice.

terribly angry. You see, I heard you coming in--just outside the
door--and I simply couldn't face anybody--so I ran upstairs--and then I
didn't hear anything so I thought you'd gone and came down--and seeing
you so happy together..."

==> "It doesn't matter the very least bit," said Harriet, hastily. "_Please_ <==
don't think any more about it. He knows it was quite an accident.
Now--don't cry any more."

"I must be going." Miss Twitterton made vague efforts to straighten her
disordered hair and the jaunty little hat. "I'm afraid I look a sight."

"I've never had powder on before. It--it makes me feel quite fast."

She stared, fascinated.

==> "Well," said Harriet, cheerfully, "it's helpful sometimes. Let me tuck <==
up this little curl behind----"

Her own dark, glowing face came into the mirror behind Miss Twitterton's
and she saw with a shock that the trail of vine-leaves was still in her
hair. "Goodness! how absurd I look! We were playing silly games----"

"Good night." The opening of the door revealed Bunter, hovering with a
tray in the background.

"I _hope_ I haven't kept you from your supper."

don't worry. Bunter, please show Miss Twitterton out."

She stood absently, gazing at her own face in the mirror, the
vine-wreath trailing from her hand.

Peter came in cautiously, carrying a decanter.

He put down the wine at a carefully calculated distance from the fire
and observed, in a conversational tone:

"We found some decanters, after all."

"It would be. Yes, I see. You could put it forward, but you couldn't put
it right again. And you couldn't put it back at all. Not more than ten
minutes or so. Ten minutes might be valuable. Sellon said it was five
past nine. Then, by all the rules, he should need an alibi for----

moment of the murder unless you take pains to _fix_ the moment of the
murder. If a ten-minute alibi is to work, the time must be fixed within
ten minutes. And it's only fixed within twenty-five--and even then, we
can't be _sure_ about the wireless. Can't _you_ do something with the
wireless? That's the mystery-monger's white-headed boy."

and, by the way, was it you playing hide-and-seek with Miss Twitterton

"My lord?"

==> "All right, Bunter," said Harriet, quickly. <==

Bunter took the hint and vanished murmuring, "Very good."

"She was hiding from us, Peter, because she'd been crying when we came
in and she didn't want to be caught."

gone, too. And now he finds she won't come into any money from her
uncle.... What are you looking at me like that for?"

==> "Harriet, I don't like this at all." He was gazing at her with an <==
expression of growing consternation.

"Of course, he's chucked her over now--the brute!"

a little to the side of the pen.... Now...two quick steps and a brisk
rap on the skull--you needn't hit too hard--and you're an exceedingly

"Niece--widow's a hateful word; so weedy--let's stick to niece."

"I slump down, and the chair slips away, so that I bruise my right side

extend her hen-runs. Serve me right for being weak-minded. The moral is,
Stick to How, and somebody will hand you the Why on a silver salver."

He read remonstrance in her eyes, and added earnestly:

==> "It's a whacking great motive, Harriet. A middle-aged woman's last bid <==
for love--and the money to make the bid."

"It was Crutchley's motive, too. Couldn't she have let him in? Or lent
him the key, not knowing what he wanted it for?"

"Crutchley's times are all wrong. Though he may have been an accomplice.
If so, he's got damned good reason for giving her the chuck now. In

"It's all very well, Peter, but where's your proof?"

"Nowhere."

For the first time he seemed to realise what she was saying. "Oh!" he
said, softly, and turned away towards the fire. "I was afraid it might
come to this." Then, over his shoulder:

==> "One can't suppress evidence, Harriet. You said to me, 'Carry on.'" <==

"We didn't _know_ these people then. She told me in confidence. She--she
was grateful to me. She trusted me. You can't take people's trust and

in a sort of consternation. Her excitement broke against his rigidity
like water against a stone. "It's--it's brutal."

"Murder is brutal."

Of course she had known it, but---- She burst out with the truth:

married now. We are bound. I'm afraid the moment has come when something
will have to give way--you, or I--or the bond."

(So soon?... Yours, utterly and for ever--he was hers, or else all faith
was mockery.)

she had done.

"Peter, you're mad. Never dare to suggest such a thing. Whatever
marriage is, it isn't that."

==> "Isn't what, Harriet?" <==

"Letting your affection corrupt your judgment. What kind of life could
we have if I knew that you had become less than yourself by marrying
me?"

"I know, I've heard them." Her own scorn lashed herself--the self she
had only just seen. "They boast of it--'My husband would do _anything_
for me....' It's degrading. No human being ought to have such power over
another."

==> "It's a very real power, Harriet." <==

"Then," she flung back passionately, "we won't use it. If we disagree,
we'll fight it out like gentlemen. We won't stand for matrimonial
blackmail."

He was silent for a moment, leaning back against the chimney-breast.
Then he said, with a lightness that betrayed him:

==> "Harriet; you have no sense of dramatic values. Do you mean to say we <==
are to play out our domestic comedy without the great bedroom scene?"

"Certainly. We'll have nothing so vulgar."

"Well--thank God for that!"

think right. Promise me that. What I think doesn't matter. I swear it
shall never make any difference."

He took her hand and kissed it gravely.

==> "Thank you, Harriet. That is love with honour." <==

They stood so for a moment; both conscious that something had been
achieved that was of enormous--of overmastering importance. Then Harriet
said, practically:

job, and it's worth doing."

He laughed--and Bunter came in with the soup.

"I regret that dinner is a little late, my lady."

==> Harriet looked at the clock. It seemed to her that she had lived through <==
interminable ages of emotion. But the hands stood at a quarter past
eight. Only an hour and a half had gone by since they had entered the
house.

_there_. And that will give us a direct outfall for the bath to the
sewer--if I may dignify it by that name. I think there'd be room to make
another little bedroom near the bathroom; and when we want more space,
we can convert the attics. The electric plant can live in the stable."

==> Harriet agreed and offered her own contribution: <==

"Bunter speaks none too kindly of the kitchen range. He says he would
designate it as a period piece, my lady, but, if I will permit him to
say so, of an inferior period. I think it's mid-Victorian."

and I have run----"

hands. Bunter hurried out.

choking his speech--"and I have run all the way from the buth-thtop--all

Mr. MacBride, spoke feelingly yesterday morning about our English family

up the happy home! Over a slice of the breast and a glass of the best

==> "Yes, indeed," said Harriet. "Do join us. Bunter will break his heart if <==

Mr. MacBride hesitated.

"It's very good of you," began Mr. Solomons, wistfully. "If your

that it is a husband's incurable habit to invite his business friends to
dine under any circumstances and on the shortest possible notice.
Without that habit, home life would not be what it is. Therefore I make
no apology."

==> "Of course not," said Harriet. "Bunter, these gentlemen will dine with <==
us."

"Very good, my lady." He laid dexterous hands on Mr. Solomons and
relieved him of his overcoat. "Allow me." Mr. MacBride, without further
argument, valeted himself and then helped Peter to bring two more chairs

"Me," said his lordship. He detached the straws methodically, one by
one, and began to thread them through his hair. He had succeeded in
making a very passable bird's-nest of himself when Superintendent Kirk
was announced.

==> "Good evening, Mr. Kirk," said Harriet, with as much warmth of welcome <==
as she could put into the words.

"Good evening," said the Superintendent. "I'm afraid I'm intruding." He
looked at Peter, who made a horrible face at him. "It's a bit late for a
call."

of beer or some whisky or something and don't mind my husband. He
sometimes gets taken that way."

The Superintendent thanked her absent-mindedly; he seemed to be in
travail with an idea. He slowly opened his mouth, and looked at Peter

furniture, and your old friend Mr. MacBride, who wants to distrain on
the furniture for his writ, and they both came in together to take the

Peter finished his crown and put it on.

"It's an odd thing," he observed, "that men like Crutchley, with
quantities of large white teeth, are practically always gay Lotharios."

==> "Not frivolously gay, either," said Harriet. "Two strings to the bow for <==
use and one for pleasure."

"Frank Crutchley," said Kirk, "has got too much o' what the cat cleans
'er paws with. Stupid cop, indeed--I'll cop 'im, the cheeky 'ound, one
o' these days."

a proper way, there's no need to have keys to other folks' barns.' I
didn't say anything about the young lady in London, because that's over
and done with, but where there's one there might be two."

==> "There were two," said Harriet, resolutely; "and the other one was here, <==
in Pagford."

"What's that?" said Kirk.

Harriet told her story for the second time that evening.

"There were two," said Harriet, resolutely; "and the other one was here,

"What's that?" said Kirk.

==> Harriet told her story for the second time that evening. <==

"Well, I'm bothered!" exclaimed Mr. Kirk, laughing heartily. "Poor old
Aggie Twitterton! Kissing Frank Crutchley in the churchyard. That's a
good 'un!"

"Not at all," said Peter. "Parting is such sweet sorrow--we've had quite

                 *        *        *        *        *

Superintendent to the door, "he wasn't unreasonable, after all. But oh!
I do hope there won't be any more people to-night."

"_Nous menons une vie assez mouvementée._ I've never known such a day.

with Mr. MacBride and Mr. Solomons. With your lordship's permission, I
will suggest that I should take the car over to Broxford and order a few
temporary necessities--such as a couple of camp-beds and a kettle."

==> "Peter," said Harriet, looking up from her correspondence, "there's a <==
letter from your mother. She says she is going down to the Dower House
this morning. The shooting-party at the Hall has broken up, and Gerald
and Helen are going for the week-end to Lord Attenbury's. She wonders
whether we should like to join her for a day or two. She thinks we may
need rest and change--not from one another, she is careful to explain,

"You really feel that?"

one gets what one fancied one wanted.

"You'll never want to come back to this house again."

downstairs and found Superintendent Kirk about to take his leave, and
Mr. MacBride just issuing victor from a heated three-cornered argument
between himself, Mr. Solomons and a dusty-looking professional person
who explained that he represented the executrix. What precise business
arrangement had been come to, Peter did not ask and never discovered.
==> The upshot seemed to be that the furniture was to go, Harriet (on <==
Peter's behalf) having waived all claim to it on the grounds (_a_) that
they had so far paid nothing for the use of it, (_b_) that they would
not have it if it were given away with a pound of tea and (_c_) that
they were going away for the week-end and (_d_) would be glad to have it
out of the house as soon as possible to make room for their own goods.

==> Mr. MacBride's men worked expertly. Harriet, watching the swift <==
disintegration of her honeymoon house into a dusty desert of straw and
packing-cases, rolled-up curtains and spidery pictures spreading their
loose wires like springes, wondered whether the whole of her married
life would have the same kaleidoscopic quality. Character is destiny:
probably there was something in her and Peter that doomed them never to

get through, and it didn't seem somehow quite the right thing just to
sit down quietly and read a book. There's something to be said, after
all, for the sight-seeing kind of honeymoon--it does give one a
programme."

==> Well; things did not always go according to programme. Harriet looked up <==
from the fire-irons and with some surprise observed Frank Crutchley.

"Were you wanting any help, my lady?"

"Well, Crutchley, I don't know. Are you free this morning?"

"I've had words with Mrs. Goodacre--leastways, she 'ad words with me.
That Kirk...interfering. It ain't no business of Vicar's wife about me
and Polly Mason. I went up about 'aving the banns published, and Mrs.
Goodacre set on me."

==> "Oh!" said Harriet. She was not very well pleased with Crutchley <==
herself; but since he obviously had no idea that Miss Twitterton had
made her troubles public, it seemed better not to refer to the subject.
By this time, Miss Twitterton was probably regretting that she had
spoken. And to take the matter up with Crutchley would only emphasise
the poor little woman's humiliation by giving it importance. Besides,

"And there's a sight o' things in the outhouse," said George. "Jack's
out there; he'd be glad of a hand with them."

Crutchley put the steps back against the wall and went out. George and
==> Bill departed upstairs. Harriet remembered that Peter's tobacco and <==
cigars were in the what-not and collected them. Then, smitten by a
sudden pang, she hastened out into the pantry. It was already stripped.
With the Furies at her heels, she bounded down the cellar steps, not
even pausing to remember what had once lain at the foot of them. The
place was dark as Egypt, but she struck a match, and breathed again. All

"I went to see if the wine was all right. I see Bunter has put up a
notice. But please tell the men specially that they mustn't on any
account lay a finger on those bottles."

==> Crutchley broke into a wide smile that showed Harriet how attractive his <==
face could be and threw light on the indiscretions of Miss Twitterton
and Polly Mason.

"They ain't likely to forget, my lady. Mr. Bunter, he spoke to them
himself--very solemn. He sets great store by that wine, seemin'ly. If

"They ain't likely to forget, my lady. Mr. Bunter, he spoke to them
himself--very solemn. He sets great store by that wine, seemin'ly. If
you could a-heard him yesterday ticking off Martha Ruddle----"

==> Harriet wished she had heard it, and was greatly tempted to ask for an <==
eye-witness account of the scene; but considered that Crutchley's
forwardness of manner scarcely called for encouragement; besides,
whether he knew it or not, he was in her bad books. She said,
repressively:

"Oh, yes--that doesn't belong to us. Only the bottled beer."

"Very good, my lady."

Crutchley went out again, without taking whatever it was he had come
==> for, and Harriet returned to the sitting-room. With a kind of tolerant <==
pity, she lifted the aspidistras from their containing pots and gathered
them into a melancholy little group on the floor, together with a
repellent little cactus like an over-stuffed pincushion and a young
rubber-plant. She had seldom seen plants she could care less for, but
they were faintly hallowed by sentimental association: Peter had laughed

rubber-plant. She had seldom seen plants she could care less for, but
they were faintly hallowed by sentimental association: Peter had laughed
at them. She reflected she must be completely besotted about Peter, if
his laughter could hallow an aspidistra.

==> "Very well," said Harriet aloud to herself, "I will _be_ besotted." She <==
selected the largest aspidistra and kissed one of its impassive shining
surfaces. "But," she added cheerfully to the cactus, "I won't kiss _you_
till you've shaved." A head came suddenly through the window and
startled her.

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 136060    window = 136055 136065


startled her.

"Excuse me, lady," said the head. "Is that there perambulator in the
outhouse yourn?"

==> "What? Oh, dear no," said Harriet, with a vivid and sympathetic <==
appreciation of Peter's feelings the evening before. (_I knew I should
make a bloody fool of myself_--they both seemed to be fated that way.)
"It must be something the late owner picked up in a sale."

"Right you are, lady," said the head--Jack's, presumably--and

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 136073    window = 136068 136078


Her own clothes were packed. Bunter had come up shortly after
breakfast--while Peter was writing letters--and had discovered her
struggling with the orange frock. After watching her thoughtfully for a
few moments he had offered his assistance, and it had been accepted with
relief. The more intimate parts of the business had, after all, been
==> effected previously--though, when Harriet saw her underwear unpacked <==
later on, she could not remember having used so much tissue paper and
was surprised to know herself such a neat packer.

Anyhow; it was all done.

It was quite a large party that entered--if they had all come in the
Daimler they must have looked like an undertakers' bean-feast; but no!
the vicar was there, and he might have brought some of them in his own
little car. He came in, wearing his cassock, with his surplice and
Oxford hood over one arm while with the other he gave fatherly support
==> to Miss Twitterton. She, Harriet saw at a glance, was in a much more <==
resilient mood than she had been the evening before. Though her eyes
were red with funerary tears, and she clutched a handkerchief with a
sable border in her black-kid-gloved hand, the excitement of being chief
mourner behind so important a hearse had evidently restored all her lost
self-importance. Mrs. Ruddle followed. Her mantle, of strange and

pile of prayer-books and a severe-looking bowler, might, by contrast,
have been the deceased's nearest and dearest relative, so determined was
his countenance in an appropriate gloom. After Bunter came, rather
unexpectedly, Mr. Puffett, in a curious greenish-black cutaway coat of
incredible age, buttoned perilously across his sweaters over his working
==> trousers. Harriet felt sure he must have been married in that coat. His <==
bowler was not the bowler of Wednesday morning, but of the mashing
curly-brimmed pattern affected by young bloods of the 'nineties.

"Well!" said Harriet, "here you all are!"


[line number in individual story] matching line = 12587    window = 12582 12592

trousers. Harriet felt sure he must have been married in that coat. His
bowler was not the bowler of Wednesday morning, but of the mashing
curly-brimmed pattern affected by young bloods of the 'nineties.

==> "Well!" said Harriet, "here you all are!" <==

She hastened forward to greet Miss Twitterton, but was arrested mid-way
by the entrance of her husband, who had stopped to put a rug over the
radiator. He came in now with a touch of bravura, probably induced by
self-consciousness. The effect of his sombre suit and scarf, rigidly

marred by the irresponsible tilt of his top-hat.

"Hullo-ullo-ullo," said his lordship, genially. He grounded the
umbrella, smiled diffidently, and removed the topper with a flourish.

==> "Do come and sit down," said Harriet, recovering herself, and leading <==
Miss Twitterton to a chair. She took the black-kid hand and squeezed it
comfortingly.

"Jerusalem, my happy home!" His lordship surveyed his domain and
apostrophised it with some emotion. "Is this the city that men call the

apostrophised it with some emotion. "Is this the city that men call the
perfection of beauty? Woe to the spoiler--the chariots of Israel and the
horsemen thereof!"

He appeared to be in that rather unreliable mood which is apt to follow
==> upon attendance at funerals and other solemn functions. Harriet said <==
severely, "Peter, behave yourself," and turned quickly to ask Mr.
Goodacre:

"Were there many people at the funeral?"

"It's _most_ gratifying," cried Miss Twitterton, "--all this respect for
Uncle." A pink flush spread over her cheeks--she looked almost pretty.
"Such a _mass_ of flowers! Sixteen wreaths--including your _beautiful_
tribute, dear Lady Peter."

==> "Sixteen!" said Harriet. "Just fancy!" She felt as though she had <==
received a sharp jolt over the solar plexus.

"And fully choral!" continued Miss Twitterton! "Such _touching_ hymns.
And _dear_ Mr. Goodacre----"

"Ow," agreed Mrs. Ruddle, "it was all just beautiful. I never seen a
funeral to touch it, and I been to every buryin' in Paggleham these
forty year and more."

==> She appealed to Mr. Puffett for confirmation, and Harriet seized the <==
opportunity to question Peter:

"Peter--_did_ we send a wreath?"

"God knows. Bunter--_did_ we send a wreath?"

"And Fleet Street in full force," said Peter. "Bunter, I see glasses on
the radio cabinet. We could do with some drinks."

"Very good, my lord."

==> "I'm afraid they've commandeered the beer-barrel," said Harriet, with a <==
glance at Mr. Puffett.

"That's awkward," said Peter. He stripped off his overcoat, and with it
his last vestige of sobriety. "Well, Puffett, I dare say you can make do
for once with the bottled variety. First discovered, so they say, by

place, picked up his curly bowler and said heartily:

"That's very kind of your lordship. Come along, Martha. Get off your
bonnet and shawl and we'll give these lads a 'and outside."

about getting some lunch of some sort. Will you stay and have something

vanished. "I only said that because Mrs. Ruddle--though an excellent
servant in her way--sometimes needs a reminder. Mr. Goodacre, won't you
have a drop more sherry?"

"No, really--I must be moving homewards."

"Oh! dear me! Yes of course. Oh, dear--yes, please tell them I think I
had better come and see to that myself.... You see--dear me!--however
did I come to forget?--there are quite a lot of my things here." She

towards the door by which Miss Twitterton had gone out. She thought of
the trap-door in the attic--and the boxes. Had Kirk searched those
boxes, she wondered. If not--well, then, what? Could there be anything
in a box? A blunt instrument, with perhaps a little skin and hair on it?
It seemed to her that they had all been standing silent a very long

"From here," said Peter, stepping back, "it looks like a spot of mildew,
though I can't see very well from this distance. But perhaps in a cactus
that's merely the bloom of a healthy complexion."

==> "It _is_ mildew," said the vicar, grimly. Harriet, feeling that <==
intelligent sympathy was called for, climbed on the settle, so that she
could look at the plant on a level.

"There's some more of it on the upper side of the leaves--if they are
leaves, and not stalks."

leaves, and not stalks."

"Somebody," said Mr. Goodacre, "has been giving it too much water." He
looked accusingly from husband to wife.

==> "We haven't any of us touched it," said Harriet. She stopped, <==
remembering that Kirk and Bunter had handled it. But they were scarcely
likely to have watered it.

"I'm a humane man," began Peter, "and though I don't _like_ the prickly
brute----"

agonised dreamer of the morning hours.

"What is it, Peter?"

To be interrupted at a crisis had become so much a feature of daily life

Crutchley.

"If it will not inconvenience your lordship, the men are anxious to get

were not making too good a job of it, and it stuck. Peter, with sudden
impatience, pulled off his coat.

Whether by good luck or superior management, no sooner had Peter set his

have asked him----"

"Bunter," said Peter, "you heard what I said. If Mr. Goodacre likes, you
can brush him. I will _not_ be brushed. I refuse."

==> He spoke with more sharpness, under his light tone, than Harriet had <==
ever heard him use. She thought: "For the first time since we were
married he has forgotten my existence." She went over to the coat he had
thrown off and began to search it for cigarettes; but she did not miss
Bunter's quick upward glance or the almost imperceptible jerk of Peter's
head.

"Oh, yes." Mr. Goodacre took up his thread again. "I was about to say,
that is certainly a new chain. The old one was of brass to match the
pot, whereas this----"

==> "Peter!" said Harriet, involuntarily. <==

"Yes," he said, "I know now." He seized upon the ornamental drain-pipe,
tossed the pampas-grasses out of it and tilted it up, just as Crutchley
came in--this time with the man Bill--and advanced upon the other
settle.

Crutchley with him.

As the door shut, Peter lifted the drain-pipe. At the bottom of it lay a
brass chain, curled together like a sleeping serpent.

==> Harriet said: "The chain that came down the chimney." <==

Peter's glance swept over her as though she had been a stranger.

"A new chain was fixed up and the other one hidden up the chimney. Why?"
He lifted the chain and looked at the cactus as it hung centred over the

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 136626    window = 136621 136631


"Now that," he said, taking the end of the chain in his hand, "looks
remarkably like the original chain. See. It is darkened with soot, but
it's quite bright when you rub it."

Peter dropped his end of the chain, leaving it dangling in the vicar's
==> hand. He picked out Harriet from the rest and said to her, as though <==
propounding a problem to the brightest-looking of a not-too-hopeful
class:

"When Crutchley had watered the cactus, which he had watered the week
before and which should only be watered once a month----"

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 136639    window = 136634 136644



"--he was on the steps here. He wiped the pot. He got down. He put back
the steps over here by the clock. He came back here to the cabinet. Can
you remember what he did next?"

==> Harriet shut her eyes, once more seeing the room as it had been on that <==
strange morning.

"I believe----"

She opened them again. Peter laid his hands gently, one on each side of

[line number in individual story] matching line = 13106    window = 13101 13111

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 136677    window = 136672 136682


"Just about. Just about. I may have had the advantage of him by an inch,
but not more."

"If I'd had more inches," said Peter, regretfully (for his height was a
sensitive point with him), "I might have had more brains. Better late
==> than never." His eye roamed the room, passed over Harriet and the vicar <==
and rested on Bunter. "You see," he said, "we've got the first and last
terms of the progression--if we could fill in the middle terms."

"Yes, my lord," agreed Bunter, in a colourless voice. His heart had
leapt within him. Not the new wife this time, but the old familiar

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 136689    window = 136684 136694


"If I might make a suggestion, it would be as well to verify the
difference in the chains before we proceed."

"Quite right, Bunter. Clear as you go. Get the steps."

==> Harriet watched Bunter as he mounted and took the brass chain that the <==
vicar mechanically handed to him But it was Peter who heard the step on
the stair. Before Miss Twitterton was in the room he was half-way across
it, and when she turned from shutting the door after her, he stood at
her elbow.


[line number in individual story] matching line = 13144    window = 13139 13149

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 136715    window = 136710 136720


"Why, with pleasure!" cried Miss Twitterton, delighted that the task was
not beyond her powers. "I'll run up and look for it at once. I always
say I'm _remarkably_ good at finding things."

"It's extraordinarily kind of you," said Peter. He manœuvred her gently
==> to the door, opened it for her, and shut it after her. Harriet said <==
nothing. She knew where Peter's pen was, for she had seen it in the
inner breast pocket of his coat when she was looking for cigarettes, and
she felt a cold weight at the pit of her stomach. Bunter, who had
slipped quickly down from the steps, stood, chain in hand, as though
ready to put the gyves on a felon when he heard the word. Peter came

[line number in individual story] matching line = 13156    window = 13151 13161

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 136727    window = 136722 136732



"Four inches difference, my lord."

His master nodded.

==> "Bunter--no, I shall want you." He saw Harriet and spoke to her as <==
though she had been his footman. "Here, you, go and fasten the door at
the top of the back stair. Don't let her hear you if you can help it.
Here are the house-keys. Lock the doors, front and back. Make sure that
Ruddle and Puffett and Crutchley are all inside. If anyone says
anything, those are my orders. Then bring the keys back--do you

anything, those are my orders. Then bring the keys back--do you
understand?... Bunter, take the steps and see if you can find anything
in the way of a hook or a nail in the wall or ceiling on that side of
the chimney-place."

==> Harriet was out of the room, and tip-toeing along the passage. Voices in <==
the kitchen and a subdued clinking told her that lunch was being got
ready--and probably eaten. Through the open door she glimpsed the back
of Crutchley's head--he was tilting a mug to his lips. Beyond him stood
Mr. Puffett, his wide jaws moving slowly on a large mouthful. She could
not see Mrs. Ruddle, but in a moment her voice came through from the

of Crutchley's head--he was tilting a mug to his lips. Beyond him stood
Mr. Puffett, his wide jaws moving slowly on a large mouthful. She could
not see Mrs. Ruddle, but in a moment her voice came through from the
scullery. "... See it was that there Joe, plain as the nose on 'is face,
and goodness knows that's big enough, but there! 'e's too much taken up
==> with 'is good lady..." Somebody laughed. Harriet thought it was George. <==
She scurried past the kitchen, ran up the Privy Stair, locking the back
door as she went, and found herself, panting, more with excitement than
haste, at the door of her own room. The key was on the inside. She
turned the handle softly and crept in. Nothing was there but her own
boxes, packed and waiting, and the component parts of what had been the

haste, at the door of her own room. The key was on the inside. She
turned the handle softly and crept in. Nothing was there but her own
boxes, packed and waiting, and the component parts of what had been the
bed, stacked ready for removal. In the next room she could hear little
scuffling sounds, and then Miss Twitterton chirping agitatedly to
==> herself (like the White Rabbit, thought Harriet): "Oh, dear, oh, dear! <==
what has become of it?" (or was it, "what will become of me?"). For a
flash of time Harriet stood, her hand already on the key. If she were to
go in and say, "Miss Twitterton, _he knows_ who killed your uncle, and
..." Like the White Rabbit--a white rabbit in a cage....

Then she was out and locking the door behind her.

with a pocket-torch.

"A cup-hook, my lord, painted black and screwed into the beam."

"Ah!" Peter measured the distance with his eye, from the hook to the
==> cabinet and back again. Harriet held out the keys to him and he pocketed <==
them absent-mindedly without so much as a nod.

"Proof," he said. "Proof of something at last. But where is the----?"

The vicar, who seemed to have been putting two and two carefully

Puffett----"

"Fetch him here," said Peter.

Bunter was off the steps before he spoke. "Yes, my lord," he said, and
==> was gone like lightning. Harriet's eye fell on the chain, which lay, <==
where Bunter had left it, on top of the cabinet. She picked it up and
the clink of the links caught Peter's ear.

"Best get rid of that," he said. "Give it me." He scanned the room for a
hiding-place--then, with a sort of chuckle, made for the chimney.

[line number in individual story] matching line = 13233    window = 13228 13238

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 136804    window = 136799 136809



"We'll put it back where it came from," he said, as he dived under the
cowl. "Safe bind, safe find, as Puffett is fond of observing." He
emerged again, dusting his hands.

==> "There's a ledge, I suppose," said Harriet. <==

"Yes. The gun dislodged the chain. If Noakes had kept his chimneys
swept, his murderer might have been safe. What's that, padre, about
doing evil that good may come?"

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 136867    window = 136862 136872


He threaded one end of the line through one of the rings at the lip of
the pot, brought the two ends with their sinkers together and handed
them to Bunter, who took them without a word, mounted the steps and
passed the double line over the hook in the ceiling.

==> "Oh!" said Harriet. "I see now. Peter, how horrible!" <==

"Haul up," said Peter, unheeding. "Take care you don't foul the line."

Bunter hauled on the line, grunting a little as it cut into his fingers.
The pot, steadied from below by Peter's outstretched hand, stirred,

"I can feel it," said Peter, grimly. "How did you come not to notice its
weight when you and Kirk were examining it? It's been loaded with
something--lead shot from the feel of it. This must have been planned
some time ago."

==> "So that," said Harriet, "is how a woman could have broken a tall man's <==
head. A woman with strong hands."

"Or anybody," said Peter, "who didn't happen to be there at the time.
Anyone with a cast-iron alibi. God makes power, padre, and man makes
engines."

engines."

He brought the two ends of the line to the edge of the cabinet, to which
they reached exactly. He lifted the lid and slipped them under; then
brought the lid down upon them. The spring catch stood up to the strain,
==> and the sinkers held firm against the flange, though Harriet noticed <==
that the pull of the heavy pot had raised the near side of the cabinet
slightly from the ground. But it could not lift far; since its feet were
jammed close against the end of the settle, over which the thin black
line stretched taut and nearly invisible to the hook in the beam.

Kirk looked at the pot again.

"H'm," he said slowly. "Pretty--but I'd like a bit o' proof. There
weren't no blood nor 'air on that there pot w'en I last see it."

==> "Of course not!" cried Harriet. "It was wiped." <==

"When and how?" said Peter, slewing round on her sharply.

"Why, not till last Wednesday morning. The day before yesterday. You
reminded us only just now. On Wednesday morning, under our very eyes,

while we all sat round and watched. That's How, Peter, that's How!"

"Yes," he said, smiling at her excitement. "That's How. And now we know
How, we know Who."

==> "Thank God, we know something at last," said Harriet. At the moment she <==
cared little for How or Who. Her jubilee was for the alert cock of
Peter's head, as he stood and smiled at her, balancing himself lightly
and swaying a little on his toes. A job finished--and, after all, no
failure--no more frustrated dreams about chained and defeated men
seeking a lost memory among hot deserts horrid with prickly cactus.

marry the heiress--two birds with one blunt instrument, eh?"

"The heiress?" exclaimed the vicar, in fresh bewilderment. "But he's
marrying Polly Mason--he came round about the banns this morning."

==> "That's rather a sad story, Mr. Goodacre," said Harriet. "He was <==
secretly engaged to Miss Twitterton and he--hush!"

"D'you think they were in it together?" began Kirk--and then suddenly
woke up to the fact that Miss Twitterton was in the room with them.

"Which he did," said Mrs. Ruddle, "reg'lar as clockwork----"

"Why, then----"

==> But Harriet had thought of an objection, and whatever Peter thought of <==
her she must put it.

"But, Peter--could anybody--even by candlelight, walk right up to that
cabinet without noticing that the cactus wasn't there?"


[line number in individual story] matching line = 13514    window = 13509 13519

heavy pot threshed down like a flail. It flashed as it came. It skimmed
within an inch over Crutchley's head, striking white terror into his
face with its passing, and shattered the globe of the lamp into a
thousand tinkling fragments.

==> Then, and only then, Harriet realised that they had all cried out, and <==
she among them. And, after that, there was silence for several seconds,
while the great pendulum swung over them in a gleaming arc.

Peter spoke, warningly:


[line number in individual story] matching line = 13528    window = 13523 13533

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 137099    window = 137094 137104


the face of a beast.

"You devil! You damned cunning devil! How did you know? Curse you--how
did you know I done it? I'll have the throat out of you!"

==> He leapt, and Harriet saw Peter brace himself; but Kirk and Sellon <==
caught him as he sprang from under the death-swing of the pot. He
wrestled with them, panting and snarling.

"Let me go, blast you! Let me get at him! So you set a trap for me, did
you? Well, I killed him. The old brute cheated me. So did you, Aggie

Kirk was saying:

"Frank Crutchley, I arrest you..."

The rest of the words were lost in the prisoner's frenzied shouting.
==> Harriet went over and stood by the window. Peter had not moved. He left <==
Bunter and Puffett to help the police. Even with this assistance, they
had their work cut out to drag Crutchley from the room.

"Dear me!" said Mr. Goodacre. "This is a most shocking thing." He picked
up his surplice and stole.

[line number in individual story] matching line = 13558    window = 13553 13563

past her. "How horrible! Keep him off! To think that I ever let him come
near me!" Her small face was distorted with fury. She ran after them,
shaking her clenched fists and crying out grotesquely: "Beast! beast!
how dare you kill poor Uncle!"

==> The vicar turned to Harriet. <==

"Forgive me, Lady Peter. My duty is with that unhappy young man."

She nodded, and he followed the rest out of the room. Mrs. Ruddle,
arrested on her way to the door by the sight of the fishing-line

"Why, there!" she cried, triumphantly. "That's a funny thing, that is.
That's the way it was when I come in 'ere Wednesday morning to clear for
the sweep. I took it off meself and throwed it down on the floor."

==> She looked about her for approbation, but Harriet was past all power of <==
comment and Peter still stood unmoving. Gradually, Mrs. Ruddle realised
that the moment for applause had gone by, and shuffled out. Then from
the group in the doorway Sellon detached himself and came back, his
helmet askew and his tunic torn open at the throat.

"All right, Sellon. That'll do. Buzz off now like a good chap."

Sellon went out; and there was a pause.

==> "Peter," said Harriet. <==

He looked round, in time to see Crutchley hauled past the window, still
struggling in the four men's hands.

"Come and hold my hand," he said. "This part of the business always gets

==> Miss Harriet Vane, in those admirable detective novels with which she <==
was accustomed to delight the hearts of murder-fans (see blurb), usually
made a point of finishing off on a top-note. Mr. Robert Templeton, that
famous though eccentric sleuth, would unmask his murderer with a
flourish of _panache_ in the last chapter and retire promptly from the
stage amid a thunder of applause, leaving somebody else to cope with the

finished the job and left with their van. There had been difficulty and
delay in persuading them to leave without the wireless set; but here the
arm of the law at length prevailed. At last the police went away and
left them alone.

==> Harriet looked round the empty sitting-room with a curiously blank <==
sensation. There was nothing to sit on except the window-sill, so she
sat on that. Bunter was upstairs, locking trunks and suit-cases. Peter
walked aimlessly up and down the room.

"I'm going up to Town," he said abruptly. He looked vaguely at Harriet.

"I don't know what you'd care to do."

This was disconcerting, because she could not tell from his tone whether
he wanted her in London or not. She asked:

"I'd rather. I rang him up from Broxford. He's in the House to-night,
but he can see me if I go round after the debate on some Bill or other
he's concerned in. That will make it rather late for you, I'm afraid."

==> "Well," said Harriet, resolved to be reasonable whatever happened, "I <==
think you had better run me up to Town. Then we can sleep at an hotel,
if you like, or in your mother's house, if the servants are there; or if
you'd rather stay at your club, there's a friend I can always ring up;
or I can get out my own car and run down to Denver ahead of you."

"No, my lady, I regret to say I have not."

For nearly twenty years, Bunter had known no plans which did not include
the Piccadilly flat; and he was for once at a loss.

==> "I'll tell you what," said Harriet. "Go up to the vicarage and ask Mrs. <==
Goodacre from me whether we may leave it with her for a few days till we
have made our plans. She can then send it on, carriage forward. Make
some excuse for my not going myself. Or find me a piece of paper and I
will write a note. I would rather his lordship could find me here when
he wants me."

One felt rather shabby, perhaps, for not going to say _au revoir_ to the
Goodacres. But, quite apart from what Peter might or might not want, the
thought of Mrs. Goodacre's questions and Mr. Goodacre's lamentations was
a daunting one. When Bunter returned, bringing a cordial note of assent
from the vicar's wife, he reported that Miss Twitterton was also at the
==> parsonage, and Harriet was more than ever thankful to have escaped. <==

Mrs. Ruddle seemed to have disappeared. (She and Bert were, indeed,
having a sumptuous six o'clock tea with Mrs. Hodges and a few
neighbours, eager to have their news served up piping hot.) The only
person who lingered to bid them farewell was Mr. Puffett. He did not

"There's one thing," said Peter. "Over at Lopsley there's a sun-dial in
the old churchyard, made from one of our chimney-pots. I'm writing to
the squire to offer him a new sun-dial in exchange. May I tell him that
you will call for the old one and see to getting it put back?"

Sir Impey Biggs extricated himself from his debate about midnight. He

friend and connection that he was, and both with all proper
congratulations on their marriage. Although there had been no further
discussion of the subject, it had somehow been taken for granted that
there was now no more question of Harriet's going to sleep with a friend

Sir Impey Biggs extricated himself from his debate about midnight. He
greeted Harriet with a cheerful friendliness, Peter as the lifelong
friend and connection that he was, and both with all proper
congratulations on their marriage. Although there had been no further
discussion of the subject, it had somehow been taken for granted that
==> there was now no more question of Harriet's going to sleep with a friend <==
or driving to Denver alone. After dinner, Peter had merely said, "It's
no good going down to the House yet," and they had turned into a
news-cinema and seen a Mickey Mouse and an educational film about the
iron and steel industry.

"He must have had a disagreeable morning the day you arrived," said Sir
Impey. "Always supposing, of course, that this prosecution is justified.
I wonder he made no efforts, after the crime was discovered, to get the
chain removed."

==> "He did," said Harriet. "He came in three times while the <==
furniture-movers were there; and made a quite determined effort to get
me out of the room to investigate some tinned goods. I did go out once,
and met him in the passage, making for the sitting-room."

"Ah!" said Sir Impey. "And you'd be prepared to go into the box and

The Great North Road again, mile upon mile, through Hatfield, Stevenage,
Baldock, Biggleswade, north and east to the Hertfordshire border--the
same road they had travelled four days earlier, with Bunter sitting
behind and two-and-a-half dozen of port stowed under his feet in an
==> eiderdown. Harriet found herself dozing. Once, Peter's touch on her arm <==
roused her to hear him say, "That's the turn for Pagford...."
Huntingdon, Chatteris, March--still north and east, with the wind
blowing keener over the wide flats from the bitter northern sea, and the
greyness that heralds the dawn lifting coldly into the sky ahead.

spoke with the familiarity of long service. "We were expecting you any
time, and the sooner the better for us. Will this be her new ladyship?"

"Got it in one, Jenkins."

==> A woman appeared wrapping a shawl about her and curtsying. Harriet shook <==
hands with the pair of them.

"This is no way to bring your bride home, my lord," said Jenkins,
reprovingly. "We had the bells rung for you o'Tuesday, and we were
meaning to give you a good welcome when you came."

Inigo Jones."

                 *        *        *        *        *

==> Harriet, stumbling sleepily up the impeccable Inigo Jones staircase in <==
the wake of a tall footman, was aware of a scurry of high heels on the
landing and a cry of delight. The footman flattened himself swiftly
against the wall as the Dowager Duchess shot past him in a rose pink
dressing-gown, her white plaits flying and Ahasuerus clinging for dear
life to her shoulder.

Have a look round the library--you may find Cousin Matthew there, but
he's quite harmless, only very shy and slightly deaf."

The library, with its tall bays and overhanging gallery, looked east and
was already rather dark. Harriet found it restful. She wandered along

The library, with its tall bays and overhanging gallery, looked east and

pulling out here and there a calf-bound volume at random, sniffing the
sweet, musty odour of ancient books, smiling at a carved panel over one
of the fireplaces, on which the Wimsey mice had escaped from the coat of
arms and played in and out of a heavily undercut swag of flowers and
wheat-ears. A large table, littered deep in books and papers, she judged

to come upon an elderly gentleman, in a dressing-gown. He was standing
by the window, with a book in his hand, and the family features were so
clearly marked on him--especially the nose--that she could have no doubt
of his identity.

==> "Oh!" said Harriet, "I didn't know anyone was here. Are you----" Cousin <==
Matthew must have a surname, of course; the potty cousin at Nice was the
next heir, she remembered, after Gerald's and Peter's lines, so they
must be Wimseys--"are you Mr. Wimsey?" (Though, of course, he might
quite well be Colonel Wimsey, or Sir Matthew Wimsey, or even Lord
Somebody.) "I'm Peter's wife," she added, by way of explaining her

The elderly gentleman smiled very pleasantly and bowed, with a slight
wave of the hand as though to say, "Make yourself at home." He was
slightly bald, and his grey hair was cropped very closely above his ears
and over the temples. She judged him to be sixty-five or so. Having thus
==> made her free of the place, he returned to his book, and Harriet, seeing <==
that he seemed disinclined for conversation, and remembering that he was
deaf and shy, decided not to worry him. Five minutes later, she glanced
up from examining a number of miniatures displayed in a glass case, and
saw that he had made his escape and was, in fact, gazing down at her
from a little stair that ran up to the gallery. He bowed again and the

by the way; and there's tea going in the Blue Room. She wants you to
look at some china there. She's rather keen on china."

With the Duchess in the Blue Room was a slight, oldish man, rather
stooping, dressed neatly in an old-fashioned knicker-bocker suit, and
==> wearing spectacles and a thin grey beard like a goat's. As Harriet <==
entered, he rose from his chair and came forward with extended hand,
uttering a faint nervous bleat.

"Oh, hullo, Cousin Matthew!" cried Peter, heartily, clapping the old
gentleman smartly on the shoulder. "Come and be introduced to my wife.

"Not a _chapter_" said Cousin Matthew. "No. A few more pages. I'm afraid
I got rather led away upon a side-line of research. I _think_ I have got
upon the track of the elusive Simon--the twin, you know, who disappeared
and was supposed to have turned pirate."

==> "Have you, by jove? Sound work. Are these muffins? Harriet, I hope you <==
share my passion for muffins. I meant to find out before I married you,
but the opportunity never arose."

Harriet accepted the muffin, and said, turning to Cousin Matthew:

"I made a silly mistake just now. I met somebody in the library and
thought it must be you, and addressed him as Mr. Wimsey."

"Eh?" said Cousin Matthew. "What's that? Somebody in the library?"

"I thought everybody was away," said Peter.

"Perhaps Mr. Liddell came in to look up the _County Histories_"
suggested the Duchess. "Why didn't he ask them to give him tea?"

==> "I think it was someone living in the house," said Harriet, "because he <==
was in his dressing-gown. He's sixty-ish and a little bald on top, with
the rest of his hair very short, and he's rather like you,
Peter--side-face, anyhow."

"Oh, dear me," said the Duchess; "it must have been Old Gregory."

"Oh, dear me," said the Duchess; "it must have been Old Gregory."

"Good lord! so it must," agreed Peter, with his mouth full of muffin.
"Well, really now, I take that very kind of Old Gregory. He doesn't
usually venture out so early in the day--not for a visitor, at any rate.
==> It's a compliment to you, Harriet. Very decent of the old boy." <==

"Who is Old Gregory?"

"Let me see--he was some sort of cousin of the eighth--ninth--which duke
was it, Cousin Matthew?--the William-and-Mary one, anyway. He didn't

"Oh, come, Mother! That's pure invention. Why on earth should I be
wearing a hat on the terrace?"

Had it been possible to imagine either Peter or his mother capable of

said tentatively:

"This sounds almost too story-book."

"Not really," said Peter, "because it's all so pointless. They never

and given Uncle Roger the housemaid's pantry."

"That's what I told her," said the Duchess; and the conversation took
another turn.

==> Well, no! thought Harriet, sipping her second cup of tea; the idea of <==
being haunted by old Noakes was not likely to worry Peter much.

                 *        *        *        *        *

down by the lake.... They used to sell the white china, you know, to
amateur artists, and then it went back to be fired in the factory. It's
sensitive work, isn't it? Wimseys are either very sensitive, or not
sensitive at all, to things like painting and music."

==> She put her head on one side and looked up at Harriet over the rim of <==
the bowl with bright brown eyes like a bird's.

"I thought it might be rather like that," said Harriet, going back to
what the Duchess had really said. "I remember one time, when he'd just
finished up a case, he came out to dinner and really seemed quite ill."

"Well, that's nice of the man," said the Duchess, frankly, "because
sometimes these attached people _are_ rather difficult...and seeing that
if anybody can be said to have pulled Peter round again it was Bunter,
one might have to make allowances."

==> Harriet asked to be told about Bunter. <==

"Well," said the Duchess, "he was a footman at Sir John Sanderton's
before the War and he was in Peter's unit...sergeant or something
eventually...but they were in some--what's that American word for a
tight place?--jam, isn't it?--yes, some jam or other together, and took

hot plate on the sitting-room table and took all the polish off.... From
those sausages," concluded the Duchess, triumphantly, "I don't think
Peter ever looked back!"

==> Harriet thanked her mother-in-law for these particulars. "If there is a <==
crisis," she said, "when the Assizes come on, I'll take Bunter's advice.
Anyway, I'm very grateful to you for warning me. I'll promise not to be
wifely and solicitous--that would probably put the lid on."

family pew had crouching cats in place of the ordinary poppy-heads, in
compliment no doubt to the Wimsey crest. There was a chantry at the east
end of the south aisle, with canopied tombs. Wimseys again, she
supposed.)

The Dowager Duchess wrote that the furniture had been sent up to Talboys

But the house was habitable.

Crutchley refused to appeal, preferring to announce that he done it,
that he'd do it again, and let them get on with it, it made no odds to
him.

was quite the worst period of waiting in the world. A prisoner should be
executed the morning after his conviction, as after a court-martial, so
that one could get all the misery over in a lump and have done with it.
Or the business should be left to drag on for months and years, as in
America, till one was so weary of it as to have exhausted all emotion.

"Perhaps not; but one undiscovered murder makes many. However, that

Peter said he thought Crutchley ought at least to be told about it. He
thought it was only fair that the man should be given the chance to do
what he could. He offered to take Mrs. Mason over to see the governor of
the prison. Mrs. Goodacre said it was very good of him.

==> Harriet, escorting Mrs. Goodacre down the path to the gate, said it <==
would do her husband good to have something definite to do about
Crutchley: he worried a good deal.

"Very likely he does," said Mrs. Goodacre. "You can see he's that sort.

Peter reported in the evening that Crutchley had been very angry and
refused categorically to have anything further to do with Polly or any
more blasted women. He had, in fact, refused to see either Mrs. Mason or
Peter or anybody else, and had told the governor to damn' well leave him
alone. Peter then began to worry about what ought to be done for the

merit of being a practical one) and then said:

"Couldn't you put Miss Climpson on to it? With all her High-Church
connections she ought to be able to hear of some job that would do. I've

"Yes. Bunter, his lordship has particularly said he does not wish me to
sit up for him. But if he should return to-night, and he doesn't...if he
should be very restless..." That sentence did not seem to be ending

reluctantly and enter the next room. She feared they might stop there,
but this time he came straight on and pushed open the door which she had

He came over and stood close beside her, mute and shivering. She put her
