                 SURPRISING METAMORPHOSIS OF MR. BREDON

==> Lord Peter Wimsey had paid a call upon Chief-Inspector Parker of <==
Scotland Yard, who was his brother-in-law.

He occupied a large and comfortable arm-chair in the Chief-Inspector's
Bloomsbury flat. Opposite him, curled upon the chesterfield, was his
sister, Lady Mary Parker, industriously knitting an infant's vest. On

patronized her wealthy brother with all the superiority which the worker
feels over the man who merely possesses money.

"But what _is_ the case all about, exactly?" demanded Parker.

==> "Blest if I know," admitted Wimsey, frankly. "I got hauled into it <==
through Freddy Arbuthnot's wife--Rachel Levly that was, you know. She
knows old Pym, and he met her at dinner somewhere and told her about
this letter that was worrying him, and she said, Why not get somebody in
to investigate it, and he said, Who? So she said she knew somebody--not
mentioning my name, you see--and he said would she ask me to buzz along,

don't know. Perhaps it's an instinct to hold on to what one's got. But
equally it's an instinct to try and save one's self. I don't know. All
this arguing about what you and I would do and what the reasonable man
would do is very unsatisfactory."

==> Wimsey groaned. "Put it this way, doubting Thomas. If the death-grip was <==
due to instantaneous rigor, he must have been dead so quickly that he
couldn't think of saving himself. Now, there are two possible causes of
death--the broken neck, which he must have got when he pitched on his
head at the bottom, and the crack on the temple, which is attributed to
his hitting his skull on one of the knobs on the banisters. Now, falling

obviously was, except Victor Dean, poor lad. It's safe as houses."

"Very well, then. Find out if any member of the staff has frequently
stayed in at lunch-time."

==> Wimsey shook his head. <==

"No bon. The staff clock in every morning, but there are no special tabs
kept on them at 1 o'clock. The reception clerk goes out to his lunch,
and one of the elder boys takes his place at the desk, just in case any
message or parcel comes in, but he's not there necessarily every moment

to get to Mr. Pym, at all; it was just a threat. The other man stops him
for the moment by paying up something on account. Then he thinks: 'This
is hopeless, I'd better slug the little beast.' So he slugs him. And
there you are."

==> "Just as simple as that," said Wimsey. <==

"Of course it's simple, only men love to make mysteries."

"And women love to jump to conclusions."

arrest the other night. They'll probably get seven years."

"Good. I was pretty nearly had that time, though. Two of Pym's typists
were fooling round and recognized me. I gave them a fishy stare and
explained next morning that I had a cousin who closely resembled me.
==> That notorious fellow Wimsey, of course. It's a mistake to be too well <==
known."

"If the de Momerie crowd get wise to you, you'll find yourself in Queer
Street," said Parker. "How did you get so pally with Dian?"

different! Be hectored into health and prosperity! Never let up! Never
go to sleep! Never be satisfied. If once you are satisfied, all our
wheels will run down. Keep going--and if you can't, Try Nutrax for
Nerves!

apparently for the express purpose of taking it off to her when he
emerged.

In a taxi rolling south-west, Mr. Bredon removed his spectacles, combed
out his side-parting, stuck a monocle in his eye, and by the time he

wonder he gazed upon the twinkling sky-signs, as though, ignorant
astronomer, he knew nothing of the creative hands that had set these
lesser lights to rule the night.

in. He switched on the light and hunted in the little glass-fronted box
labelled "Flat 3--Parker" for letters. He found a bill and a circular
and deduced, quite correctly, that his wife had been at home all evening
and too tired or too slack to go down to fetch the 9.30 post. He was
turning to go upstairs, when he remembered that there might be a letter
==> for Wimsey, under the name of Bredon, in the box belonging to Flat 4. As <==
a rule, of course, this box was not used, but when Wimsey had begun his
impersonation at Pym's, his brother-in-law had provided him with a key
to fit it and had embellished the box itself with a written label
"Bredon," for the better information of the postman.

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 82101    window = 82096 82106



There was one letter in the "Bredon" box--the kind that novelists used
to call a "dainty missive"; that is to say, the envelope was tinted
mauve, had a gilt deckle-edge and was addressed in a flourishing
feminine handwriting. Parker took it out, intending to enclose it with a
==> note which he was sending to Wimsey in the morning, pushed it into his <==
pocket and went on up to the first floor. Here he switched out the
hall-light which, like the staircase lights, was fitted with two-way
wiring, and proceeded to the second floor, containing Flat 3, which
comprised his living-room, dining-room and kitchen. Here he hesitated,
but, rather unfortunately for himself, decided that he did not really

"You'd grumble all right," said Parker, "with a bust collar-bone and a
headache like nothing on earth and a feeling as though bulls of Bashan
had been trampling on your tummy."

==> "It beats me," said Wimsey, "the way these policemen give way over a <==
trifling accident. In the Sexton Blake book that my friend Ginger Joe
has just lent me, the great detective, after being stunned with a piece
of lead-piping and trussed up for six hours in ropes which cut his flesh
nearly to the bone, is taken by boat on a stormy night to a remote house
on the coast and flung down a flight of stone steps into a stone cellar.

"Yes--one of those pocket propelling things--not a wooden one--you
needn't hope for a handy mould of his front teeth on it, or anything
like that."

"All right; you can see it if you like. I've tried it for finger-prints,
but I can't get much--only vague smudges, very much superimposed. I've
had our finger-print wallah round to look at 'em, but he doesn't seem to
have made anything of 'em. See if you can find the pencil, Mary dear,

"That's funny," he said. "I know it was there. One of those fancy
long-shaped mauve envelopes with gilt edges, and a lady's fist, rather
sprawly."

==> "Oh!" said Wimsey, "the letter's gone, has it?" His eyes glinted with <==
excitement. "That's very remarkable. And what's more, Charles, this
isn't a Woolworth pencil--it's one of Darling's."

"I meant Darling's--same thing. Anybody might carry one of them."

excitement. "That's very remarkable. And what's more, Charles, this
isn't a Woolworth pencil--it's one of Darling's."

"I meant Darling's--same thing. Anybody might carry one of them."

==> "Ah!" said Wimsey, "but this is where my expert knowledge comes in. <==
Darling's don't sell these pencils--they give them away. Anybody buying
more than a pound's worth of goods gets a pencil as a good-conduct
prize. You observe that it carries an advertising slogan: IT ISN'T DEAR,
IT'S DARLING. (One of Pym's best efforts, by the way.) The idea is that,
every time you make a note on your shopping list, you are reminded of

"Well, I'm dashed!" exclaimed Lady Mary, "do you mean to say that it's
really you, you devil, who ought to be lying there mangled and bruised
in the place of my afflicted husband?"

==> "I think so," said Wimsey, with satisfaction, "I certainly do think so. <==
Particularly as the assailant seems to have walked off with my private
correspondence. I know who--or to be grammatical, whom--that letter was
from, by the way."

"Who?" demanded Parker, disregarding the grammatical nicety.

"A very great pity," agreed Mr. Parker, with feeling.

"Still, it might have been worse. We've got three lines to go upon. The
people who heard about the catapult. The people who knew, or inquired
for, my address. And, of course, the bloke who's lost his pencil. But, I
==> say--" Wimsey broke off with a shout of laughter--"what a shock it must <==
have been for whoever it was when I turned up this morning without so
much as a black eye! Why in the name of creation didn't you let me have
all the details first thing this morning, so that I could have kept a
look-out?"

"Besides, we didn't think it had anything to do with you."

"You should have guessed. Wherever trouble turns up, there am I at the
bottom of it. But I'll overlook it this time. You have been sufficiently
==> punished, and no one shall say that a Wimsey could not be magnanimous. <==
But this blighter--you didn't manage to mark him, Charles, did you?"

"Afraid not. I got a clutch on his beastly throat, but he was all
muffled up."

"So it will, by Jove! Well, look here, old boy, I'm really fearfully
sorry you copped that packet that was meant for me. It's perfectly
damnable luck and I'm dashed thankful it was no worse. I'll buzz off
now. I've got to, anyhow. I've got a date. So-long."

==> Wimsey's first action after leaving the flat was to ring up Pamela Dean, <==
whom he fortunately found at home. He explained that her letter had been
lost in transmission, and asked what was in it.

"Only a note from Dian de Momerie. She wants to know who you are. You
seem to have made a remarkable hit."

"Good-night--Yellow-Dog Dingo."

"Bung-ho!"

purpose. Except, of course, when you particularly want them to be
yielding."

He grinned with a wry mouth, and went out to keep his date with the one

They are strapping his elbows and dropping a white bag over his head.
The hanged man. There's a hanged man in your thoughts. Why are you
thinking of hanging?"

She shrank away from him and huddled into the farthest corner of the
==> car. Wimsey re-started the engine and let in the clutch. <==

"Upon my word," he thought, "that's the oddest after-effect of drink and
drugs I've met yet. Very interesting. But not very safe. Quite a
providential interposition in one way. We may get home without breaking
our necks. I didn't know I carried such a graveyard aura about with me."

He kissed her gently this time and pushed her into the house. The

"Good morning, officer."

"Morning, sir," said the policeman, stolidly.

             INEXCUSABLE INVASION OF A DUCAL ENTERTAINMENT

==> To Lord Peter Wimsey, the few weeks of his life spent in unravelling the <==
Problem of the Iron Staircase possessed an odd dreamlike quality,
noticeable at the time and still more insistent in retrospect. The very
work that engaged him--or rather, the shadowy simulacrum of himself that
signed itself on every morning in the name of Death Bredon--wafted him
into a sphere of dim platonic archetypes, bearing a scarcely

What connection was there? What had Dean, at Pym's, had to do with
Milligan, before Milligan knew him? Was it merely that Dian had boasted,
laughing, of having a lover from that respectable agency? Had Victor
Dean died merely because of Dian's fancy for him?

==> Wimsey could not believe it; the fancy had died first, and the death of <==
Dean was, after that, surely superfluous. Besides, when they of the city
of night slay for passion's sake, they lay no elaborate schemes, wipe
off no finger-prints and hold no discreet tongues before or after.
Brawls and revolver-shots, with loud sobs and maudlin remorse, are the
signs and tokens of fatal passion among leaders of the bright life.

it. He could only wait, like a cat at a mouse-hole, till something
popped out that he could run after. And so he passed his nights very
wearily, driving the car and playing upon a penny whistle, and snatching
his sleep in the small hours, before taking up the daily grind at Pym's.

==> Wimsey was quite right about Dian de Momerie's feeling for him. He <==
excited her and frightened her, and, on the whole, she got a sensation
of rather titillating horror at the sound of the penny whistle. But the
real reason of her anxiety to propitiate him was founded on a
coincidence that he could not have known and that she did not tell him.

She was just raising a well-earned glass of champagne to her lips when
she paused, and set it down again. Something was wrong. She glanced
hurriedly round for her husband. He was not there, but a few paces off
an elegant black back and smooth, straw-coloured head of hair announced

"Ask Bracket how he came to let them in."

He finished the drink he had in his hand, and set off in a leisurely

"Bracket says they came with Freddy Arbuthnot."

"You will do nothing of the sort, Freddy. Where in the world is Gerald?
Not here. He never is when he's wanted. You'll have to go and turn them

they?"

pillar-rose fell across his face and chequered his white shirt-front
with dancing black; and as he went he whistled softly: "Tom, Tom, the

Dian de Momerie clutched Milligan's arm as she turned.

Duchess on a--forgive me--somewhat distasteful errand. She regrets that
she has not the honour of this lady's acquaintance, nor, sir, of yours,

know you are. I know your voice perfectly well--and your mouth and chin.
Besides, you were whistling that tune."

==> "This is very interesting," said Wimsey. "Is it possible--I fear it <==
is--I think you must have encountered my unfortunate cousin Bredon."

"That was the name--" began Dian, uncertainly, and stopped.

"I am glad to hear it," replied Wimsey. "Sometimes he gives mine, which

"This is very interesting," said Wimsey. "Is it possible--I fear it

"That was the name--" began Dian, uncertainly, and stopped.

makes it very awkward."

"See here, Dian," broke in Milligan, "you seem to have dropped a brick.
You'd better apologize and then we'll clear. Sorry we crashed in, and
all that--"

You'd better apologize and then we'll clear. Sorry we crashed in, and
all that--"

==> "One moment," said Wimsey. "I should like to hear more about this. Be <==
good enough to come into the house for a moment. This way."

He ushered them courteously round the corner of the terrace, up a side
path and by way of a French window into a small ante-room, laid out with
tables and a cocktail bar.

through putting whisky on top of gin cocktails. Two stiff whiskies,
Tomlin, and a liqueur brandy."

"Very good, my lord."

==> "You perceive," said Wimsey, returning with the drinks, "the true object <==
of this hospitable gesture. I have established my identity, by the
evidence of the reliable Tomlin. Let us now seek a spot less open to
interruption. I suggest the library. This way. My brother, being an
English gentleman, possesses a library in all his houses, though he
never opens a book. This is called fidelity to ancient tradition. The

"One moment," said Milligan, before Dian could speak. "I think I know
the stud-book pretty well. I was not aware that you had a cousin
Bredon."

==> "It is not every puppy that appears in the kennel-book," replied Wimsey <==
carelessly, "and it is a wise man that knows all his own cousins. But
what matter? Family is family, though indicated by the border compony
(or gobony if you prefer that form of the word) or by the bend or baton
sinister, called by most writers of fiction the bar sinister, for
reasons which I am unable to determine. My regrettable cousin Bredon,

"No; he was brought by a lady of my acquaintance."

"He is improving. Major Milligan, painful though it may be to me, I feel
that I ought to warn you against that cousin of mine. He is definitely
not nice to know. If he has been thrusting his attentions upon Miss de
==> Momerie, it is probably with some ulterior object. Not," added Wimsey, <==
"that any man would need an ulterior object for such attentions. Miss de
Momerie is an object in herself--"

His eye wandered over Dian, scantily clothed and slightly intoxicated,
with a cold appraisement which rendered the words almost impertinent.

escapade."

"All right, I'll tell you," said Dian. The whisky had strung her up to
recklessness, and she became suddenly voluble, disregarding Milligan's
scowls. She poured out the tale of her adventures. The incident of the
==> fountain-dive seemed to cause Lord Peter Wimsey acute distress. <==

"Vulgar ostentation!" he said, shaking his head. "How many times have I
implored Bredon to conduct himself in a quiet and reasonable manner."

"I thought he was too marvellous," said Dian, and proceeded to relate

the encounter in the wood.

"He always plays 'Tom, Tom, the piper's son,' so of course, when you
came along whistling it, I thought it was him."

==> Wimsey's face darkened in a most convincing manner. <==

"Disgusting," he said.

"Besides, you are so much alike--the same voice and the same face as far
as one can see it, you know. But of course he never took off his mask--"

"Disgusting," he said.

"Besides, you are so much alike--the same voice and the same face as far
as one can see it, you know. But of course he never took off his mask--"

police are interested in my cousin Bredon."

"How thrilling!"

"What for?" demanded Milligan.

"How thrilling!"

"What for?" demanded Milligan.

==> "For impersonating me, among other things," said Wimsey, now happily <==
launched and well away. "I cannot tell you in the brief time at our
disposal, the distress and humiliation I have been put to on Bredon's
account. Bailing him out at police stations--honouring cheques drawn in
my name--rescuing him from haunts of infamy--I am telling you all these
distressing details in confidence, of course."

my name--rescuing him from haunts of infamy--I am telling you all these
distressing details in confidence, of course."

"We won't split," said Dian.

==> "He trades upon our unfortunate resemblance," went on Wimsey. "He copies <==
my habits, smokes my favourite brand of cigarettes, drives a car like
mine, even whistles my favourite air--one, I may say, peculiarly well
adapted for performance upon the penny whistle."

"He must be pretty well off," said Dian, "to drive a car like that."

mine, even whistles my favourite air--one, I may say, peculiarly well
adapted for performance upon the penny whistle."

"He must be pretty well off," said Dian, "to drive a car like that."

==> "_That_," said Wimsey, "is the most melancholy thing of all. I suspect <==
him--but perhaps I had better not say anything about that."

"Oh, do tell," urged Dian, her eyes dancing with excitement. "It sounds
too terribly breath-taking."

him--but perhaps I had better not say anything about that."

"Oh, do tell," urged Dian, her eyes dancing with excitement. "It sounds
too terribly breath-taking."

==> "I suspect him," said Wimsey, in solemn and awful tones, "of having to <==
do with--_smug-druggling_--_I_ mean, dash it all--drug-smuggling."

"You don't say so," said Milligan.

"Well, I can't prove it. But I have received warnings from a certain

"You don't say so," said Milligan.

"Well, I can't prove it. But I have received warnings from a certain
==> quarter. You understand me." Wimsey selected a fresh cigarette and <==
tapped it, with the air of one who has closed the coffin-lid upon a dead
secret and is nailing it down securely. "I don't want to interfere in
your affairs in any way at all, Major Milligan. I trust that I shall
never be called upon to do so." Here he transfixed Milligan with another
hard stare. "But you will perhaps allow me to give you, and this lady, a

"I think you're talking rot," said Dian. "Why, you can't even get him
to--"

"Cigarette, Dian?" interrupted Milligan, rather sharply.

==> "I do not say," resumed Wimsey, raking Dian slowly with his eyes, and <==
then turning again to Milligan, "that my deplorable cousin is himself an
addict to cocaine or heroin or anything of that description. In some
ways, it would be almost more respectable if he were. The man or woman
who can batten on the weaknesses of his fellow-creatures without sharing
them is, I admit, to me a singularly disgusting object. I may be

them is, I admit, to me a singularly disgusting object. I may be
old-fashioned, but there it is."

"Quite so," said Milligan.

==> "I do not know, and do not wish to know," went on Wimsey, "how you came <==
to allow my cousin Bredon into your house, nor what, on his side, can
have brought him there. I prefer not to suppose that he found there any
other attraction than good drinks and good company. You may think, Major
Milligan, that because I have interested myself in certain police cases,
I am a consistent busybody. That is not the case. Unless I am forced to

"Of course, I'm frightfully glad to know all about it," said Dian. "Your
cousin sounds a perfect lamb. I like 'em dangerous. Pompous people are
too terribly moribund, aren't they?"

==> Wimsey bowed. <==

"My dear lady, your choice of friends is entirely at your own
discretion."

"I'm glad to hear it. I got the impression that the Duchess wasn't too

"Quite right," said Milligan. "We have trespassed on your hospitality
too long. We must really apologize and remove ourselves. By the way,
there were some other members of our party--"

"I expect my sister-in-law will have dealt with them by now," said
==> Wimsey with a grin. "If not, I will make a point of seeing them and <==
telling them that you have gone on to--where shall I say?"

Dian gave her own address.

"You'd better come round and have a drink, too," she suggested.

Dian gave her own address.

"You'd better come round and have a drink, too," she suggested.

==> "Alas!" said Wimsey, "duty and all that sort of thing, what? Can't leave <==
my sister-in-law in the lurch, greatly as I should enjoy the
entertainment." He rang the bell. "You will excuse me now, I trust. I
must see to our other guests. Porlock, show this lady and gentleman
out."

                 HOPEFUL CONSPIRACY OF TWO BLACK SHEEP

The gentleman in the harlequin costume removed his mask with quiet
deliberation, and laid it on the table.

==> "Since," he said, "my virtuous cousin Wimsey has let the cat out of the <==
bag, I may as well take this off. I am afraid"--he turned to Dian--"my
appearance will disappoint you. Except that I am handsomer and less
rabbity-looking, the woman who has seen Wimsey has seen me. It is a
heavy handicap to carry, but I can't help it. The resemblance, I am
happy to say, is only skin-deep."

[line number in individual story] matching line = 9407    window = 9402 9412

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 87297    window = 87292 87302


deliberation, and laid it on the table.

"It's almost incredible," said Major Milligan. He bent forward to
examine the other's face more closely, but Mr. Bredon extended a languid

examine the other's face more closely, but Mr. Bredon extended a languid
arm and, without apparently using any force at all, pushed him back into
his seat.

"You needn't come too close," he observed, insolently. "Even a face like
==> Wimsey's is better than yours. Yours is spotty. You eat and drink too <==
much."

Major Milligan, who had, indeed, been distressed that morning by the
discovery of a few small pimples on his forehead, but had hoped they
were not noticeable, grunted angrily. Dian laughed.

I think it sounds more picturesque when rhymed with breath. What did my
amiable cousin say about me?"

"He said you were a dope-runner."

==> "Where my cousin Wimsey gets his information from, I am damned if I <==
know. Sometimes he is correct."

"And you know perfectly well that one can get what one wants at Tod's
place. So why not come to the point?"

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 87433    window = 87428 87438



"Yes."

"How did that happen?"

==> "I received information, as my dear cousin Wimsey's police pals would <==
say, that Dean was on to something fishy about Pym's. So, since most
fish have gold in their mouths like St. Peter's, I thought it wouldn't
do any harm to try a cast or two over that particular pool."

"And what did you find?"

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 87553    window = 87548 87558



"I'm going to tell you what I know," he said. "If you double-cross me,
it's at your own risk. I don't want any funny business with that damned
cousin of yours."

==> Mr. Bredon expressed his opinion of Lord Peter Wimsey in a few <==
well-chosen words.

"All right," said Milligan. "You have been warned. Now, see here. If we
can find out who works this thing and how it's worked, we can get in at
the top. It pays fairly well as it is, in one way, but it's a devil of a

Tod, _did_ you kill Victor Dean?"

"I did not."

Major Milligan dreamed that night that Death Bredon, in his harlequin

destination, and proved to belong to a distinguished member of the
diplomatic corps, engaged on extremely incognito visits to a lady
established in a popular seaside resort. Mr. Parker, still incapacitated
from personal attendance upon midnight expeditions, was left with the
gloomy satisfaction of saying that everything always went wrong when he
==> wasn't there himself. He was also unreasonably annoyed with Wimsey, as <==
the original cause of his incapacity.

Nor had the investigation at the White Swan so far borne very much
fruit. For a week in succession, tactful and experienced policemen had
draped themselves over its bar, chatting to all and sundry about

to them. It was not, however, unusual for gentlemen in dress clothes to
drop in at the Swan by way of a good finish to a lively night--or for
gentlemen without dress clothes, either. Nothing threw any light on the
mystery of the packet of cocaine.

==> Parker was, however, roused to some enthusiasm by Wimsey's report of his <==
conversations with Milligan.

"What incredible luck you do have, Peter. People who, in the ordinary
way, would avoid you like the plague, gate-crash into your parties at
the psychological moment and offer you their noses to lead them by."

"What incredible luck you do have, Peter. People who, in the ordinary
way, would avoid you like the plague, gate-crash into your parties at
the psychological moment and offer you their noses to lead them by."

==> "Not so much luck, old man," said Wimsey. "Good guidance, that's all. I <==
sent the fair Dian an anonymous letter, solemnly warning her against
myself and informing her that if she wanted to know the worst about me,
she had only to inquire at my brother's address. It's a curious thing,
but people _cannot_ resist anonymous letters. It's like free sample
offers. They appeal to all one's lower instincts."

himself--but suppose we punish him here and now. They'd only start
again, with a new distributor and a new house for him to run his show
in, and what would anybody gain by that?"

==> "Exactly," said Wimsey. "And how much better off will you be, even if <==
you catch the man above Milligan? The same thing will apply."

Parker made a hopeless gesture.

"I don't know, Peter. It's no good worrying about it. My job is to catch

"I don't know, Peter. It's no good worrying about it. My job is to catch
the heads of the gangs if I can, and, after that, as many as possible of
the little people. I can't overthrow cities and burn the population."

==> "'Tis the Last Judgment's fire must cure this place," said Wimsey, <==
"calcine its clods and set its prisoners free. There are times, Charles,
when even the unimaginative decency of my brother and the malignant
virtue of his wife appear to me admirable. I could hardly say more."

"You have a certain decency of your own, Peter," replied Parker, "which

moment I must say you are not being very helpful. You have been
investigating a crime--if it is a crime--for some weeks now, and the
only tangible result is a broken collar-bone for me. If you could
confine yourself to breaking your own collar-bone--"

==> "It has been broken before now," said Wimsey, "and in no less good a <==
cause. You shouldn't shove your beastly collar-bone into my affairs."

At this moment, the telephone-bell rang.

It was half-past eight in the morning, and Wimsey had been consuming an

to his own place of business. Lady Mary, who had been supplying their
bodily necessities and leaving them to their argument, took up the
receiver.

which ended with his saying:

"Send Lumley and Eagles along at once, and tell Puncheon to keep in
touch with you. I'm coming."

==> "What's up?" inquired Wimsey. <==

"Our little friend Puncheon has seen his bloke in dress clothes again,"
said Parker, cursing as he tried to get his coat over his damaged
shoulder. "Saw him hanging about the _Morning Star_ offices this
morning, buying an early paper or something. Been chasing him ever

couldn't get on to the 'phone before. I must push off. See you later.
Cheerio, Mary dear. Bung-ho, Peter."

He bounced out in a hurry.

==> "Well, well," said Wimsey. He pushed back his chair and sat staring <==
vacantly at the wall opposite, on which hung a calendar. Then, emptying
the sugar-bowl on the table-cloth with a jerk, he began, frowning
hideously, to built a lofty tower with its contents. Mary recognized the
signs of inspiration and stole quietly away to her household duties.

possibility of Whiffledom struck him like a sledge-hammer. Fired with
excitement, he hurled himself at his desk, snatched a scribbling-block,
and had written the word "WHIFFLE" in capitals an inch high, when Miss
Rossiter arrived with the message that Mr. Parker urgently requested Mr.

intimately in the skin of Mr. Death Bredon that he said: "Damn!" loudly
and heartily.

Nevertheless, he obeyed the call, presented himself with leave of
absence on urgent private business, and went down to Scotland Yard,

Parker. "Perhaps a photograph in some of the London and provincial
papers would be as well. I loathe newspapers, but they do advertise
one's requirements, and some of these laundry-marks may come from
outside London...."

==> Wimsey looked at him. <==

"Advertisement, my dear Charles, may be desirable in the case of
laundries, but for people like ourselves it does not exist. A gentleman
whose clothes are so well cut, and who yet deprives his tailor of the
credit for them is, like ourselves, not of the advertising sort. This, I

And Mr. Mountjoy didn't trouble about the fashion of his hats. There was
one particular shape he fancied, and he had all his hats specially made
to that pattern."

it was well to check matters up. He reflected that he had never yet

            ECCENTRIC BEHAVIOUR OF A POST-OFFICE DEPARTMENT

lordship, whose mind was still divided between detection and the new

Parker whistled.

"That's what you think, is it?"

and lethargy after meals? Try Sparkletone, the invigorating vegetable

accidental to be true. When a gentleman removes his tailor's tab and

"No; he'd not leave it so late. Tell me again about the flat."

Parker patiently repeated the account of his visit and the interviews

his chair and was listening with fascinated attention.

"Charles! What imbeciles we are! Of course, that's it!"

"What's what?"

due to be issued. One man went further. His name was Barrington, and he
had only recently moved in. He had inquired when the new A-K volume
would be out with his new 'phone number, and had been told that it would
probably be issued in October.

==> "That settles it," said Wimsey. "Our friend Mountjoy kept his secrets in <==
the telephone directory. That great work contains advertisements,
post-office regulations and names and addresses, but particularly names
and addresses. May we conclude that the secret nestled among the names
and addresses? I think we may."

revealed that the old directories had already been dispatched by the
sackful to the pulping-mills, but had not, so far, been pulped. Six
workers, toiling over the week-end among L-Z volumes collected from the
Kensington District, brought to light the pleasing fact that nine people
out of ten marked their directories in some way or another. Reports came
==> pouring in. Wimsey sat with Parker in the latter's office at Scotland <==
Yard and considered these reports.

Late on Sunday night, Wimsey raised his head from a sheaf of papers.

"I think this is it, Charles."

Parker glanced through the report.

Piccadilly Tube Station, and started off on a wild scamper across
London."

"That was how the gang came to be ready for him."

"I want a word with you, Bredon. I'd almost forgotten what you were
really here for. Has any progress been made in that matter?"

along the distance of his mind. "In fact, the investigation is turning
out to be of so much importance that I don't quite know how I can take
even you into my confidence."

"That's nonsense," said Mr. Pym. "I am employing you--"

staff, it makes a difference. The firm's name might even be kept out of

Bredon--"

==> "I can't tell you," said Wimsey; "a few days ago, I thought I knew, but <==
just lately, other facts have come to my knowledge which suggest that
the man I originally suspected may not be the right one. And until I

Chief-Inspector wants to know whether you can hold your tongue, Mr.
Pym."

"I only wish to God everybody could hold his tongue," groaned Mr. Pym.

==> Wimsey passed on the reply. "I think I'll risk it, Charles. If anybody <==
is going to be slugged in the dark after this, it won't be you, and I
can look after myself."

He rang off and turned to Mr. Pym.

Miss Meteyard said nothing. She went downstairs to the Executive and
borrowed the current volume of _Who's Who_. She ran her finger through
the W's, till she came to the entry beginning: "WIMSEY, Peter Death

Mr. Tallboy's stockbroker inhabited a small tobacconist's shop, the name
over which was not Smith but Cummings.

==> "An accommodation address," observed Lord Peter Wimsey. "Most unusual <==
for a stockbroker. Let us probe this matter further."

He entered the shop, which was narrow, confined and exceedingly dark. An
elderly man stepped forward to serve him. Wimsey went immediately to the
point.

from me."

==> "I'm very sorry," said Wimsey. "There seems to be some mistake." <==

"Mistake?" said Mr. Cummings, angrily. "I don't believe it's a mistake
at all. It's a stupid practical joke, that's what it is. And I'm fed up

he noticed, had a pair of very sharp eyes behind his glasses. A thought
struck him.

And I don't want any of your sauce, neither."

A little pressure at head-quarters produced what was required. The
postmen who carried letters to Old Broad Street were found and
interrogated. It was quite true that they frequently delivered letters
for a Mr. Smith to Mr. Cummings' shop, and that these letters invariably
were returned, and marked "Not known." Where did they go then? To the

unavoidably detained, and sought the Returned Letter Office. After a
little delay, he found the official who knew all about it.

The letters for Mr. Smith came regularly every week. They were never
returned to the sender in the ordinary course. Why? Because they bore no

and destroyed. Would they keep the next one that arrived and send it on

On leaving the office at 5.30, he walked down Southampton Row to

He mounted the stairs obediently and found Peterkin, aged three,

of dope to Major Milligan. It never turned up."

"Do you, Polly? Well, so do I. But I wasn't sure if it would sound

Mr. Parker cursed solidly enough on his return.

But we'll pull it off next week--if we live so long."

pitch in gallant response to an impossible call by Mr. Beeseley, was run
out, after compiling a laborious 12. Mr. Bredon, pacing serenely to the
wicket, took counsel with himself. He reminded himself that he was
still, in the eyes of Pym's and Brotherhood's at any rate, Mr. Death
Bredon of Pym's. A quiet and unobtrusive mediocrity, he decided, must be
==> his aim. Nothing that could recall the Peter Wimsey of twenty years <==
back, making two centuries in successive innings for Oxford. No fancy
cuts. Nothing remarkable. On the other hand, he had claimed to be a
cricketer. He must not make a public exhibition of incompetence. He
decided to make twenty runs, not more and, if possible, not less.

"They draw stumps at 6.30; try and stick it out till then if you can."

Mr. Bredon nodded. The advice suited him excellently. A nice, quiet,
defensive game was exactly the game least characteristic of Peter

moments in arranging himself, and faced the bowling with an expression
of bland expectation.

All would probably have gone according to calculation, but for the
circumstance that the bowler at the garden end of the field was a man

Nothing makes a man see red like a sharp rap over the funny-bone, and it
was at this moment that Mr. Death Bredon suddenly and regrettably forgot
himself. He forgot his caution and his rôle, and Mr. Miller's braces,
and saw only the green turf and the Oval on a sunny day and the squat
majesty of the gas-works. The next ball was another of Simmonds'
==> murderous short-pitched bumpers, and Lord Peter Wimsey, opening up <==
wrathful shoulders, strode out of his crease like the spirit of
vengeance and whacked it to the wide. The next he clouted to leg for
three, nearly braining square-leg and so flummoxing deep-field that he
flung it back wildly to the wrong end, giving the Pymmites a fourth for
an overthrow. Mr. Simmonds' last ball he treated with the contempt it

now."

Mr. Haagedorn asked nothing better. He would run till he burst, or stand
still till he hardened into marble, if only he could keep this miracle

the over with a well-placed three, which left him still in possession of
the bowling. He walked down the pitch and Haagedorn came to meet him.

"I'll take everything I can," said Wimsey, "but if anything comes to

There followed lengthy and picturesque descriptions of the arrest;
pictures of the place where the body was found; articles on Lord Peter

night-life in London and on penny whistles. The Duke of Denver had been
interviewed, but refused to say anything; Lord Peter Wimsey, on the
other hand, had said a good deal. Finally--and this puzzled Miss
Meteyard very much, there was a photograph of Lord Peter and of Death
Bredon standing side by side.

had that indefinable air of raffish insolence which is the hall-mark of
the _chevalier d'industrie_. The newspaper article wandered on to give
various unverifiable details.

"Bredon never went to a university, though he sometimes claims Oxford as

At 1 o'clock Miss Meteyard went out to lunch, and read in the _Evening

a.m. on the murder charge, and had reserved his defence. At 10.30, Lord

injury, owing to his horse's having been startled by a back-fire from a

On Tuesday morning, Mr. Willis arrived at the office late and in a great

Ginger Joe's eyes nearly popped out of his head.

It was not until Thursday evening that Miss Meteyard made up her mind to
speak to Mr. Tallboy.

               APPROPRIATE EXIT OF AN UNSKILLED MURDERER

==> "Is Lord Peter Wimsey at home?" <==

The manservant raked his questioner with a swift glance, which took in
everything from his hunted eyes to his respectable middle-class boots.
Then he said, inclining a respectful head:

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 91268    window = 91263 91273


"If you will be good enough to take a seat, I will ascertain if his
Lordship is at leisure. What name shall I say, sir?"

"Mr. Tallboy."

==> "Who, Bunter?" said Wimsey. "Mr. Tallboy? This is a little embarrassing. <==
What does he look like?"

"He looks, my lord, if I may so poetically express myself, as though the
Hound of Heaven had got him, so to say, cornered, my lord."

"Very likely. Well, it can't be helped. Show him in."

"Very good, my lord."

==> The young man came in and Wimsey rose to greet him. <==

"Good evening, Mr. Tallboy."

"I have come," began Tallboy, and then broke off. "Lord
Peter--Bredon--for God's sake, which are you?"

"Good evening, Mr. Tallboy."

"I have come," began Tallboy, and then broke off. "Lord
Peter--Bredon--for God's sake, which are you?"

"Thanks, I'd rather ... I don't want ... I came...."

"You're looking rather rotten. I really think you'd better sit down, and
have a spot of something."

Tallboy's legs seemed to give way under him, and he sat down without
further protest.

==> "And how," inquired Wimsey, pouring him out a stiff whisky, "is the <==
Whifflets campaign getting on without me?"

"Whifflets?"

"It doesn't matter. I only asked to show you that I really was Bredon.

Tallboy had gone very white. He accepted another drink without protest,
and then said:

"Well, I'm rather glad in a way. If it wasn't for my wife and the

the window and glanced at the lights of Piccadilly, pale in the summer
dusk. "I've been a bloody fool," said Tallboy.

"Most of us are," said Wimsey. "I'm damned sorry, old chap."

well paid for it. Of course, I made a fuss about breach of confidence
and so on and he raised his terms to twelve hundred. It sounded damned
tempting, and I couldn't see, for the life of me, how it was going to
harm the firm in any way. So I said I'd do it, and we fixed up a code--"

==> "I know all about that," said Wimsey. "It was very ingenious and simple. <==
I suppose he told you that the address was simply an accommodation
address."

"Yes. Wasn't it? I went to see the place once; it was a tobacconist's."

address, in the sense you mean. Didn't this man give you any reason for
this rather remarkable request?"

"Yes, he did, and of course I oughtn't to have had anything to do with
him after that. He said he was fond of having a bit of a bet with some

was heavily in debt, and I used it. After that--well, I hadn't the
courage to chuck it."

"No, it would be rather hard, I should think."

==> "Hard? You don't know, Bredon--Wimsey--you don't know what it means to <==
be stuck for money. They don't pay any too well at Pym's, and there are
heaps of fellows who want to get out and find something better, but they
daren't. Pym's is safe--they're kind and decent, and they don't sack you
if they can help it--but you live up to your income and you simply
daren't cut loose. The competition is so keen, and you marry and start

Of course, I kept hoping that I might be able to save money and get out
of it, but my wife fell ill and one thing and another, and I was
spending every penny of my salary and Smith's money on top of it. And
then, somehow, that little devil Dean got hold of it; God knows how!"

==> "I can tell you that," said Wimsey, and told him. <==

"I see. Well, he started to put the screw on. First of all he wanted to
go fifty-fifty, and then he demanded more. The devil of it was, that if
he split on me, I should lose my job as well as Smith's money, and
things were getting pretty awful. My wife was going to have a baby, and

was chucking the whole show and he could do as he damn well pleased. And
it wasn't till then that he told me what it was all about, and pointed
out that I might easily get twelve years' penal servitude for helping to
run the dope-traffic."

==> "Dirty," said Wimsey, "very dirty. It never occurred to you, I suppose, <==
to turn King's Evidence and expose the whole system."

"No; not at first. I was terrified and couldn't think properly. And even
if I'd done that, there'd have been awful trouble. Still, I did think of
it after a bit, and told Dean that that was what I would do. And then he

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 91460    window = 91455 91465


Tallboy nodded.

"Well, you've had your experience. I hope you haven't paid as heavily
for it as I have. I could see no way out of it--"

==> He stopped speaking, and glanced at Wimsey. <==

"Perhaps I'd better tell you the next bit," said the latter. "You
thought it over, and decided that Victor Dean was a wart and a scab, and
would be no great loss to the world. One day, Wedderburn came along to
your room, chuckling because Mrs. Johnson had caught Ginger Joe with a

fuss was over, and then came down quietly by the stairs. I didn't meet a
soul, of course, they were all holding post-mortems and hanging round
the corpse. When I knew I'd succeeded, I didn't care. I was glad. And I
tell you this, if I hadn't been found out, I shouldn't care now."

==> "I can sympathize with that," said Wimsey. <==

"They asked me for a shilling for the little beast's wreath." Tallboy
laughed. "I'd gladly have given twenty shillings, or twenty pounds
even.... And then you came along.... I didn't suspect anything ... till
you started to talk about catapults.... And then I got badly frightened,

when you struck a light to look for Pamela Dean's letter."

"Yes. I knew her writing--I'd seen it in Dean's room--and I knew her
writing-paper, too. I really came round to find out whether you knew

"No; and the catapult. You should have taken the trouble to make your
own. A catapult without finger-prints is something very unusual."

"So that was it. I'm afraid I've made an awful mess of everything.

"Not about the Nutrax business. But she knew about Dean."

Heaven's name did _she_ know?"

"Guessed. Said she'd once seen me look at Dean when I didn't know she

Tallboy stared at him; the blood drained away from his face, leaving
even his lips as white as paper.

"I think I understand.... Very well."

"Good-night, and good luck."

"Thank you. Good-night."

"Good-night, and good luck."

"Thank you. Good-night."

==> From the window, Wimsey watched him come out into Piccadilly, and walk <==
quickly away towards Hyde Park Corner. He saw the shadow slip from a
neighbouring doorway and follow him.

"--and from thence to the place of execution ... and may the Lord have
mercy upon your soul."

The whole thing is most satisfactory. Now we have only got to rake in
your murderer chap, what's his name, and everything in the garden will
be lovely."

==> "Lovely," said Wimsey, with a spice of bitterness in his tone, "simply <==
lovely."

"What's the matter? You sound a bit peeved. Hang on a minute till I've
cleared up here and we'll go round somewhere and celebrate."

                   DEATH DEPARTS FROM PYM'S PUBLICITY

==> "So you see," said Wimsey to Mr. Pym, "the thing need never come into <==
the papers at all, if we're careful. We've plenty of evidence against
Cummings without that, and there's no need to take the public into our
confidence about the details of their distributing system."

"Thank Heaven!" said Mr. Pym. "It would have been a terrible thing for

"_No!_"

"What!!!"

Lord Peter poked his long nose round the door.

Lord Peter poked his long nose round the door.

"Quite right."

"Then what were you doing here?"

"I'd better make it half a quid too."

"Oh, no," said Miss Rossiter. "You're a lamb, but it isn't fair."

==> "It's quite fair," said Wimsey. "There are excellent reasons why I <==
should contribute largely to a wedding present for Mr. Willis."

"Are there? I thought you and he didn't get on very well. I expect I'm
being tactless, as usual. If you're quite sure--oh, I forgot, I _am_ a

He had a word with Miss Meteyard.

"A very sad business. Mr. Pym is very grateful for the discretion you
have shown. I hope you will lunch with me some day. Yes, Mr. Smayle?"

"Excuse me, sir--about this window-bill for Green Pastures?"

==> Wimsey made his way out, exchanging mechanical hand-grips and farewells. <==
At the foot of the lift, in the lower vestibule, he found Ginger, with
his arms full of parcels.

"Well, Ginger," said Wimsey, "I'm off."

==> "So it is." Wimsey sympathized with the temptation. It is not every <==
fellow whose catapult has been borrowed for the purpose of committing a
murder. "Well, I'll keep it, and thank you very much for all your help.
Look here, I'll tell you what. I'll give you something in exchange.

"Right you are; good-bye, Ginger."

"Good-bye, sir."

hoardings. Enormous in its midst stretched a kaleidoscopic poster:

                 SURPRISING METAMORPHOSIS OF MR. BREDON

==> Lord Peter Wimsey had paid a call upon Chief-Inspector Parker of <==
Scotland Yard, who was his brother-in-law.

He occupied a large and comfortable arm-chair in the Chief-Inspector's
Bloomsbury flat. Opposite him, curled upon the chesterfield, was his

Bloomsbury flat. Opposite him, curled upon the chesterfield, was his

the window-seat, hugging his knees and smoking a pipe, was Mr. Parker
himself. On a convenient table stood a couple of decanters and a soda

"So you have become one of the world's workers, Peter," said Lady Mary.

Lady Mary smiled, and glanced at her husband, who grinned cheerfully
back. The difficulties which are apt to arise when a poor man marries a
rich wife had, in their case, been amicably settled by an ingenious
arrangement, under which all Lady Mary's money had been handed over to
==> her brothers in trust for little Parkers to come, the trustee having the <==
further duty of doling out each quarter to the wife a sum precisely
equal to the earnings of the husband during that period. Thus a seemly
balance was maintained between the two principals; and the trifling
anomaly that Chief-Inspector Parker was actually a mere pauper in
comparison with small Charles Peter and still smaller Mary Lucasta, now

peacefully asleep in their cots on the floor above, disturbed nobody one
whit. It pleased Mary to have the management of their moderate combined
income, and incidentally did her a great deal of good. She now
patronized her wealthy brother with all the superiority which the worker

whit. It pleased Mary to have the management of their moderate combined
income, and incidentally did her a great deal of good. She now
patronized her wealthy brother with all the superiority which the worker
feels over the man who merely possesses money.

==> "But what _is_ the case all about, exactly?" demanded Parker. <==

"Blest if I know," admitted Wimsey, frankly. "I got hauled into it
through Freddy Arbuthnot's wife--Rachel Levly that was, you know. She
knows old Pym, and he met her at dinner somewhere and told her about
this letter that was worrying him, and she said, Why not get somebody in

this letter that was worrying him, and she said, Why not get somebody in
to investigate it, and he said, Who? So she said she knew somebody--not
mentioning my name, you see--and he said would she ask me to buzz along,
so I buzzed and there I am."

==> "Your narrative style," said Parker, "though racy, is a little <==
elliptical. Could you not begin at the beginning and go on until you
come to the end, and then, if you are able to, stop?"

"I'll try," said his lordship, "but I always find the stopping part of
the business so difficult. Well, look! On a Monday afternoon--the 25th

upper part of Southampton Row, and died immediately of injuries
received, to wit: one broken neck, one cracked skull, one broken leg and
minor cuts and contusions, various. The time of this disaster was, as
nearly as can be ascertained, 3.30 in the afternoon."

==> "Hum!" said Parker. "Pretty extensive injuries for a fall of that kind." <==

"So I thought, before I saw the staircase. To proceed. On the day after
this occurrence, the sister of deceased sends to Mr. Pym a fragment of a
half-finished letter which she has found on her brother's desk. It warns
him that there is something of a fishy nature going on in the office.

"All right. You always have an answer. Well now--do you clutch what
you're carrying with a deathly grip--or do you chuck it, and try to save
yourself by grabbing hold of the banisters?"

==> Mr. Parker paused. "I should probably grab," he said, slowly, "unless I <==
was carrying a tray full of crockery, or anything. And even then ... I
don't know. Perhaps it's an instinct to hold on to what one's got. But
equally it's an instinct to try and save one's self. I don't know. All
this arguing about what you and I would do and what the reasonable man
would do is very unsatisfactory."

hitting the banisters, he must have fallen first and hit himself
afterwards. The same thing applies, with still more force, to his
breaking his neck. Why, when he felt himself going, didn't he drop
everything and break his fall?"

==> "I know what you want me to say," said Parker. "That he was sandbagged <==
first and dead before he fell. But I don't see it. I say he would have
caught his toe in something and tripped forwards and struck his head
straight away and died of that. There's nothing impossible about it."

"Then I'll try again. How's this? That same evening, Mrs. Crump, the

"I think you were meant to think that. To continue: some few days
earlier, Mrs. Crump found a smooth pebble of much the same size as the
scarab lying in the same passage at the foot of the same iron
staircase."

==> "Did she?" said Parker. He uncurled himself from the window-seat and <==
made for the decanters. "What does she say about it?"

"Says that you'd scarcely believe the queer odds and ends she finds when
she's cleaning out the office. Attributes the stone to Mr. Atkins, he
having taken his seaside holiday early on account of ill-health."

not?"

"Why not, indeed? This other pebble, which I here produce, was found by
me on the roof of the lavatory. I had to shin down a pipe to get it, and
ruined a pair of flannel bags."

numbers of something, or if he isn't in any of those places, he's
somewhere else--slipping out for surreptitious coffee or haircuts. The
word alibi has no meaning in a place like Pym's."

"You're going to have a lovely time with it all, I can see that," said
==> Parker. "But what sort of irregularity could possibly be going on in a <==
place like that, which would lead to murder?"

"Now we're coming to it. Young Dean used to tag round with the de
Momerie crowd--"

place like that, which would lead to murder?"

"Now we're coming to it. Young Dean used to tag round with the de

"Sinning above his station in life?"

"Very much so. But you know Dian de Momerie. She gets more kick out of
corrupting the bourgeois--she enjoys the wrestle with their little

pushed her inside her dinky little maisonette in Garlic Mews and tucked
her up on a divan in the sitting-room to astonish her maid in the
morning. Though she's probably past being astonished. But, the point is
that I found out a good bit about Victor Dean."

==> "Just a moment," interrupted Parker, "did he dope?" <==

"Apparently not, though I'll swear it wasn't Dian's fault if he didn't.
According to his sister, he was too strong-minded. Possibly he tried it
once and felt so rotten that he didn't try it again.... Yes--I know what
you're thinking. If he was dopey, he might have fallen downstairs on his

"I suppose she realized that Dian was his mistress. Or wasn't she?"

"Must have been. But I rather gather his sister thought he was
contemplating matrimony."

==> Parker laughed. <==

"After all," said Lady Mary, "he probably didn't tell his sister
everything."

"Damned little, I should imagine. She was quite honestly upset by last

there's anything like that wrong with Pamela Dean. I'll swear her
disgust last night was genuine. It was pretty foul, I must say. By the
way, Charles, where the devil do these people get their stuff from?
There was enough dope floating about that house to poison a city."

==> "If I knew that," said Mr. Parker, sourly, "I should be on velvet. All I <==
can tell you is, that it's coming in by the boat-load from somewhere or
other, and is being distributed broadcast from somewhere or other. The
question is, where? Of course, we could lay hands tomorrow on half a
hundred of the small distributors, but where would be the good of that?
They don't know themselves where it comes from, or who handles it. They

can't blame them. Put it that he was spending far more than he could

he thought and that he had got heavily dipped. And then see what that
half-finished letter to Pym looks like in the light of that theory."

"Oh, do step on the gas!" broke in Mary. "How you two darlings do love
going round and round a subject, don't you? Blackmail, of course. It's
perfectly obvious. I've seen it coming for the last hour. This Dean

"Of course it's simple, only men love to make mysteries."

"And women love to jump to conclusions."

reasoning. Where do I come into all this?"

"You give me your advice, and stand by ready to rally round with your
myrmidons in case there's any rough-housing. By the way, I can give you

That notorious fellow Wimsey, of course. It's a mistake to be too well
known."

"If the de Momerie crowd get wise to you, you'll find yourself in Queer

"Dived off a fountain into a fish-pond. It pays to advertise. She thinks
I'm the world's eighth wonder. Absolutely the lobster's dress-shirt."

                ALARMING EXPERIENCE OF A CHIEF-INSPECTOR

On that same night, or rather in the early hours of the following
==> morning, a very disagreeable adventure befell Chief-Inspector Parker. He <==
was the more annoyed by it, in that he had done absolutely nothing to
deserve it.

He had had a long day at the Yard--no thrills, no interesting
disclosures, no exciting visitors, not so much as a dis-diamonded rajah

man, and a score or so of anonymous letters, all probably written by
lunatics. In addition, he had had to wait for a telephone call from an
inspector who had gone down to Essex to investigate some curious
movements of motor-boats in and about the estuary of the Blackwater. The
message, if favourable, might call for immediate action, on which
==> account Mr. Parker thought it better to wait for it in his office than <==
go home to bed, with the prospect of being hawked out again at 1 o'clock
in the morning. There, then, he sat, as good as gold, collating
information and drawing up a schedule of procedure for the following
day's activities, when the telephone duly rang. He glanced at the clock,
and saw that it pointed to 1.10. The message was brief and

information and drawing up a schedule of procedure for the following
day's activities, when the telephone duly rang. He glanced at the clock,
and saw that it pointed to 1.10. The message was brief and
unsatisfactory. There was nothing to report; the suspected boat had not
arrived with that tide; no action was therefore called for;
==> Chief-Inspector Parker could go home and get what sleep he could out of <==
the small hours.

Mr. Parker accepted disappointment as philosophically as the gentleman
in Browning's poem, who went to the trouble and expense of taking music
lessons just in case his lady-love might demand a song with lute

_obbligato_. Waste of time, as it turned out, but--suppose it hadn't
been. It was all in the day's work. Putting his papers tidily away and
locking his desk, the Chief-Inspector left the building, walked down to

the first-floor tenants in case of fire, he was not permitted to shut
his two floors completely off by means of a door across the staircase.

The front hall, common to all the tenants, was in darkness when he got
in. He switched on the light and hunted in the little glass-fronted box
==> labelled "Flat 3--Parker" for letters. He found a bill and a circular <==
and deduced, quite correctly, that his wife had been at home all evening
and too tired or too slack to go down to fetch the 9.30 post. He was
turning to go upstairs, when he remembered that there might be a letter
for Wimsey, under the name of Bredon, in the box belonging to Flat 4. As
a rule, of course, this box was not used, but when Wimsey had begun his

"Bredon," for the better information of the postman.

There was one letter in the "Bredon" box--the kind that novelists used
to call a "dainty missive"; that is to say, the envelope was tinted
mauve, had a gilt deckle-edge and was addressed in a flourishing
==> feminine handwriting. Parker took it out, intending to enclose it with a <==
note which he was sending to Wimsey in the morning, pushed it into his
pocket and went on up to the first floor. Here he switched out the
hall-light which, like the staircase lights, was fitted with two-way
wiring, and proceeded to the second floor, containing Flat 3, which
comprised his living-room, dining-room and kitchen. Here he hesitated,

wiring, and proceeded to the second floor, containing Flat 3, which
comprised his living-room, dining-room and kitchen. Here he hesitated,
but, rather unfortunately for himself, decided that he did not really
want soup or sandwiches. He switched off the lower light behind him and
pressed down the switch that should have supplied light to the top
==> flight. Nothing happened. Parker growled but was not surprised. The <==
staircase lights were the affair of the landlord, who had a penurious
habit of putting in cheap bulbs and leaving them there till the filament
broke. By this means he alienated his tenants' affections, besides
wasting more in electricity than he saved in bulbs, but then he was that
kind of man. Parker knew the stairs as well as he knew the landlord's

wasting more in electricity than he saved in bulbs, but then he was that

habits; he went on up in the dark, not troubling to light a match.

Whether the little incident had, however, put his professional
subconsciousness on the alert, or whether some faint stir of breath or
movement gave him last-minute warning, he never afterwards knew. He had

bothered about me, but dashed to the window and tried to get a squint at
the bloke as he went down the street."

Lady Mary smiled indulgently at this absurd remark, and turned to her
brother.

brother.

"So that's all I can tell you about it, and he's uncommonly lucky to be
alive, and ought to be jolly well thankful instead of grumbling."

==> "You'd grumble all right," said Parker, "with a bust collar-bone and a <==
headache like nothing on earth and a feeling as though bulls of Bashan
had been trampling on your tummy."

"It beats me," said Wimsey, "the way these policemen give way over a
trifling accident. In the Sexton Blake book that my friend Ginger Joe

nearly twenty years--giving way to bad temper and bandages because some
three-by-four crook has slugged him one on his own comfortable
staircase."

==> Parker grinned ruefully. <==

"I'm trying to think who it could have been," he said. "It wasn't a
burglar or anybody like that--it was a deliberate attempt at murder. The
light-bulb had been put out of action beforehand and he had been hiding
for hours behind the coal-bunker. You can see the marks of his feet.

Mary sped away, and returned in a few minutes with the pencil and the
coat.

"I can't find any letter."

==> Parker took the coat and, with his available hand, searched all the <==
pockets carefully.

"That's funny," he said. "I know it was there. One of those fancy
long-shaped mauve envelopes with gilt edges, and a lady's fist, rather
sprawly."

top. Everything done by numbers, and kindness. And, as I say, if you buy
enough, they give you a pencil. If you mount up to five pounds' worth,
they give you a fountain pen."

==> "That's very helpful," said Parker, sarcastically. "It ought to be easy <==
to identify a criminal who has bought a pound's worth of goods at
Darling's within the last six months or so."

"Wait a bit; I said I had expert knowledge. This pencil--a natty
scarlet, as you observe, with gold lettering--didn't come from any of

"I do. This is the new pencil design, with an improved propelling
mechanism. The old ones only propelled; this repels also, with a handy
twist of the what-d'ye-call. Darling's obligingly presented us with half
a gross of them to try out."

==> Mr. Parker sat up so suddenly that he jarred his shoulder and his head, <==
and groaned dismally.

"I think it highly improbable," went on Lord Peter, lusciously, "that
you have a deadly enemy at the pencil manufacturer's or at Darling's
head office. It seems to me much more likely that the gentleman with the

"I think so," said Wimsey, with satisfaction, "I certainly do think so.
Particularly as the assailant seems to have walked off with my private
correspondence. I know who--or to be grammatical, whom--that letter was
from, by the way."

==> "Who?" demanded Parker, disregarding the grammatical nicety. <==

"Why, from Pamela Dean, to be sure. I recognize your description of the
envelope."

"Pamela Dean? The victim's sister?"

"Rather a wide limit."

"M'm, yes. I thought I might get some reaction. What a pity it reacted
on you and not on me."

==> "A very great pity," agreed Mr. Parker, with feeling. <==

"Still, it might have been worse. We've got three lines to go upon. The
people who heard about the catapult. The people who knew, or inquired
for, my address. And, of course, the bloke who's lost his pencil. But, I
say--" Wimsey broke off with a shout of laughter--"what a shock it must

there was one. Runs that place down by the river. Mixed up with that big

taken somewhere, but where we don't know, and distributed out again to

any sensitive person to suicide. It was heart-breaking work.

In the matter of his own address, Bredon did get one piece of
information. Mr. Willis had asked for it one day. Discreet questioning
fixed the date to within a day or so, one way or another, of

than this, Miss Beit (the telephonist, who also presided over the office
address-book) could not go. It was all rather unnerving as well as

blunt instruments and violence for the future; nevertheless, he

              SURPRISING ACQUISITION OF A JUNIOR REPORTER

Very early one morning, a junior reporter on the _Morning Star_, of no
importance to anybody except himself and his widowed mother, walked out
of that great newspaper's palatial new offices and into the affairs of
==> Chief-Inspector Parker. This nonentity's name was Hector Puncheon, and <==
he was in Fleet Street at that time because a fire had broken out the
previous night in a large City warehouse, destroying a great deal of
valuable property and involving the spectacular escapes of three night
watchmen and a cat from the roofs of the adjacent buildings. Hector
Puncheon, summoned to the scene for the excellent reason that he had

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 86353    window = 86348 86358


there had only recently been trouble about another case in which
information had been held up. Having, therefore, heard Hector Puncheon's
story and scolded him soundly for having waited so long before examining
the mysterious package, he telephoned to Scotland Yard.

==> Chief-Inspector Parker, with his arm in a sling and his nerves very much <==
on edge, received the information in his own home, just as he thought
his day's work was happily done with. He grumbled horribly; but there
had been a good deal of fuss made lately at the Yard about dope-gangs,
and things had been said which he resented. He irritably called a taxi
and trundled down to the _Morning Star_ offices, accompanied by a morose

getting sleepy and stupid after a broken night and a hard day's work. He
could not control his yawns, and the Chief-Inspector snapped at him. In
answer to questions he managed, however, to give a fairly complete
account of his movements during the night and early morning.

==> "Actually, then," said Parker, when the tale was finished, "you can't <==
say with any certainty when you received this packet?"

"No, I can't," said Hector, resentfully. He could not help feeling that
it was very clever of him to have received the packet at all, and that
everybody ought, somehow, to be grateful to him. Instead of which, they

some string, a thing for opening beer-bottles with patent caps, a
corkscrew for opening ordinary beer-bottles, a very dirty handkerchief
and some crumbs.

"If you could remember using any of those things during the night--"
==> suggested Parker. <==

"I must have used the handkerchief," said Hector, gazing at it in some
dismay. "I meant to take a clean one out this morning. I did, too. Where
is it? Oh, in my trousers-pocket. Here it is. But of course," he added,
helpfully, "this isn't the suit I wore last night. I had my old tweed

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 86401    window = 86396 86406


helpfully, "this isn't the suit I wore last night. I had my old tweed
jacket on then. I must have put the dirty handkerchief in this pocket
with the other things instead of into the clothes-basket. I know it's
the one I had at the fire. Look at the soot on it."

==> "Quite so," said Parker, "but can you remember when you used this <==
handkerchief last night? Surely, if you had felt in your pocket at any
time, you couldn't have failed to come on the packet if it was there."

"Oh, yes, I could," said Hector, brightly. "I shouldn't notice. I'm so
accustomed to having a lot of junk in my pocket. I can't help you there,

accustomed to having a lot of junk in my pocket. I can't help you there,
I'm afraid."

Another frightful yawn attacked him. He stifled it manfully, and it
forced itself painfully out at his nose, nearly breaking his ear-drums
==> on the way. Parker gazed crossly at his grimacing countenance. <==

"Do try to keep your mind on what I am asking you, Mr. Firkin," he said.
"If only--"

"Puncheon," said Hector, annoyed.

"Puncheon," said Hector, annoyed.

==> "Puncheon," said Parker, "I beg your pardon. Did you at any time, Mr. <==
Puncheon--?"

"I don't know," interrupted Hector. "I honestly don't know. It's no good
asking. I can't tell you. I would if I could, but I simply can't."

little elementary knowledge of human nature.

"I think," he said, "a small drink is indicated."

He fetched a bottle of Johnnie Walker and some glasses from a locker and
==> set them on the desk, together with a siphon. Parker thanked him and, <==
suddenly ashamed of himself and his bad temper, apologized.

"I'm sorry," he said. "I'm afraid I was a bit curt. I got my collar-bone
broken a little time ago and it still aches a bit and makes me
abominably peevish. Let's go about this business another way. Why do you

"Yes; unless it was in the crowd at the fire. Because in the other
places--I mean in this office and when I was interviewing people,
everybody knew me, or at least they knew what I was there for."

==> "That seems sound," agreed Parker. "How about this restaurant where you <==
had your sausages?"

"There's that, of course. But I can't recollect anybody coming near
enough to me to shove things in my pocket. And it couldn't have been
during the fire either, because I had my burberry on, buttoned up. But

"Had you ever been to the White Swan before?"

"Once, I think, ages ago. Certainly not often. And I think there's a new
landlord since then."

==> "Well, then," said Parker, "what is there about you, Mr. Puncheon, that <==
induces people to hand you out valuable cargoes of dope on sight and
without payment?"

"Goodness knows," said Hector.

The desk telephone buzzed furiously, and Mr. Hawkins, snatching the
receiver, plunged into a long conversation with some unknown person. The
two policemen with their witness retired into a distant corner and
carried on the inquiry in low tones.

==> "Either," said Parker, "you must be the dead spit of some habitual <==
dope-peddler, or you must have led them in some way to imagine that you
were the person they expected to see. What did you talk about?"

Hector Puncheon racked his brains.

"We were swapping stories about parrots," said Hector Puncheon. "No,
wait, we began about dogs. The little tout person said he'd had a dog
that couldn't abide goats and that led on to parrots and mice (I'd
forgotten the mice)--and doping parrots with coffee and cayenne."

==> "Doping?" said Parker, quickly. "Was that word used?" <==

"No, I don't know that it was. The parrot was frightened of mice, and
they had to cure it of shock by giving it coffee."

"Whose parrot?"

"Was the parcel produced?"

"No, he never had a parcel."

==> "All right," said Parker, after a little more of this unsatisfactory <==
conversation. "We'll go into the matter, Mr. Puncheon. We're very much
obliged to you and Mr.--er--Hawkins for having called our attention to
the matter. We will take charge of the packet, and if we want you again,
we'll let you know."

He rose to his feet. Mr. Hawkins shot across from his desk.

"Got all you want? You don't want this story to go in, I suppose?" he
added, wistfully.

==> "No; you mustn't say anything about it at present," said Parker, firmly. <==
"But we're very much indebted to you, and if anything comes of it, you
shall have the story first with all the details we can give you. I can't
say fairer than that."

He left the office with Sergeant Lumley, mournful and silent, at his

the Chief-Inspector. "I like to see duties undertaken in a pleasant

"I do my best," replied Sergeant Lumley, offended.

==> Chief-Inspector Parker went resolutely home to bed. <==

                               CHAPTER XV


                SUDDEN DECEASE OF A MAN IN DRESS CLOTHES

==> Chief-Inspector Parker continued to be disturbed in his mind. There had <==
been another fiasco in Essex. A private motor-boat, suspected of being
concerned in the drug-traffic, had been seized and searched without
result--except, of course, the undesired result of giving the alarm to
the parties concerned, if they were concerned. Further, a fast car,
which had attracted attention by its frequent midnight excursions from

[line number in individual story] matching line = 9856    window = 9851 9861

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 87746    window = 87741 87751


the parties concerned, if they were concerned. Further, a fast car,
which had attracted attention by its frequent midnight excursions from
the coast to the capital, had been laboriously tracked to its
destination, and proved to belong to a distinguished member of the
diplomatic corps, engaged on extremely incognito visits to a lady
==> established in a popular seaside resort. Mr. Parker, still incapacitated <==
from personal attendance upon midnight expeditions, was left with the
gloomy satisfaction of saying that everything always went wrong when he
wasn't there himself. He was also unreasonably annoyed with Wimsey, as
the original cause of his incapacity.


[line number in individual story] matching line = 9884    window = 9879 9889

to them. It was not, however, unusual for gentlemen in dress clothes to
drop in at the Swan by way of a good finish to a lively night--or for
gentlemen without dress clothes, either. Nothing threw any light on the
mystery of the packet of cocaine.

==> Parker was, however, roused to some enthusiasm by Wimsey's report of his <==
conversations with Milligan.

"What incredible luck you do have, Peter. People who, in the ordinary
way, would avoid you like the plague, gate-crash into your parties at
the psychological moment and offer you their noses to lead them by."

[line number in individual story] matching line = 9898    window = 9893 9903

myself and informing her that if she wanted to know the worst about me,
she had only to inquire at my brother's address. It's a curious thing,
but people _cannot_ resist anonymous letters. It's like free sample
offers. They appeal to all one's lower instincts."

==> "You are a devil," said Parker. "One of these days you'll get into <==
trouble. Suppose Milligan had recognized you."

"I prepared his mind to accept a striking resemblance."

"I wonder he didn't see through it. Family resemblances don't usually

[line number in individual story] matching line = 9961    window = 9956 9966

real success. He lives from hand to mouth, as you may say. I dare say I
could spot him without much difficulty--but that's not what you want, is
it? You'd rather have the Napoleon of the dope-traffic, wouldn't you? If
he exists, that is."

==> "Certainly I should," said Parker, emphatically. <==

"That's what I thought. What, if you come to think of it, is a trifle
like an odd murder or assault, compared with a method of dope-running
that baffles Scotland Yard? Nothing at all."


[line number in individual story] matching line = 9967    window = 9962 9972

"That's what I thought. What, if you come to think of it, is a trifle
like an odd murder or assault, compared with a method of dope-running
that baffles Scotland Yard? Nothing at all."

==> "It isn't, really," replied Parker, seriously. "Dope-runners are <==
murderers, fifty times over. They slay hundreds of people, soul and
body, besides indirectly causing all sorts of crimes among the victims.
Compared with that, slugging one inconsiderable pip-squeak over the head
is almost meritorious."

"How indeed? Hang the one and give the other a few weeks in jail--or, if
of good social position, bind him over or put him on remand for six
months under promise of good behaviour."

==> Parker made a wry mouth. <==

"I know, old man, I know. But where would be the good of hanging the
wretched victims or the smaller fry? There would always be others. We
want the top people. Take even this man, Milligan, who's a pest of the
first water--with no excuse for it, because he isn't an addict

[line number in individual story] matching line = 9996    window = 9991 10001

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 87886    window = 87881 87891


in, and what would anybody gain by that?"

"Exactly," said Wimsey. "And how much better off will you be, even if
you catch the man above Milligan? The same thing will apply."

==> Parker made a hopeless gesture. <==

"I don't know, Peter. It's no good worrying about it. My job is to catch
the heads of the gangs if I can, and, after that, as many as possible of
the little people. I can't overthrow cities and burn the population."


[line number in individual story] matching line = 10007    window = 10002 10012

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 87897    window = 87892 87902


"'Tis the Last Judgment's fire must cure this place," said Wimsey,
"calcine its clods and set its prisoners free. There are times, Charles,
when even the unimaginative decency of my brother and the malignant
virtue of his wife appear to me admirable. I could hardly say more."

==> "You have a certain decency of your own, Peter," replied Parker, "which <==
I like better, because it is not negative." Having given voice to this
atrocious outburst of sentiment, he became extremely red in the face,
and hastened to cover up his lapse from good taste. "But at the present
moment I must say you are not being very helpful. You have been
investigating a crime--if it is a crime--for some weeks now, and the

[line number in individual story] matching line = 10029    window = 10024 10034

bodily necessities and leaving them to their argument, took up the
receiver.

"It's from the Yard, darling. Something about that man Puncheon."

==> Parker took the instrument and plunged into an animated discussion, <==
which ended with his saying:

"Send Lumley and Eagles along at once, and tell Puncheon to keep in
touch with you. I'm coming."


[line number in individual story] matching line = 10038    window = 10033 10043

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 87928    window = 87923 87933


touch with you. I'm coming."

"What's up?" inquired Wimsey.

"Our little friend Puncheon has seen his bloke in dress clothes again,"
==> said Parker, cursing as he tried to get his coat over his damaged <==
shoulder. "Saw him hanging about the _Morning Star_ offices this
morning, buying an early paper or something. Been chasing him ever
since, apparently. Landed out at Finchley, of all places. Says he
couldn't get on to the 'phone before. I must push off. See you later.
Cheerio, Mary dear. Bung-ho, Peter."

[line number in individual story] matching line = 10093    window = 10088 10098

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 87983    window = 87978 87988


that makes the best of things. "'Ow about a nice pair o' kippers?"

"I don't mind if I do," said the sergeant, "if only we're allowed to eat
'em in peace. But you mark my words, 'e'll start ringin' up again afore
we 'as time to swallow a bite. Which reminds me. I better ring up the
==> Yard and stop me lord Parker from traipsin' up 'ere. 'E mustn't be put <==
about. Oh, no!"

P.C. Eagles ordered the kippers and a pot of tea. He used his jaws more
readily for eating than for talking. The sergeant got his call, and
returned, just as the eatables were placed on the table.

[line number in individual story] matching line = 10400    window = 10395 10405

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 88290    window = 88285 88295


Eagles was relieved to have the support of a colleague. He knew that he
ought to get in touch with Sergeant Lumley and with Scotland Yard. An
hour's energetic action on the part of all resulted in a happy reunion
at the nearest police-station, where, in fact, Lumley had already
arrived, after depositing the unconscious Mr. Puncheon in hospital.
==> Chief-Inspector Parker came hot-foot to Kensington, heard the statements <==
of Lumley and Eagles, reviewed the scene of the disaster and the remains
of the mysterious man in dress clothes, and was annoyed. When a man whom
you have been elaborately chasing all over London has the impudence to
be killed just as you are on the point of catching him, and turns out to
have no tailor's name on his clothes and nothing to identify him by;

[line number in individual story] matching line = 10412    window = 10407 10417

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 88302    window = 88297 88307


into pulp by an electric train, so that you cannot usefully circulate
his photograph for recognition, your satisfaction in feeling that there
is something wrong about him is cancelled by the thought of the weary
work that his identification is going to involve.

==> "There's nothing for it," said Chief-Inspector Parker, "but his <==
laundry-mark, I suppose. And, of course, his dentistry, if any."

Irritatingly enough, the deceased turned out to have an excellent set of
teeth and at least three laundry-marks. Nor were his shoes helpful,
being ready-made, though by an excellent and much-advertised firm. In

[line number in individual story] matching line = 10422    window = 10417 10427

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 88312    window = 88307 88317


being ready-made, though by an excellent and much-advertised firm. In
fact, the wretched man had gone to meet his Maker in Farley's Footwear,
thus upholding to the last the brave assertion that, however
distinguished the occasion, Farley's Footwear will carry you through.

==> In this extremity, Mr. Parker--perhaps stimulated by the thought of <==
Messrs. Farley's advertising--rang up Pym's Publicity and desired to
speak with Mr. Bredon.

That gentleman was closeted with Mr. Armstrong when the call came
through. Whifflets were causing trouble. The sales of Whifflets had been

[line number in individual story] matching line = 10485    window = 10480 10490

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 88375    window = 88370 88380


Even today, few fathers care about having private aeroplanes delivered
to their daughters in quiet suburban areas. What we want is a new
scheme, on similar lines but with more family appeal. But it must boost
Britain. We've got to have the patriotic note."

==> It was in that moment, and while Chief-Inspector Parker was arguing over <==
the line with the office telephonist, that Mr. Death Bredon conceived
that magnificent idea that everybody remembers and talks about
today--the scheme that achieved renown as "Whiffling Round Britain"--the
scheme that sent up the sales of Whifflets by five hundred per cent in
three months and brought so much prosperity to British Hotel-keepers and

[line number in individual story] matching line = 10538    window = 10533 10543

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 88428    window = 88423 88433


further on, this repellent sentence had recast itself as: "All you Want
by Whiffling," and on the threshold of his own room, the first practical
possibility of Whiffledom struck him like a sledge-hammer. Fired with
excitement, he hurled himself at his desk, snatched a scribbling-block,
and had written the word "WHIFFLE" in capitals an inch high, when Miss
==> Rossiter arrived with the message that Mr. Parker urgently requested Mr. <==
Bredon to ring him up on the Whitehall number. Lord Peter Wimsey was so
intimately in the skin of Mr. Death Bredon that he said: "Damn!" loudly
and heartily.

Nevertheless, he obeyed the call, presented himself with leave of

[line number in individual story] matching line = 10548    window = 10543 10553

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 88438    window = 88433 88443


Nevertheless, he obeyed the call, presented himself with leave of
absence on urgent private business, and went down to Scotland Yard,
where he surveyed the clothes and effects of the man in the dress suit.

"No doubt we shall end by having to circularize the laundries," said
==> Parker. "Perhaps a photograph in some of the London and provincial <==
papers would be as well. I loathe newspapers, but they do advertise
one's requirements, and some of these laundry-marks may come from
outside London...."

Wimsey looked at him.

[line number in individual story] matching line = 10576    window = 10571 10581

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 88466    window = 88461 88471


to each of these two establishments and ask for the customer with the
elongated head who has a fancy for this type of brim. Do not waste your
time on laundry-marks, which are, at best, tedious and, at worst,
deceptive."

==> "Thanks," said Parker. "I thought you might be able to put your finger <==
either on the hatter or the tailor."

The first hatter they visited proved to be the right man. He directed
their researches to the flat of a Mr. Horace Mountjoy, who lived in
Kensington. They armed themselves with a search-warrant and visited the

[line number in individual story] matching line = 10603    window = 10598 10608

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 88493    window = 88488 88498


Mr. Mountjoy's flat but himself, and the chambermaid who did the rooms.
The bed had not been slept in. That was nothing unusual with Mr.
Mountjoy. He was frequently out all night, though he generally returned
to breakfast at 9.30.

==> Parker displayed his official card, and they went upstairs to a flat on <==
the third floor. Withers was about to open the door with his pass-key,
which, as he explained, he was accustomed to use in the mornings, to
avoid disturbing the tenants, but Parker stopped him and produced the
two keys which had been taken from the corpse. One of them fitted the
lock and established, without much doubt, that they had come to the

[line number in individual story] matching line = 10606    window = 10601 10611

to breakfast at 9.30.

Everything in the flat was in perfect order. There was a desk in the

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 88506    window = 88501 88511


Everything in the flat was in perfect order. There was a desk in the
sitting-room, containing a few bills and some notepaper, but its drawers
were all unlocked and it appeared to hold no secrets. Nor was there
anything remarkable about the bedroom or the small dining-room. In the
bathroom was a little cupboard containing the usual toilet articles and
==> household medicines. Parker made a rapid inventory of these, pausing for <==
a few minutes over a packet labelled "Bicarbonate of Soda," but touch
and taste soon assured him that this contained exactly what it purported
to contain. The only thing that could be considered in the slightest
degree out of the ordinary in the whole establishment was the presence
(also in the bathroom cupboard) of several packets of cigarette papers.

[line number in individual story] matching line = 10628    window = 10623 10633

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 88518    window = 88513 88523


"Did Mr. Mountjoy roll his own cigarettes?"

"I never saw him do so," replied Withers. "He smoked Turkish Abdullas as
a rule."

==> Parker nodded and impounded the cigarette-papers. A further search <==
disclosed no loose tobacco. A number of boxes of cigars and cigarettes
were retrieved from the dining-room sideboard. They looked innocent and
a few, which Parker promptly slit open, proved to contain excellent
tobacco and nothing else. Parker shook his head.


[line number in individual story] matching line = 10631    window = 10626 10636

"Nothing," replied Withers, "except to bring the new telephone
directory." He indicated the two clean volumes which lay upon the
sitting-room desk.

==> "Oh!" said Parker. This did not sound promising. "Did he come into the <==
room?"

"No, sir. He knocked at the door when Mrs. Trabbs and I were both here.
Mrs. Trabbs was sweeping, sir, and I was brushing Mr. Mountjoy's lounge
suit. I took the books in, sir, and handed him out the old ones."

[line number in individual story] matching line = 10673    window = 10668 10678

Mrs. Trabbs, produced, said there had been nothing in the waste-paper
basket except a wine-merchant's circular. Mr. Mountjoy wrote very little
and did not receive many letters.

Satisfied that there had been no interference with the flat since the
==> occupant had left the night before, Parker turned his attention to the <==
wardrobe and chest of drawers, where he found various garments, all
properly marked with the names of the tailor or shirt-maker responsible
for them. He noticed that all were by first-class artists in their own
line. Another silk hat, similar to the one now resting at Scotland Yard,
but with sweat-band and crown undisfigured, was found in a hat-box;

[line number in individual story] matching line = 10725    window = 10720 10730

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 88615    window = 88610 88620


"Well, sir, as I say, he didn't wear it above once or twice a week, sir.
And Mr. Mountjoy didn't trouble about the fashion of his hats. There was
one particular shape he fancied, and he had all his hats specially made
to that pattern."

==> Parker nodded. He knew this already from the hatter and from Wimsey, but <==
it was well to check matters up. He reflected that he had never yet
caught Wimsey tripping in any fact pertaining to dress.

"Well," he said, "as you may have guessed, Withers, there will have to
be an inquiry about Mr. Mountjoy's death. You had better say as little

[line number in individual story] matching line = 10737    window = 10732 10742

flat, and I shall be leaving the police in charge here for a day or
two."

"Very good, sir."

==> Parker waited to ascertain the name and address of the proprietor of the <==
flats, and left Lumley to his investigations. From the proprietor he
gained very little information. Mr. Mountjoy, of no profession, had
taken the flat six years previously. He had paid his rent regularly.
There had been no complaints. Nothing was known of Mr. Mountjoy's
friends or relations. It was regrettable that so good a tenant should

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 88637    window = 88632 88642


friends or relations. It was regrettable that so good a tenant should
have come to so sudden and sad an end. It was much to be hoped that
nothing would transpire of a scandalous nature, as those flats had
always been extremely respectable.

==> Parker's next visit was to Mr. Mountjoy's bank. Here he encountered the <==
usual obstructive attitude, but eventually succeeded in getting access
to the books. There was a regular income of about a thousand a year
derived from sound investments. No irregularities. No mysterious
fluctuations. Parker came away with an uneasy impression that Mr. Hector
Puncheon had discovered a mare's nest.

"He specializes in nervous complaints."

"Exactly."

"That's what you think, is it?"

"See here," said Wimsey, "your grey matter isn't functioning as it
ought. Are you tired at the end of the day? Do you suffer from torpor

under a train without the smallest apparent provocation, it's because
somebody else is interested in getting the things hidden, too. And the
more risks somebody else takes in the process, the more certain it is
that the thing is worth hiding."

you're not the only one?"

"No, I shouldn't. You're holding something out on me. What is it? A

Milligan crowd and that Friday is their day for distributing dope? The
Milligans get it on Friday and give house-parties on Friday night and
Saturday, when it goes into the hands of the actual addicts. Dian de
Momerie told me so."

==> "I wonder," said Parker, "why they stick to one day? It must add to the <==
risk."

"It's obviously an integral part of the system. The stuff comes into the
country--say on Thursdays. That's your part of the story. You don't seem
to have done much about that, by the way. It is taken to--somewhere or

"Perhaps Garfield meant to go there afterwards, if he hadn't got knocked
out."

"No; he'd not leave it so late. Tell me again about the flat."

==> Parker patiently repeated the account of his visit and the interviews <==
with the servants. Before he was half-way through, Wimsey had sat up in
his chair and was listening with fascinated attention.

"Charles! What imbeciles we are! Of course, that's it!"

"The Telephone Directory, of course. The man who brought the new volumes
and took the old away. Since when has the Post Office taken to getting
_both_ new volumes out at once?"

==> "By Jove!" exclaimed Parker. <==

"I should think it was, by Jove. Ring up now and find out whether two
new volumes were sent round to Mountjoy's address today."

"It'll be a job to get hold of O. C. Directories at this time of night."

[line number in individual story] matching line = 10957    window = 10952 10962

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 88847    window = 88842 88852


"So it will. Wait a moment. Ring up the flats and ask if anybody else
received any Directories this morning. My experience is that even
Government departments do these things in batches, and don't make a
special journey to every subscriber."

==> Parker acted on this suggestion. After a little trouble, he succeeded in <==
getting into touch with three other occupants in the same block as
Mountjoy's flat. All three gave the same answer. They had received a new
L-Z volume about a fortnight previously. The new A-K volume was not yet
due to be issued. One man went further. His name was Barrington, and he
had only recently moved in. He had inquired when the new A-K volume

revealed that the old directories had already been dispatched by the
sackful to the pulping-mills, but had not, so far, been pulped. Six
workers, toiling over the week-end among L-Z volumes collected from the
Kensington District, brought to light the pleasing fact that nine people
out of ten marked their directories in some way or another. Reports came
==> pouring in. Wimsey sat with Parker in the latter's office at Scotland <==
Yard and considered these reports.

Late on Sunday night, Wimsey raised his head from a sheaf of papers.

Late on Sunday night, Wimsey raised his head from a sheaf of papers.

"I think this is it, Charles."

==> "What is it?" Parker was weary and his eyes blood-shot with strain, but <==
a note of hope was in his voice.

"This one. A whole list of public-houses in Central London have been
ticked off--three in the middle of the L's, two near the end of the M's,
one in the N's, one in the O's, and so forth and so on, including two in

hundreds of W's. Still, we'll try it, Peter, any way. What is it,
Lumley?"

"Report from the hospital, sir. Puncheon has come round."

==> Parker glanced through the report. <==

"Much what we expected," he said, handing the paper to Wimsey. "Mountjoy
evidently knew he was being followed. He put through a telephone call at
Piccadilly Tube Station, and started off on a wild scamper across
London."

Pinching the cash, perhaps. She dialled the switchboard and asked for
Whitehall 1212.

"Just one moment," said Wimsey, when the door had closed upon her. "If
you really want Scotland Yard, tell her to ask for Chief-Inspector

he'll know what it's about."

"You are--? Why didn't you tell me?"

Mr. Pym put his head into Miss Hartley's room.

"I'll take that call in here," he said, briefly.

They sat mute till the call came through. Mr. Pym asked for

"There is a man here on my staff, calling himself--"

The conversation was a brief one. Mr. Pym handed the receiver to Wimsey.

home to his own flat in a taxi ("not the first nor the second that

Moriarty), barricade himself in and wait--for what? For air-guns?... In
this perplexity he suddenly caught sight of a familiar

home, and carrying a fishmonger's bag in one hand and an attaché case in
the other.

He lowered the paper and said, "Hullo!"

Death Bredon. Wimsey strode forward and relieved him of the fish-bag.

"Well met. You come most carefully upon your cue, to prevent me from

"I'm coming to eat it with you. They will hardly attack both of us. I've
made a fool of myself and given the game away, so we may as well be open
and cheerful about it."

anything about him. But you say he knew Milligan's name?"

"He certainly did. Besides, here's the proof of it."

He showed Parker the stop-press item.

"Everything I say is useful and important. Think it over while I go and

she wants servants, she'll ask for them."

you'll be wanting a resident nurse yourself, if you want to avoid nasty

"Office charabanc."

"Good. I'll see you round to the starting-point."

Wimsey nodded. Nothing further was said about dope or danger until
==> supper was over and Parker had departed for the Yelverton Arms. Then <==
Wimsey gathered up a calendar, the telephone directory, a copy of the
official report on the volume retrieved from Mountjoy's flat, a
scribbling-block and a pencil, and curled himself up on the couch with a
pipe.

of the thing is that the stuff is never distributed twice from the same

"It's entirely my fault," said Wimsey, blithely. "I sent you to the
