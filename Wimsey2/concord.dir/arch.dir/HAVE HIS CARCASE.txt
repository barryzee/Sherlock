The best remedy for a bruised heart is not, as so many people seem to
think, repose upon a manly bosom. Much more efficacious are honest work,
physical activity, and the sudden acquisition of wealth. After being
acquitted of murdering her lover, and, indeed, in consequence of that
acquittal, Harriet Vane found all three specifics abundantly at her
==> disposal; and although Lord Peter Wimsey, with a touching faith in <==
tradition, persisted day in and day out in presenting the bosom for her
approval, she showed no inclination to recline upon it.

Work she had in abundance. To be tried for murder is a fairly good
advertisement for a writer of detective fiction. Harriet Vane thrillers

than she had ever dreamed of becoming. In the interval between finishing
_Murder by Degrees_ and embarking on _The Fountain-Pen Mystery_, she had
started off on a solitary walking-tour: plenty of exercise, no
responsibilities and no letters forwarded. The time was June, the
weather, perfect; and if she now and again gave a thought to Lord Peter
==> Wimsey diligently ringing up an empty flat, it did not trouble her, or <==
cause her to alter her steady course along the south-west coast of
England.

On the morning of the 18th June, she set out from Lesston Hoe with the
intention of walking along the coast to Wilvercombe, sixteen miles away.

"A dead body," said Harriet, aloud to the sun and the seagulls. "A dead
body. How--how appropriate!" She laughed.

"The great thing," Harriet found herself saying, after a pause, "the
great thing is to keep cool. Keep your head, my girl. What would Lord
==> Peter Wimsey do in such a case? Or, of course, Robert Templeton?" <==

Robert Templeton was the hero who diligently detected between the covers
of her own books. She dismissed the image of Lord Peter Wimsey from her
mind, and concentrated on that of Robert Templeton. The latter was a
gentleman of extraordinary scientific skill, combined with almost

Peter Wimsey do in such a case? Or, of course, Robert Templeton?"

Robert Templeton was the hero who diligently detected between the covers

mind, and concentrated on that of Robert Templeton. The latter was a
gentleman of extraordinary scientific skill, combined with almost
fabulous muscular development. He had arms like an orang-outang and an
ugly but attractive face. She conjured up this phantom before her in the
suit of rather loud plus-fours with which she was accustomed to invest

dusty half-mile without further encounter.

It was odd, she thought. During the morning she had seen several people
and quite a number (comparatively) of tradesmen's vans. What had
happened to them all? Robert Templeton (or possibly even Lord Peter
==> Wimsey, who had been brought up in the country) would have promptly <==
enough found the answer to the riddle. It was market-day at Heathbury,
and early-closing day at Wilvercombe and Lesston Hoe--the two phenomena
being, indeed, interrelated so as to permit the inhabitants of the two
watering-places to attend the important function at the market-town.
Therefore there were no more tradesmen's deliveries along the

tried for poisoning Philip Boyes two years ago."

"Ah, just so!" replied the Inspector. "Yes. They got the fellow who did
it, too, didn't they? Arsenic case. Yes, of course. There was some very
pretty medical evidence at the trial, if I remember rightly. Smart piece
==> of work. Lord Peter Wimsey had something to do with it, didn't he?" <==

"Quite a lot," said Harriet.

"He seems to be a clever gentleman," observed the Inspector. "One's
always hearing of him doing something or other."

"You'll know him very well, I expect?" pursued the Inspector, filled
with what Harriet felt to be unnecessary curiosity.

"Oh, yes, quite well. Yes, of course." It struck her that this sounded
==> ungracious, seeing that Wimsey had undoubtedly saved her from a very <==
disagreeable position, if not from an ignominious death, and she went
on, hastily and stiltedly, "I have a great deal to thank him for."

"Naturally," replied the Inspector. "Not but what" (loyally) "Scotland
Yard would probably have got the right man in the end. Still" (here

She grinned a friendly grin at him.

"Yes, miss," said Inspector Umpelty, grinning also. He had his private
cause for amusement. If Harriet's note-case had ensured her reception at
the Resplendent, it was his own private whisper of "friend of Lord Peter
==> Wimsey" that had produced the view over the sea, the bath and the <==
balcony. It was just as well that Harriet did not know this. It would
have annoyed her.

Curiously enough, however, the image of Lord Peter kept intruding upon
her mind while she was telephoning her address to the _Morning Star_,

"I rang them up myself," replied Harriet. "First-class publicity, you
know, and all that."

==> "So it is," agreed Wimsey, helping himself lavishly to butter. "Rang 'em <==
up, did you, with all the gory details?"

"Naturally; that was the first thing I thought of."

"You're a woman of business. But does it not, pardon me, indicate a

to man, have let me in on the ground-floor?"

"If you put it that way," admitted Harriet, rather ashamed of herself,
"I certainly might. But I thought----"

==> "Women _will_ let the personal element crop in," said Wimsey, acutely. <==
"Well, all I can say is, you owe it to me to make up for it now. _All_
the details, please."

"I'm tired of giving details," grumbled Harriet, perversely.

She pushed her plate aside and took up a clean knife.

"This," she said, "is the coast-road from Lesston Hoe to Wilvercombe.
The shore bends about like this----" She took up the pepper-pot.

==> "Try salt," suggested Wimsey. "Less irritatin' to the nasal tissues." <==

"Thank you. This line of salt is the beach. And this piece of bread is a
rock at low-water level."

Wimsey twitched his chair closer to the table.

"And this salt-spoon," he said, with childlike enjoyment, "can be the

He made no comment while Harriet told her story, only interrupting once

from either direction, if he did it that way. If he came from Lesston
Hoe he must have arrived after me, because I could see the shore as I
walked along, and there was no one walking there then. But he could have
come at any time from the Wilvercombe side."

==> "No, he couldn't," said Wimsey. "He wasn't there, you said, at one <==
o'clock."

"He might have been standing on the seaward side of the Flat-Iron."

"So he might. Now, how about the corpse? We can tell pretty closely when

"Why not? Much tidier than doing it in your bedroom or anywhere like
that. Aren't we beginning at the wrong end? If we knew who the man was,
we might find he had left an explanatory note behind him to say why he
was going to do it. I daresay the police know all about it by now."

==> "Possibly," said Wimsey in a dissatisfied tone. <==

"What's worrying you?"

"Two things. The gloves. Why should anybody cut his throat in gloves?"

He greeted Harriet pleasantly.

"I thought you might like to see how your snaps have turned out, Miss
Vane. And we've identified the man."

==> "No? Have you? Good work. This is Inspector Umpelty--Lord Peter Wimsey." <==

The Inspector appeared gratified by the introduction.

"You're early on the job, my lord. But I don't know that you'll find
anything very mysterious about this case. Just a plain suicide, I

"You're early on the job, my lord. But I don't know that you'll find
anything very mysterious about this case. Just a plain suicide, I
fancy."

==> "We had regretfully come to that conclusion," admitted Wimsey. <==

"Though why he should have done it, I don't know. But you never can tell
with these foreigners, can you?"

"I thought he looked rather foreign," said Harriet.

"We've found nothing so far. And as regards the coroner, that's a bit of
a bother, that is. I don't know how long it'll be, miss, before you're
wanted. You see, we can't find the body."

==> "You don't mean to tell me," said Wimsey, "that the evil-eyed doctor and <==
the mysterious Chinaman have already conveyed it to the lone house on
the moor?"

"You will have your fun, my lord, I see. No--it's a bit simpler than
that. You see, the current sets northwards round the bay there, and with

is, we'll have to wait till the wind goes down. You can't take a boat in
there with this sea running, and you can't dive off the rocks--even
supposing you knew whereabouts to dive. It's a nuisance, but it can't be
helped."

==> "H'm," said Wimsey. "Just as well you took those photographs, Sherlock, <==
or we'd have no proof that there ever had been a body."

"Coroner can't sit on a photograph, though," said the Inspector,
gloomily. "Howsomever, it looks like a plain suicide, so it doesn't
matter such a lot. Still, it's annoying. We like to get these things

"Coroner can't sit on a photograph, though," said the Inspector,
gloomily. "Howsomever, it looks like a plain suicide, so it doesn't

tidied up as we go along."

==> "Naturally," said Wimsey. "Well, I'm sure if anybody can tidy up, you <==
can, Inspector. You impress me as being a man with an essentially tidy
mind. I will engage to prophesy, Sherlock, that before lunch-time
Inspector Umpelty will have sorted out the dead man's papers, got the
entire story from the hotel-manager, identified the place where the
razor was bought and explained the mysterious presence of the gloves."

"But the gloves?"

"Well, my lord, I expect the only person that could tell us about that
is the poor blighter himself, and he's dead. But as regards the papers,
you're dead right. I'm going along there now." He paused, doubtfully,

"No," said Wimsey. "Set your mind at rest. We are not going to ask to
come with you. I know that the amateur detective has a habit of
embarrassing the police in the execution of their duty. We are going out

"No flies on that young lady," he observed. "But can she be trusted to
hold her tongue?"

Harriet, escaping half an hour later from Salcombe Hardy and his

"I've got rid of the Inspector," observed that gentleman, cheerfully.
"Get your hat on and we'll go."

Their simultaneous exit from the Resplendent was observed and recorded

"Get your hat on and we'll go."

Their simultaneous exit from the Resplendent was observed and recorded
by the photographic contingent, who had just returned from the shore.
Between an avenue of clicking shutters, they descended the marble steps,
==> and climbed into Wimsey's Daimler. <==

"I feel," said Harriet, maliciously, "as if we had just been married at
St. George's, Hanover Square."

"No, you don't," retorted Wimsey. "If we had, you would be trembling

experience--you've no idea. We'll be all right at the police-station,
provided the Super doesn't turn sticky on us."

Superintendent Glaisher was conveniently engaged, and Sergeant Saunders

provided the Super doesn't turn sticky on us."

Superintendent Glaisher was conveniently engaged, and Sergeant Saunders
was deputed to show them the razor.

"Yes, my lord."

"Any result?"

"Any result?"

"I couldn't exactly say, my lord, but I believe not."

his fingers, inspecting it carefully, first with the naked eye and
secondly with a watchmaker's lens. Beyond a very slight crack on the
ivory handle, it showed no very striking peculiarities.

"You aren't suggesting," said Harriet, "that the weapon isn't really the

"Suspicious circumstance," said Harriet, shaking her head. "I've got
three handkerchiefs in my pack with not only the laundry-marks but the
initials of total strangers."

"Prime Ministers, especially Ruritanian ones, are notoriously careless
about their laundry. Now the shoe. Oh, yes. Nearly new. Thin sole. Foul
colour and worse shape. Hand-made, so that the horrid appearance is due
to malice aforethought. Not the shoe of a man who does much walking.
Made, I observe, in Wilvercombe."

"Thank you very much, my lord."

"I'm sorry," he then announced, as they threaded their way through the
side-streets, "to renounce our little programme of viewing the town. I

"Well, I think one may be reasonably certain about the beard."

looked at his watch.

take a seat in the lounge and order some refreshment. It is a little

"Well! Consider first of all the anomaly of the man who buys his razor
from Endicott's and yet wears the regrettable shoes and mass-production

question of expense, exactly. The shoes are hand-made--which merely
proves that a dancer has to take care of his feet. But _could_ a man who
is shaved by Endicott possibly order--deliberately _order_--shoes of
that colour and shape? A thing imagination boggles at."

"I'm afraid," admitted Harriet, "that I have never managed to learn all
the subtle rules and regulations about male clothing. That's why I made
Robert Templeton one of those untidy dressers."

"The one blot on your otherwise fascinating tales. But to leave that
distressing subject and come back to the razor. That razor has seen a
good deal of hard wear. It has been re-ground a considerable number of
times, as you can tell by the edge. Now, a really first-class razor like

Daimler's running-board.

"Port or sherry?" she demanded.

"The frock--port or sherry?"

"Claret," said Wimsey. "Château Margaux 1893 or thereabouts. I'm not
particular to a year or two."

"Oh, dear no, my lord. He keeps his health wonderfully. He has taken up
golf at seventy-six and collects papier-mâché articles. Nothing like an
interest in life, he says, to keep you hearty."

==> "Very true," replied Wimsey. "I must run out and see him some time. What <==
is his address?"

The manager gave the information, and then, returning to the matter in
hand, plunged the skewer into the ham close to the bone, twirled it
expertly and, withdrawing it, presented it politely by the handle.

pronounced a solemn benediction upon the ham.

"Thank you, my lord. I think you will find it very tasty. Shall I send
it?"

impressively in various layers of grease-proof paper, white paper and
brown paper, corded it up with best-quality string, worked the free end
of the string into an ingenious handle and stood, dandling the parcel,
like a nurse with a swaddled princeling.

==> "My car is outside," said Wimsey. The assistant beamed gratification. A <==
little ritual procession streamed out into Jermyn Street, comprising:
The Assistant, carrying the ham; Lord Peter, drawing on his
driving-gloves; the Manager, murmuring a ceremonial formula; the Second
Assistant, opening the door and emerging from behind it to bow upon the

Mr. Endicott, with a gracious smile upon his rosy countenance, poured
out another glass of the sherry and said he would be happy to assist if
he could.

==> Wimsey described the make and appearance of the razor, and asked if it <==
would be possible to trace the buyer.

"Ah!" said Mr. Endicott. "With an ivory handle, you say. Well, now, it's
rather fortunate it should be one of that lot, because we only had the
three dozen of them, most of our customers preferring black handles.

War either. He was always the same. I think he took the edge off with
the strop, instead of putting it on; I do indeed. He didn't keep a man,
you know. The Colonel belongs to one of our best families, but not a
wealthy man, by any means. A very fine soldier, I believe."

==> "One of the old school, eh?" said Wimsey. "Good-hearted but peppery. I <==
know. Where did you say he was living now?"

"Stamford," replied Mr. Endicott, promptly. "He sent me a card last
Christmas. Very kind of him, I thought it, to remember me. But my old

I may have been of some assistance to you. You keep very fit, I hope.
You're looking well."

"I'm getting old," said Lord Peter. "My hair is turning grey over the
temples."

weakening or falling-off, let me know. I should be proud to advise you.
I've still got the recipe for Endicott's Special Tonic, and though I
say so myself, I've never found anything to beat it."

==> Wimsey laughed, and promised to call on Mr. Endicott for help at the <==
first symptom of trouble. The old barber saw him to the door, clasping
his hand affectionately and begging him to come again. Mrs. Endicott
would be so sorry to have missed him.

Seated behind the steering-wheel, Wimsey debated the three courses open

SATURDAY, 20 JUNE
SUNDAY, 21 JUNE

==> Wimsey, sleek with breakfast, sunshine and sentiment, strolled <==
peacefully upon the close-clipped lawn of the George at Stamford,
pausing now and again to inhale the scent of a crimson rose, or to
marvel at the age and extent of the wistaria, trailing its lacy tendrils
along the grey stone wall. He had covenanted with himself to interview
Colonel Belfridge at eleven o'clock. By that time, both of them would

a moment of more than ordinary inspiration, was extremely indignant. It
seemed to him that it was an ungentlemanly action to go and interrogate
a man's barber, hr'rm, about a man's personal belongings, and he
resented the insinuation that a man could possibly be mixed up, hr'rm,
in the decease of a damned dago, hr'rm, in an adjectival four-by-three

The Colonel intimated that golf, or, hr'rm, breeding spaniels would be a

The Colonel pounced on this remark immediately, turned Wimsey's
war-record inside out, discovered a number of military experiences
common to both of them, and presently found himself walking with his

common to both of them, and presently found himself walking with his
visitor down the pansy-edged path of his little garden to display a
litter of puppies.

A middle-aged woman appeared in the back doorway and waddled hastily
down the path towards them.

"Gentleman for lunch!" bawled the Colonel. "And decant a bottle of the

razors. Once his attention was captured, however, Colonel Belfridge

He remembered the pair of razors perfectly. Had a lot of trouble with

young days. Nothing was, sir, dammit! Steel wouldn't stand up to the
work. What with these damned foreigners and mass-production, our
industries were going to the dogs. He remembered, during the Boer
War----

==> Wimsey, after a quarter of an hour, mentioned the subject of razors. <==

"Ha! yes," said the Colonel, smoothing his vast white moustache down and
up at the ends with a vast, curving gesture. "Ha, hr'rm, yes! The
razors, of course. Now, what do you want to know about them?"

and steel industry. But will they do it? No, damme, sir--they're afraid
of losing their miserable votes. Flapper votes! How can you expect a
pack of women to understand the importance of iron and steel? Tell me
that, ha, hr'rm!"

==> Wimsey asked what he had done with the razors. <==

"Gave 'em to the gardener," said the Colonel. "Very decent man. Comes in
twice a week. Wife and family. War pensioner with a game leg. Helps with
the dogs. Quite a good man. Name of Summers."

that time, poor bitch. She died two years ago--killed--run over by a
damned motor-cyclist. Best bitch I ever had. I had him up in court for
it--made him pay. Careless young devil. No consideration for anybody.
And now they've abolished the speed-limit----"

==> Wimsey reminded the Colonel that they were talking about razors. <==

After further consideration, the Colonel narrowed down the period to
the year 1926. He was sure about it, because of the spaniel's illness,
which had given Summers considerable trouble. He had made the man a
present of money, and had added the razors, having just purchased a new

pair for himself. Owing to the illness of the mother, only one puppy out
of the litter had been successfully reared, and that was Stamford Royal,
who had proved a very good dog. A reference to the stud-book clinched
the date conclusively.

==> Wimsey thanked the Colonel, and asked whether he could interview <==
Summers.

By all means. It was not one of Summers' days, but he lived in a little
cottage near the bridge. Wimsey could go and see him and mention the
Colonel's name. Should the Colonel walk down with Wimsey?

not make use of them, preferring the safety instrument, but of course he
had not told the Colonel that, not wishing to hurt his feelings. He had
given the razors to his sister's husband, who kept a hairdressing
establishment in Seahampton.

==> Seahampton! Less than 50 miles from Wilvercombe! Had Wimsey struck it <==
lucky with his very first shot? He was turning away, when it occurred to
him to ask whether there was any special mark by which either of the
razors might be recognized.

Yes, there was. One of them had been accidentally dropped on the stone

[line number in individual story] matching line = 3462    window = 3457 3467

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 64358    window = 64353 64363


Yes, there was. One of them had been accidentally dropped on the stone
floor of the cottage and there was a slight, a very slight crack across
the ivory. You wouldn't hardly notice it without you looked closely. The
other razor was, so far as Summers knew, quite perfect.

==> Wimsey thanked his informant and rewarded him suitably. He returned to <==
the car and set his course southward. He had always thought Stamford a
beautiful town and now, with its grey stone houses and oriel windows
bathed in the mellow afternoon sunshine, it seemed to him the loveliest
jewel in the English crown.

He slept that night in Seahampton, and on the Sunday morning set forth
in search of Summers' brother-in-law, whose name was Merryweather--a
name of happy omen. The shop turned out to be a small one, in the
neighbourhood of the docks. Mr. Merryweather lived above his premises,
==> and was delighted to give Wimsey information about the razors. <==

He had had them in 1927, and they were good razors, though they had been
badly treated and were considerably worn when they came into his hands.
He had one of them still, and it was doing good service. Perhaps his
lordship would like to look at it. Here it was.

==> Wimsey, with a beating heart, turned it over in his hands. It was the <==
exact duplicate of the razor that Harriet had found on the shore. He
examined it carefully, but found no crack in the ivory. But what, he
asked, almost afraid to put the question for fear of disappointment,
what had become of the fellow to it?

"That's right," said Henry. "Of course. Bright. What's the matter with
him? Been getting into trouble?"

==> "I shouldn't wonder if he had," said Wimsey. <==

"Police?" suggested Henry, with a sparkling countenance.

"Now, Henry," said Mr. Merryweather. "Does his lordship here look as if
he was the police? I'm surprised at you. You'll never make your way in

he was the police? I'm surprised at you. You'll never make your way in
this profession if you don't know better than that."

Henry blushed.

==> "I'm not the police," said Wimsey, "but I shouldn't be surprised if the <==
police did want to get hold of Mr. Bright one of these days. But don't
you say anything about that. Only, if you should happen to see Mr.
Bright again, at any time, you might let me know. I'm staying at
Wilvercombe at the moment--at the Bellevue--but in case I'm not there,
this address will always find me."

He thought for a moment, then went into a telephone call-box and rang up

Yes, by all means. The Seahampton police should be asked to trace

SUNDAY, 21 JUNE

==> Harriet Vane and Lord Peter Wimsey sat side by side on the beach, <==
looking out towards the Devil's Flat-Iron. The fresh salt wind blew
strongly in from the sea, ruffling Harriet's dark hair. The weather was
fine, but the sunshine came only in brilliant bursts, as the driven
clouds rolled tumultuously across the bellowing vault of the sky. Over
the Grinders, the sea broke in furious patches of white. It was about

clouds rolled tumultuously across the bellowing vault of the sky. Over
the Grinders, the sea broke in furious patches of white. It was about
three o'clock in the afternoon, and the tide was at its lowest, but even
so, the Flat-Iron was hardly uncovered, and the Atlantic waves, roaring
in, made a heavy breach against its foot. A basket of food lay between
==> the pair, not yet unpacked. Wimsey was drawing plans in the damp sand. <==

"The thing we want to get," he said, "is the time of the death. The
police are quite clear about how Alexis came here, and there doesn't
seem to be any doubt in the matter, which is a blessing. There's a train
from Wilvercombe that stops at Darley Halt on Thursdays at 10.15, to

"How about your murder-theory? That's done it in absolutely. If Alexis
was murdered at two o'clock, and I was there ten minutes after--_what
became of the murderer_?"

==> Wimsey sat up as suddenly as though he had been stung. <==

"Oh, _hell_!" he exclaimed. "Harriet; dear, sweet, beautiful Harriet,
say you were mistaken. We _can't_ be wrong about the murder. I've staked
my reputation with Inspector Umpelty that it couldn't have been suicide.
I shall have to leave the country. I shall never hold my head up again.

fully rigged four-masted schooner, but otherwise one sailing-boat was to
her exactly like any other; as it is to most town-bred persons,
especially to literary young women.

boats must come to shore somewhere, thank goodness. And they're all well
known to people along the coast. I only wanted to know what sort of

might have ducked down close under the rock and waited there till I came
down to look for the razor. Then he might have dived and swum away while
my back was turned. I don't know if it's possible, and I hope it isn't,
because I should hate to think he was there all the time--watching me!"

==> "It's a nasty thought," said Wimsey. "I rather hope he was there, <==
though. It would give him a beast of a shock to see you hopping round
taking photographs and things. I wonder if there is any cleft in the
Flat-Iron where he might have hidden himself. Curse the rock! Why can't
it come out and show itself like a man? I say, I'm going down to have a
look at it. Turn your modest eyes seawards till I have climbed into a

bathing-suit, and I'll go down and explore."

Not content with this programme, unsuited to a person of her active
temperament, Harriet removed, not only her glance, but her person, to
the shelter of a handy rock, and emerged, bathing-suited, in time to
==> catch Wimsey as he ran down over the sand. <==

"And he strips better than I should have expected," she admitted
candidly to herself. "Better shoulders than I realised, and, thank
Heaven, calves to his legs." Wimsey, who was rather proud of his figure,
would hardly have been flattered could he have heard this modified

the shelter of a handy rock, and emerged, bathing-suited, in time to
catch Wimsey as he ran down over the sand.

"And he strips better than I should have expected," she admitted
candidly to herself. "Better shoulders than I realised, and, thank
==> Heaven, calves to his legs." Wimsey, who was rather proud of his figure, <==
would hardly have been flattered could he have heard this modified
rapture, but for the moment he was happily unconcerned about himself. He
entered the sea near the Flat-Iron with caution, not knowing what bumps
and boulders he might encounter, swam a few strokes to encourage
himself, and then popped his head out to remark that the water was

himself, and then popped his head out to remark that the water was
beastly cold and that it would do Harriet good to come in.

Harriet came in, and agreed that the water was cold and the wind icy.
Agreed on this point, they returned to the Flat-Iron, and felt their way
==> carefully round it. Presently Wimsey, who had been doing some <==
under-water investigation on the Wilvercombe side of the rock, came out,
spluttering, and asked if Harriet had come down on that side or on the
other to hunt for the razor.

"On the other," said Harriet. "It was like this. I was up on top of the

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 64780    window = 64775 64785


rock with the body, like this." She climbed out, walked up to the top of
the rock, and stood shivering in the wind. "I looked round on both sides
of me like this."

"You didn't look down in this direction, by any chance?" inquired
==> Wimsey's head, standing up sleek as a seal's out of the water. <==

"No, I don't think so. Then, after I'd fussed about with the corpse a
bit, I got down this way. I sat on something just about here and took my
shoes and stockings off and tucked my things up. Then I came round in
this direction and groped about under the rock. There was about eighteen

bit, I got down this way. I sat on something just about here and took my
shoes and stockings off and tucked my things up. Then I came round in
this direction and groped about under the rock. There was about eighteen
inches of water then. There are about five feet now, I should think."

==> "Can you----?" began Wimsey. A wave slopped suddenly over his head and <==
extinguished him. Harriet laughed.

"Can you see me?" he went on, blowing the water out of his nostrils.

"I can't. But I heard you. It was very amusing."

[line number in individual story] matching line = 3910    window = 3905 3915

a pretty little roof and room to squeeze in rather tightly sideways, if
you're not what the Leopard called 'too vulgar big.' Come round and try
it for yourself."

"What a sweet little spot," said Harriet, scrambling round and taking
==> Wimsey's place in the niche. "Beautifully screened from all sides, <==
except from the sea. Even at quite low tide one couldn't be seen,
unless, of course, somebody happened to come round and stand just
opposite the opening. I certainly didn't do that. How horrible! The man
must have been in here all the time."

look queer. If it was Bright, he might just have hung round to get some
idea of what I was going to say to the police, and then removed himself
before the inquiry. Good lord! Fancy me, meekly trotting along for a
mile and a half hand in hand with a murderer!"

==> "Juicy," said Wimsey, "very juicy! We'll have to look more carefully <==
into Mr. Perkins. (Can that name be real? It seems almost too suitable.)
You know where he went?"

"No."

never meant to come back. You've only got to look at the place.
Everything tidied away, bills all paid up, papers burnt in the
grate--you might say he'd regular said good-bye and kissed his hand to
everything."

==> "Did he take his latch-key with him?" asked Wimsey. <==

"Yes, he did. But that's nothing. A man keeps his key in his pocket and
he mightn't think to put it out. But he left pretty well everything else
in order. You'd be surprised. Not so much as an envelope, there wasn't.
Must have had a regular old bonfire there. Not a photograph, not a line

"I couldn't say, I'm sure, miss. Maybe the other one turned him down as
well."

"And left him a low, lorn crittur, with all the world contrairy with
==> him," said Wimsey. <==

"Yes, and then there was this Mrs. Weldon. We found out about her
through these other girls. Wouldn't you say a prospect like that was
enough to make any young fellow cut his throat?"

"He could have gone away," said Harriet.

"And suppose he owed her money and she turned crusty and threatened to
put him in court? What about that?"

==> "Perhaps the three hundred pounds----" began Wimsey. <==

"Oh, no, _no_!" cried Harriet indignantly. "You mustn't think that. It's
absolutely ridiculous. Why, the poor woman was infatuated with him. He
could have turned her round his little finger. She'd have given him
anything he wanted. Besides, she told me he wouldn't take her money."

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 65254    window = 65249 65259


If this Mrs. Weldon----"

"Rubbish!" said Harriet. "She'd never have done anything of the sort. I
_know_ she wouldn't."

==> "Ah!" Inspector Umpelty winked in a friendly manner at Wimsey. "When the <==
ladies get to knowing things by this feminine intuition and all that,
there's no arguing with it. But what I say is, let's suppose it, just
for the moment."

"I won't suppose it," retorted Harriet.

[line number in individual story] matching line = 4365    window = 4360 4370

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 65261    window = 65256 65266


there's no arguing with it. But what I say is, let's suppose it, just
for the moment."

"I won't suppose it," retorted Harriet.

==> "We seem to have reached a no-thoroughfare," remarked Wimsey. "Let's <==
leave that for the time being, Inspector. You can come and suppose it in
the bar, quietly, later on. Though I don't think it very likely myself.
It's our turn to suppose something. Suppose a fishing-boat had wanted to
come in at the Flat-Iron just about low tide on Thursday--could she do
it?"

[line number in individual story] matching line = 4413    window = 4408 4418

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 65309    window = 65304 65314


with it, never fear. They're a surly lot, those Pollocks and
Moggeridges, and up to no good, in my opinion. They're not popular with
the other fishers, and when you find a whole family boycotted by the
rest of them, there's usually something at the back of it."

==> "At any rate," said Wimsey, "I think we've got the actual time of the <==
death pretty well fixed by now. That ought to help."

"Yes," admitted Inspector Umpelty, "if what you and the lady tell me is
correct, that does seem to settle it. Not but what I'd like a doctor's
opinion on it, no offence to you. But I think you're right, all the

"You see, my lord, we haven't been idle, even though suicide looks more
probable than anything else on the face of things. We had to take all
the possibilities into account, and we've gone over the district with,
as you might say, a magnifying glass."

==> After an inspection of the reports, Wimsey was obliged to admit that <==
this boast seemed justified. Chance had helped the police very
considerably. An application had recently been made by the local
authorities to the County Council to have the coast-road between Lesston
Hoe and Wilvercombe put into better repair. The County Council,
conscious that times were bad and that money was tight, had courteously

[line number in individual story] matching line = 4488    window = 4483 4493

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 65384    window = 65379 65389


Lesston Hoe, and, as this young lady says, Wilvercombe is the more
probable direction of the two, because anybody coming from Lesston Hoe
would have seen her and put his crime off to a more convenient season,
as Shakespeare says."

==> "Very well," said Wimsey. "All right. We'll admit that. The murderer <==
didn't take any sort of wheeled conveyance for any part of the journey.
Still, that leaves a lot of possibilities open. We'll wash out the
Lesston Hoe side altogether and only take the Wilvercombe direction. We
now have at least three suggestions. One: the murderer walked by the
road from Wilvercombe or Darley, came down on to the beach at some point

MONDAY, 22 JUNE

==> Wimsey had not very long to wait before hearing the latest development. <==
He had returned to the Bellevue for lunch, and was having a preliminary
refresher in the bar, when he felt a smart tap on his shoulder.

"Lord, Inspector! How you startled me! All right, it's a fair cop.
What's it for this time?"

[line number in individual story] matching line = 4664    window = 4659 4669

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 65560    window = 65555 65565


"Sure thing."

"Well"--the Inspector dropped his voice to a hoarse whisper--"we've
found out what he did with it."

==> Wimsey registered expectation, but this was not enough. Inspector <==
Umpelty evidently felt that he had got hold of a really choice morsel,
and was not going to let it go without full dramatic honours.

"I'll buy it, Inspector. _What_ did he do with it?"


[line number in individual story] matching line = 4683    window = 4678 4688

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 65579    window = 65574 65584


"Into WHAT?"

"Three hundred golden sovereigns--that's what he turned it into. Three
hundred round, golden jimmy o' goblins."

==> Wimsey stared blankly at him. <==

"Three hundred--oh, look here, Inspector, a shock like this is more than
frail flesh and blood can stand. There isn't so much gold in the
country. I haven't seen more than ten gold sovereigns together since I
fought at my grandpapa's side at the Battle of Waterloo. Gold! How did

her bed. Inquest verdict is 'death from natural causes,' which means old
age and semi-starvation with neglected pneumonia on top of it. And of
course plenty of money in the house, including four hundred gold
sovereigns in the mattress. It's always happening."

==> Wimsey nodded. <==

"Yes. Well, then, the long-lost next-of-kin turns up and who should it
be but this old chap from Princemoor, Abel Bennett. There's a will
found, leaving everything to him, and begging him to look after the poor
pussies. He's the executor, and he steps in and takes charge. Very good.

[line number in individual story] matching line = 4738    window = 4733 4743

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 65634    window = 65629 65639


tells old Bennett a rambling kind of story about wanting gold sovereigns
for some purpose or other. Something about wanting to buy a diamond from
a foreign rajah who didn't understand bank-notes--some bosh of that
kind."

==> "He got that out of a book, I expect," said Wimsey. "I've seen something <==
like it somewhere."

"Very likely. Old Bennett, who seems to have had more wits than his
sister, didn't swallow the tale altogether, because, as he said, the
young fellow didn't look to him like a person who would be buying

out here for the purpose of changing it into gold as soon as ever he saw
the account of Ann Bennett's death in the papers. But why he wanted it
or what he did with it, I can't tell you, no more than the Man in the
Moon."

==> "Well," said Wimsey, "I always knew there were one or two oddities about <==
this case, but I don't mind admitting that this beats me. Why on earth
should anybody want to clutter himself up with all that gold? I suppose
we can dismiss the story of the Rajah's Diamond. A £300 diamond is
nothing very out of the way, and if you wanted one you could buy it in
Bond Street, without paying in gold or dragging in Indian potentates."

"That's a fact. Besides, where are you going to find a rajah who doesn't
understand Bank of England notes? These niggers aren't savages, not by
any means. Why, lots of them have been to Oxford."

==> Wimsey made suitable acknowledgment of this tribute to his own <==
university.

"The only explanation that suggests itself to me," he said, "is that
Alexis was contemplating a flitting to some place where Bank of England
notes wouldn't pass current. But I hardly know where that could be at

[line number in individual story] matching line = 4802    window = 4797 4807

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 65698    window = 65693 65703


someone who wanted to skip. That party might be wanting gold for the
very reasons we've been talking about, and he might get Alexis to do the
job of getting it for him, so that he shouldn't appear in it himself.
Alexis pays up, and then goes off the deep end and cuts his throat."

==> "You're very ingenious," said Wimsey. "But I still believe I'm right, <==
though if it is a case of murder, it's been so neatly worked out that
there doesn't seem to be much of a loophole in it. Unless it's the
razor. Look here, Inspector, I've got an idea about the razor, if you'll
let me carry it out. Our one hope is to tempt the murderer, if there is
one, into making a mistake by trying to be too clever."

another. You'd better ask the Super, but if he's got no objection, I'd
say, go ahead. Why not come round and put it to him straight away?"

       *       *       *       *       *

==> On arriving at the police-station, Wimsey and the Inspector found the <==
Superintendent engaged with a crabbed old gentleman in a fisherman's
jersey and boots, who appeared to be suffering under a sense of
grievance.

"Can't a man take 'is own boat out when he likes and where he likes?

"I zee a vule of a woman, caperin' about on the beach, goin' on as if
she was loony. She runs a bit an' stops a bit, an' pokes in the sand and
then runs on a bit. That's what I zee."

==> "I must tell Miss Vane that," said Wimsey to the Inspector. "It will <==
appeal to her sense of humour."

"Oh, you saw a woman, did you? Did you see what she did after that?"

"She runs up to the Vlat-Iron an' starts messin' about there."

"Very well. If your memory should improve in the next few days, you'd
better let us know."

Mr. Pollock muttered something uncomplimentary, and removed himself.

==> "Not an agreeable old gentleman," said Wimsey. <==

"An old scoundrel," said Superintendent Glaisher. "And the worst of it
is, you can't believe a word he says. I'd like to know what he was
really up to."

really up to."

"Murdering Paul Alexis, perhaps?" suggested the Inspector.

"Or conveying the murderer to the scene of the crime for a
==> consideration," added Wimsey. "That's more likely, really. What motive <==
should he have for murdering Alexis?"

"That's the three hundred pounds, my lord. We mustn't forget that. I
know I said it was suicide, and I still think so, but we've got a much
better motive for murder than we had before."

"But why?" objected Umpelty. "Why put him ashore? Wouldn't it have been
easier to cut his throat aboard the boat and drop the body into the
sea?"

==> "No, it wouldn't," said Wimsey, eagerly. "Ever seen 'em stick a pig, <==
Inspector? Ever reckoned how much blood there was to the job? If Pollock
had cut Alexis' throat on board, it would take a devil of a lot of
swabbing to get the boat properly clean again."

"That's quite true," said the Superintendent. "But in any case, how

"That's quite true," said the Superintendent. "But in any case, how
about Pollock's clothes? I'm afraid we haven't got evidence enough to
get a warrant and search his place for bloodstains."

==> "You could wash 'em off oil-skins pretty easily, too," remarked Wimsey. <==

The two policemen acquiesced gloomily.

"And if you stood behind your man and cut his throat that way, you'd
stand a reasonable chance of not getting so very heavily splashed. It's

"I see no objection whatever, my lord. Something might quite well come
of it. In fact," said Mr. Glaisher, "something of the same kind had
passed through my own mind, as you might say. But I don't mind it's
appearing to come from your lordship. Not at all."

==> Wimsey grinned and went in search of Salcombe Hardy, the _Morning Star_ <==
reporter, whom he found, as he expected, taking refreshment in the hotel
bar. Most of the pressmen had withdrawn by this time, but Hardy, with a
touching faith in Lord Peter, had clung to his post.

"Though you're treating me damn badly, old man," he said, raising his

reporter, whom he found, as he expected, taking refreshment in the hotel

touching faith in Lord Peter, had clung to his post.

"Though you're treating me damn badly, old man," he said, raising his

something up your sleeve, or you wouldn't be hanging round the scene of

it isn't the girl. You wouldn't play such a shabby trick on a poor,

gang except me. I know where the news is, and I know how to get it. I
said to myself, You hang on to old Peter, I said, and one of these days
he'll give you a story."

==> "Splendid fellow!" said Wimsey. "May we ne'er lack a friend or a story <==
to give him. Are you reasonably sober, Sally?"

"Sober?" exclaimed the journalist indignantly. "J'ever know a pressman
who wasn't sober when somebody had a story to give him? I may not be a

lounge.

yourself."

surrounding the horrible tragedy at the Flat-Iron deepens steadily with
every effort made to solve it. Far from being a simple case of suicide,
as at first seemed probable, the horrible death----'"

MONDAY, 22 JUNE

==> Wimsey looked at his watch. It was half-past one, and he had had no <==
lunch. He remedied the omission, took the car and drove out to Darley.
He had to wait for a few moments while the gates were opened at the
Halt, and took the opportunity to check up on the police inquiry. He
found that the lame gate-keeper knew the mysterious Mr. Martin by
sight--had, in fact, met him one evening in the bar of the Feathers. A

[line number in individual story] matching line = 5264    window = 5259 5269

come through the railway-wickets. If he had, she would have run away.

This seemed to dispose of the last lingering possibility that the
mysterious Mr. Martin might have left the Feathers rather earlier than
he was supposed to have done, walked to the crossing and been picked up
==> by a car on the other side. Wimsey thanked Rosie with grave courtesy, <==
gave her sixpence and drove on.

His next port of call was, of course, the Feathers. The landlord, Mr.
Lundy, was ready enough with his information. What he had told the
inspector was quite right. He had first seen Mr. Martin on Tuesday--the

[line number in individual story] matching line = 5277    window = 5272 5282

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 66173    window = 66168 66178


mild and bitter and asked the way to Mr. Goodrich's house. Who was Mr.
Goodrich? Why, Mr. Goodrich was the gentleman that owned the land down
by Hinks's Lane, where Mr. Martin had been camping. All the land
thereabouts belonged to Mr. Goodrich.

==> "I want to be clear about this," said Wimsey. "Did Mr. Martin come here <==
from the direction of Hinks's Lane, or which way did he come?"

"No, sir; he drove in along the Heathbury Road and left his car on the
green, same as I said."


[line number in individual story] matching line = 5317    window = 5312 5322

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 66213    window = 66208 66218


something the matter with it, and a passing car had picked him up and
taken him to Wilvercombe and back. Yes, he had lunched heartily: roast
leg of mutton and potatoes and boiled cabbage and a rhubarb pie to
follow.

==> Wimsey shuddered at the thought of roast mutton and cabbage on a red-hot <==
June day, and asked when Mr. Martin had left the inn.

"It would be half-past one, sir, by the right time. Our clocks are all
ten minutes fast, same as the clock in the bar, that's set by the
wireless every day. I couldn't say but what Mr. Martin might have

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 66229    window = 66224 66234


Mr. Martin, so I was able to clear away and get dressed and very pleased
I was about it."

This was clear enough. Mr. Martin had certainly not left the Three
Feathers earlier than 1.30. Undoubtedly he was not the murderer of Paul
==> Alexis. Nevertheless, having begun his investigation, Wimsey determined <==
to carry it through to the bitter end. Alibis, he reminded himself, were
made to be broken. He would suppose that, by means of a magic carpet or
other device, Mr. Martin had been miraculously wafted from Darley to the
Flat-Iron between 1.30 and two o'clock. In that case, did he come back
that afternoon, and if so, when? and how?

vicar had not immediately dismissed Mr. Gubbins from his privilege of
handing round the plate and sitting on the Church Council, and thought
that Mr. Gubbins's action in devoting a tithe of his winnings to the
Restoration Fund merely piled hypocrisy on the head of debauchery. But
now, with the hope that they might be found to have entertained an angel
==> of darkness unawares, they foresaw all manner of publicity. Wimsey <==
discovered several people who thought Mr. Martin's manner odd and had
not liked his face and who said so, at considerable length. It was,
however, only after nearly two hours' patient research that he
discovered somebody who had actually seen Mr. Martin on Thursday
afternoon. This was, of course, the most obvious person in the

[line number in individual story] matching line = 5366    window = 5361 5371

not liked his face and who said so, at considerable length. It was,
however, only after nearly two hours' patient research that he
discovered somebody who had actually seen Mr. Martin on Thursday
afternoon. This was, of course, the most obvious person in the
village--namely the proprietor of the little tin bungalow that did duty
==> for a garage, and the only reason why Wimsey did not get this <==
information a great deal sooner was that the said proprietor--one, Mr.
Polwhistle--had gone out when he first called upon him, to tackle the
internals of a sick petrol-gas engine at a neighbouring farm, leaving
behind him only a young woman to attend to the pump.

the fault might be in the H.T. lead. On their removing this and putting
in a new one, the engine had started up at once, sweet as a nut. There
could be no doubt about the time, because Tom had entered it upon his
time-sheet; 3 p.m. till 4 p.m.

==> It was now nearly half-past four, and Wimsey felt that he had a good <==
chance of finding Mr. Goodrich at home. He was directed to his
house--the big place up the first turning off the Wilvercombe Road--and
found the good gentleman and his family gathered about a table well
spread with bread and cakes and honey and Devonshire cream.

payment for letting the poor devils who lived in towns help themselves
to a mouthful of fresh air and a drink of water. He usually asked them
to leave the place as tidy as they could, and as a rule he had found
them pretty decent in this respect.

==> Wimsey thanked Mr. Goodrich and accepted his hospitable invitation to <==
tea. He left at six o'clock, full of buns and cream, with just nice time
to pay a visit to the camping-ground and so round off the chapter of Mr.
Martin. He drove down the stony little lane, and soon found signs of Mr.
Martin's recent presence. The lane led out upon a flat expanse of rough
turf, beyond which a belt of heavy stones and shingle sloped down to the

[line number in individual story] matching line = 5450    window = 5445 5455

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 66346    window = 66341 66351


coarse grass, and there was a patch of oily drippings to show where it
had been parked. Close by, there were the holes where the pole and pegs
of a small bell-tent had been driven in. There were the ashes of a
burnt-out wood fire, and among them, a ball of greasy newspaper, which
had obviously been used to scrub out a frying-pan. Rather reluctantly,
==> Wimsey unfolded the distasteful sheets and glanced at the heading. <==
Thursday's _Morning Star_; nothing particularly exciting about that.
Careful search among the ashes of the fire revealed no blood-stained
fragments of clothing--not so much as a button of a garment--no
half-burnt scraps of paper which might have contained a clue to Mr.
Martin's real name and address. The only thing that was in any way

Careful search among the ashes of the fire revealed no blood-stained
fragments of clothing--not so much as a button of a garment--no
half-burnt scraps of paper which might have contained a clue to Mr.
Martin's real name and address. The only thing that was in any way
remarkable was a piece of thinnish rope about three inches long, heavily
==> blackened by the fire. Wimsey pocketed this, for lack of better <==
occupation, and searched further.

Mr. Martin had been a tidy camper on the whole, leaving no obviously
offensive débris. On the right-hand side of the camping-ground there
was, however, the remains of a stunted thorn hedge, surrounding the

Mr. Martin had been a tidy camper on the whole, leaving no obviously
offensive débris. On the right-hand side of the camping-ground there
was, however, the remains of a stunted thorn hedge, surrounding the
battered remnants of Hinks's Cottage. Half buried at the foot of this
==> hedge, Wimsey discovered a repulsive cache, containing a great number of <==
old tins and bottles, some recent and some obviously abandoned by
previous campers, the heels of some loaves, the bones from a neck of
mutton, an old dixie with a hole in the bottom, half a neck-tie, a
safety-razor blade (still sharp enough to cut one's fingers on) and a
very dead gull. An elaborate and back-aching crawl over the whole

"Of course not. We'll expect you at 8.45."

"All right, and I hope your rabbit dies."

==> Wimsey ate his solitary dinner thoughtfully. So this was the son, was <==
it? The one who was out of sympathy with his mother. What was he doing
here? Had he suddenly become sympathetic? Or had she sent for him and
compelled him to come in, by financial or other pressure? Was he perhaps
a new factor in the problem? He was the only son of his mother and she a
rich widow. Here at last was a person to whom the removal of Paul Alexis

[line number in individual story] matching line = 5535    window = 5530 5540

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 66431    window = 66426 66436


might appear in the light of a god-send. Undoubtedly the man must be
looked into.

He went round to the Resplendent after dinner and found the party
waiting for him in the lounge. Mrs. Weldon, who wore a plain black
==> semi-evening dress and looked her full age in it, greeted Wimsey <==
effusively.

"My dear Lord Peter! I am so glad to see you. May I introduce my son
Henry? I wrote asking him to come and help us through this terrible
time, and he has _most_ kindly put his own business aside and come to

offered a pregnant suggestion of what his mother's might once have
looked like before it knew the touch of peroxide; indeed, he was, in a
curious way, very like his mother, having the same low, narrow forehead
and the same long and obstinate chin; though, in the mother the
expression was that of a weak, fanciful obstinacy, and, in the son, of
==> stubborn and unimaginative obstinacy. Looking at him, Wimsey felt that <==
he was hardly the sort of man to take kindly to a Paul Alexis for a step
father; he would not sympathise with the sterile romance of any woman
who was past the age of child-bearing. Wimsey, summing him up with the
man of the world's experienced eye, placed him at once as a
gentleman-farmer, who was not quite a gentleman and not much of a

and the same long and obstinate chin; though, in the mother the

At the moment, the understanding between Henry Weldon and his mother

"No, dear, I'm sorry," said Mrs. Weldon, dabbing her eyes apologetically
with a small handkerchief. "It's all been such a shock to me. But I
mustn't be weak and silly. We must all be courageous and work hard and
_do_ something about it."

==> Wimsey suggested that a spot of something or other might do them all <==
good, and, further, that he and Henry might make a concerted masculine
raid on the bar, instructing the waiter to attend upon the ladies. He
felt that he could dissect Henry more conveniently in a private
interview.

look a bit of a fool when his mother proposes to give him a
twenty-year-old lounge lizard for a step-papa. Suppose it's all over the
place now. Bet everybody's grinning at me behind my back. Let 'em grin.
All over now, anyway. Suppose the chappie did do himself in, didn't he?"

==> "It looks like it," admitted Wimsey. <==

"Couldn't face the prospect, eh? All his own fault. Hard-up, I suppose,
poor devil! The old girl's not a bad sort, really. She'd have given the
feller a damn good time if he'd stuck to his bargain. But you can't
trust these foreigners. Like collies--lick your boots one minute and

these tom-fool notions. Enough to send the old dear clean off her
rocker, you know. Once they get those notions in their heads it's a job
to get rid of 'em. Form of mania, don't you think, like women's rights
and crystal-gazing?"

==> Wimsey agreed cautiously that an unreasonable conviction might, in <==
process of time, amount to an obsession.

"That's just what I mean. You've got the word--obsession, that's it.
Well, I don't want the old lady to go wasting her time and money on an
obsession. Look here, Wimsey, you're a sound sort of fellow--brainy and

all that--can't you put her off this Bolshevik idea? She's taken a
notion that you and that Vane girl are encouraging her. Now, take it
from me, old man, that kind of thing won't do at all."

Lord Peter delicately raised his eyebrows.

laugh.

"That's good," he said, "dashed good. What was yours? Martell
Three-Star? Here, Johnnie, same again for this gentleman."

==> "Thank you, no," said Wimsey. "You misunderstood me." <==

"Oh, come--another little spot won't do you any harm. No? Oh, well, if
you won't, you won't. Mine's a Scotch-and-soda. Well, now, we understand
one another, eh?"

nuisance, of course. Suppose we shall be stuck here now till they've
found the body and held an inquest. Don't like these beastly
watering-places. Suits you all right, I daresay. I like a bit more open
air and none of this jazz and dinner-jackets."

==> "Quite right," said Wimsey. <==

"You think so, eh? I was putting you down for something more in the
West-end line. But I suppose you're a bit of a sportsman, too? Huntin',
fishin', that sort of thing, eh?"

==> and I shoot and fish a bit," said Wimsey. "After all, I was brought up <==
in the country, you know. My people have a place in the shires, and our
headquarters is down in Norfolk--Duke's Denver, on the borders of the
Fen country."

"Oh, yes, of course. You're Denver's brother. Never seen the place, but

smart to have escaped so long. Look as if you did yourself pretty well,
too. Lucky your brother's still a youngish man. Death-duties and all
that. Cripple a place, don't they? But I always thought he was a pretty
warm man, for a duke. How's he manage it?"

==> Wimsey explained that the Denver income was not derived from the Denver <==
estate, which was a liability rather than an asset.

"Oh, I see. Well, you're lucky. Takes a man all he can do to get his
living off the land these days."

"Oh, I daresay I shall manage to keep _my_ head out of the noose."

"Out of the--oh, yes--the matrimonial noose. Yes. Ha, ha! All right. I
suppose we'd better go."

==> Mr. Weldon turned away from the bar rather abruptly. Wimsey, reflecting <==
that the ability to swallow insult is a necessary part of the
detective's make-up, restrained the temptation to connect his toe with
Mr. Weldon's rather massive hinder-end, and followed, ruminating.

A message from the waiter informed him that the ladies had adjourned

A message from the waiter informed him that the ladies had adjourned
into the dance-lounge. Henry growled, but was relieved to find that his
mother was, after all, not dancing. She was watching Harriet who, clad
in claret-colour, was revolving smoothly in the practised arm of
==> Antoine. Wimsey politely begged Mrs. Weldon to favour him, but she shook <==
her head.

"I couldn't. Not so soon. In fact, never again--now that Paul----But I
begged Miss Vane to enjoy herself and not mind about me. It is such a
delight to watch her looking so happy."

==> Wimsey sat down and did his best to enjoy the spectacle of Harriet's <==
happiness. As the quick-step came to an end, Antoine, with professional
tact, contrived to end his progress in the neighbourhood of their table
and then, bowing gracefully, melted away. Harriet, a little flushed,
smiled amiably upon Lord Peter.

smiled amiably upon Lord Peter.

"Oh, there you are," said his lordship.

Harriet became suddenly conscious that every woman in the room was
==> gazing furtively or with frank interest at Wimsey and herself, and the <==
knowledge exhilarated her.

"Yes," she said, "here I am. Frivolling. You didn't know I could do it,
did you?"

"Oh, no. I can only do what I like doing."

"We'll see about that."

==> The orchestra swung gently into a dreamy tune. Wimsey advanced upon <==
Harriet and steered her competently out into the centre of the room. For
the first few bars of the music they had the floor to themselves.

"At last," said Wimsey, "we are alone. That is not an original remark,
but I am in no condition to invent epigrams. I have been suffering

"Well?" said Harriet. She was aware that the wine-coloured frock became

"Oh!"

This was not quite the question Harriet had expected. She hastily
collected her ideas. It was very necessary that she should be the

"Why is he here?"

"She sent for him."

"Oh?"

"And I'd like to know why."

"How well you dance." Since he did not say it, she became convinced that
she was dancing like a wax doll with sawdust legs. Wimsey had never
danced with her, never held her in his arms before. It should have been
an epoch-making moment for him. But his mind appeared to be concentrated

"Darling, if you danced like an elderly elephant with arthritis, I would
dance the sun and moon into the sea with you. I have waited a thousand
years to see you dance in that frock."

sit down at the nearest table. "Tell me, what is biting you about Henry
Weldon?"

TUESDAY, 23 JUNE

==> Lord Peter Wimsey, reading his _Morning Star_ over the eggs and bacon, <==
felt better than he had done for some weeks. The _Morning Star_ had come
up to scratch nobly, and was offering £100 reward for information about
the razor that had slain Paul Alexis. Bunter, returning from his
fruitless journey to Eastbourne, had come on to join his master at
Wilvercombe, bringing with him a fresh supply of shirts, collars, and

The great wind had fallen at last. It had rained a little during the
night, but now the sky was fair again, with only the gentlest of breezes
ruffling the blue expanse of sea that was visible from the Bellevue's
dining-room windows. Inspector Umpelty had been out with his helpers to
explore the Grinders at four o'clock that morning, and had just looked
==> in on Wimsey to say that they had found nothing yet. <==

"And why it hasn't come ashore somewhere before this, I don't know," he
grumbled. "We've had a look-out kept all along the coast from Fishy Ness
right up to Seahampton and on both sides of the estuary. Must have got
hooked up with something. If we don't get it within another week, we'll

The ratepayers grumble enough as it is, and we can't keep the witnesses
hanging round here for ever. Well, so long. We shall have another shot

of scribbling paper. Harriet was inclined to be brief and businesslike.

"What system are we going to adopt about this? Do you favour the Michael
Finsbury method by double entry as in _The Wrong Box_? Or one of those

"How professional it looks," said Harriet. "A nice little set of
problems for Robert Templeton. The only thing I can do much about is
interviewing this Leila person and her new young man. I fancy I might
get more out of them than the police could."

mournfully. "We'd better go on to the next."

"No." The hairdresser blushed painfully. "I'm not a robust man. I
couldn't get passed for active service."

==> "All right," said Wimsey. "About the razor. What are you doing now?" <==

"Well, my lord, I am, as you might say, an itinerant hairdresser. I go
from one place to the other, especially seaside towns during the season,
and take temporary posts."

had tried hard to overcome.

Hardy poured himself out a second glass of whisky, and carelessly left
the bottle on the window-sill, out of Mr. Bright's reach.

==> "In the matter of the razor," said Wimsey, patiently. <==

"Yes, my lord. I got that razor in Seahampton, from the place where I
tried to get work. Merryweather, the name was. I needed a new razor, and
he was willing to sell this one cheap."

up and gave me a pleasant nod and away he went, and that's the last I
saw of him. I wish I'd known what he wanted with the razor, or I
wouldn't have given it to him, but there! how was I to know, I ask you,
gentlemen?"

==> "Sounds like Paul Alexis, right enough," said Wimsey, thoughtfully. <==

"He didn't actually say who he was, I suppose?" suggested Hardy.

"No, he didn't; but he said he was a professional dancing-partner at one
of the hotels, and wasn't it one hell of a life for a man that ought to

"No, he didn't; but he said he was a professional dancing-partner at one
of the hotels, and wasn't it one hell of a life for a man that ought to
be a prince in his own country--making love to ugly old women at
twopence-halfpenny a time. Very bitter he sounded."

==> "Well," said Wimsey, "we're very much obliged to you, Mr. Bright. That <==
seems to clear the whole thing up quite satisfactorily. I think you'll
have to let the police know about it."

Mr. Bright looked uneasy at the mention of the police.

have to let the police know about it."

Mr. Bright looked uneasy at the mention of the police.

==> "Better come along now and get it over," said Wimsey, jumping to his <==
feet. "You can't very well get out of it, and, hang it all, man! there's
nothing in it for anybody to worry you about."

The hairdresser agreed, reluctantly, and fastened his pale eyes on Sally
Hardy.

dragging the bay near the Grinders again this afternoon, and we're sure
to get something before long. I'll be glad when we do. Makes one feel
kind of foolish to be carrying on an investigation without a body to
show for it."

==> "Satisfied?" asked Hardy, as Wimsey returned from the police-station. He <==
had telephoned his story to Town and was absorbing a little refreshment
after his labours.

"I ought to be," replied his lordship. "The only thing that worries me,
Sally, is that if I'd wanted to invent a story to fit this case, that is

at two o'clock on Thursday afternoon."

"What an obstinate devil you are," said Mr. Hardy. "Fact is, you're so
damned keen on a murder, you smell murder everywhere. Forget it."

==> Wimsey was silent, but when he had got rid of Sally Hardy, he drew out <==
of his pocket a small leaflet entitled "Tide Tables," and studied it
carefully.

"I thought so," he said.

"But understand me," said Antoine who, like most Frenchmen, was
fundamentally serious and domestic, "I do not say that love is not
important. It is no doubt agreeable to love, and to marry an amiable

TUESDAY, 23 JUNE

==> If either Harriet Vane or Lord Peter Wimsey felt any embarrassment at <==
meeting again after their burst of free speech, they did not show it.
Both had a story to tell, and were thus spared the awkwardness of being
gravelled for lack of matter.

"Cipher letters? Is it possible that Mrs. Weldon is all right and that

Great activity out at sea! Two boats stationed off the Grinders."

"Fishermen?"

==> "Fishers of men, I fancy," replied Wimsey, grimly. "It's Umpelty and his <==
merry men. Pass me the field glasses, Bunter. Yes. They look very busy.
They've got the drags out. Have a squint."

He passed the glasses to Harriet, who exclaimed:

lending a hand one of the men is hanging on at the other end for dear
life to trim the boat. Oh, oh! you didn't see that. What a pity!
Something gave way suddenly, and Inspector Umpelty has gone head over
heels backwards into the boat. Now he's sitting up and rubbing himself."

==> "Dear Umpelty!" Wimsey helped himself to a sandwich. <==

"They're dragging again; he's left it to the fishermen this time....
They've got it--they're hauling--it's coming up!"

"Sit down and have your tea."

"Don't be silly. They're pulling away like anything. There's something
black just showing----"

"Here! Let's have a look."

==> Harriet surrendered the glasses. They were Wimsey's, after all, though <==
if he thought that she would be upset by a distant view of what she had
once seen so unpleasantly close----

Wimsey looked and began to laugh.

"Here, take them, quick! It's a bit of old iron. It looks like a boiler
or something. Don't miss Umpelty's face; it's worth seeing."

"Yes; that's what it is--a sort of cylinder. I wonder how that got

He's a genius."

"Yes. Hurry up. I want to have another look at that cleft in the rock
before we start."

==> The cleft, however, remained an enigma. Wimsey's attention was <==
concentrated on the ring-bolt.

"I'll swear," he said, "that this hasn't been here more than a
fortnight. It looks perfectly new, and the ring isn't worn anywhere.
What the devil he can have wanted that for----Well, let us be going.

Wimsey, though he searched carefully, paused a good many times to scan
sea and shore, and appeared to be computing distances and memorising
landmarks. Each explorer carried a satchel in which to store
treasure-trove, and the conversation, such as it was, rather resembled
the dialogue of a Russian tragedy. Thus:--

       *       *       *       *       *

They toiled along, presently coming abreast of the spot where the lane
led down from Pollock's cottage. Here the beach became more shingly,
==> with a number of biggish stones. Wimsey took the search more seriously <==
here, scrutinising the stones above and around high-water mark very
carefully, and even going part of the way up the lane. He seemed not to
find anything of importance, and they went on, noticing that the high
ground hid the cottages from sight of the beach.

till we are married. You shall fall off a horse every day till you learn

==> Harriet was silent. She suddenly saw Wimsey in a new light. She knew him <==
to be intelligent, clean, courteous, wealthy, well-read, amusing and
enamoured, but he had not so far produced in her that crushing sense of
utter inferiority which leads to prostration and hero-worship. But she
now realised that there was, after all, something god-like about him. He
could control a horse. She had a fleeting vision of him, very sleek,

attendance not very far off. We can't hope to find anything more along
here. Two horseshoes would be a work of supererogation."

Harriet heartily welcomed this decision.

==> "We needn't crawl up the cliff," Wimsey went on. "We'll turn up and get <==
to the road by the lane. We'll chuck the Bible and the boot--I don't
think they'll get us anywhere."

"Where are we going?"

The two or three miles to Darley were quickly covered, with only the
necessary pause while the gates were opened at the Halt. At the top of
Hinks's Lane they got out and walked down to the camping-place.

==> "I would draw your attention," said Wimsey, "to the three grains of oats <==
found at this spot, and also to the two inches of burnt rope found in
the ashes. Bunter, have you brought those things?"

"Yes, my lord."


[line number in individual story] matching line = 8038    window = 8033 8043

the ashes. Bunter, have you brought those things?"

"Yes, my lord."

Bunter rummaged in the bowels of the car and brought out a small paper
==> bag and a halter. These he handed over to Wimsey, who immediately undid <==
the bag and from it poured a couple of handfuls of oats into his hat.

"Well," he said, "we've got the halter--now we've only got to find a
horse to put in it. Let's go round by the shore to look for the stream
our friend Mr. Goodrich spoke of."

shoved in and secured with wire. I agree that Mr. Newcombe is not a good
hand at mending hedges. Still, he has taken some precautions, so we will
hope that our horse is still in the field. We scramble up the bank--we
look over the hedge--one, two, three horses, by jove!"

==> Wimsey let his eye rove meditatively over the large field. At its far <==
side was a thickish clump of spinney, from which the little stream
emerged, meandering quietly through the coarse grass.

"Look how nicely those trees screen it from the road and the village. A
pleasant, private spot for horse-stealing. How tiresome of Mr. Newcombe

"Not the black. He looks too big and heavy."

"No, not the black, certainly. The chestnut might do, as regards size,
but he has seen his best days and has hardly got class enough for our
work. The jolly little bay cob rather takes my fancy. Coo-op, pretty,"
==> said Wimsey, advancing delicately across the field, shaking the oats in <==
the hat. "Coo-op, coo-op."

Harriet had often wondered how people ever managed to catch horses in
large fields. It seemed so silly of the creatures to allow themselves to
be taken--and indeed, she remembered distinctly having once stayed in a

country rectory where it always took at least an hour for "the boy" to
catch the pony, with the result that the pony-trap frequently failed to
catch the train. Possibly "the boy" had not gone the right way about it,
for, as by the miracle by which the needle turns to the pole, all three
horses came lolloping steadily across the field to poke soft noses into
==> the hatful of oats. Wimsey stroked the chestnut, patted the black, <==
weeded out the bay from between them and stood for a little talking to
it and running a hand gently over its neck and shoulders. Then he
stooped, passing his palm down the off-fore leg. The hoof came
obediently up into his hand, while the muzzle went round and gently
nibbled his ear.

stooped, passing his palm down the off-fore leg. The hoof came
obediently up into his hand, while the muzzle went round and gently
nibbled his ear.

==> "Hi, you!" said Wimsey, "that's mine. Look here, Harriet." <==

Harriet edged round to his side and stared at the hoof.

"New shoe." He put the foot down and reached in turn for the other legs.
"Better make sure they haven't made an all-round job of it. No; old

Bunter held out his hand for the hat; she relinquished it with a little
start. Bunter shook out the remaining oats, dusted the hat with care
inside and out and restored it to its proper shape.

==> "Handy to ride or drive," said Wimsey, coming back and slipping down <==
from his mount. "Might do nine miles an hour on the road--on the shore,
through shallow water, say eight. I'd like--my God! how I'd like--to
take her along to the Flat-Iron. Better not. We're trespassing."

He pulled the halter off and sent the mare off with a clap on the

mind. Let's check up on our facts, just as though the thing were coming
out all right."

They left the field and walked up Hinks's Lane.

==> "We won't take the car," said Wimsey. "We'll just wander along chewing <==
straws and looking idle. Yonder is the village green, I fancy, where, as
you once informed us, under a spreading chestnut tree the village smithy
stands. Let us hope the smith is at work. Smiths, like electric drills,
are made to be stared at."

The smith was at work. The cheerful clink of his hammer fell cheerily on
their ears as they crossed the green, and the huge dappled quarters of a
cart-horse gleamed in the shaft of sunlight that fell across the open
door.

==> Harriet and Wimsey lounged up, Wimsey dangling the horseshoe in his <==
hand.

"Afternoon, zur," said the yokel in charge of the cart-horse, civilly.

"'Noon," replied Wimsey.

The yokel looked Wimsey over thoroughly, and decided that he was a

After about five minutes, Wimsey judged that the time had come when a

The smith leaned on his hammer and considered the matter. By slow

Farmer Newcombe always kept horses in that field during the summer
months. No, he never mowed that meadow on account of the (agricultural
and botanical detail of which Harriet did not grasp the significance).
No, Mr. Newcombe wouldn't be about in that meadow much, no, nor yet the

£300 in gold on him, and there's plenty as 'ud do murder for less than
that. At least, we're supposing he had it on him. We can't tell till we
find the body."

"If he was murdered for the sake of the gold, you won't know even then,"

"No, my lord, that's a fact. Unless we was to find the belt or what not
he had it in. And even then, likely as not, the murderer would have
taken belt and all." The Inspector looked unhappy. "But there might be

he had it in. And even then, likely as not, the murderer would have
taken belt and all." The Inspector looked unhappy. "But there might be
papers or something to tell us--always supposing the murderer didn't
take them as well or the salt water hasn't made pulp of them."

==> "D'you know," said Wimsey, "I feel inspired to make a prophecy. I think <==
you'll find that Alexis was murdered all right, but not for the sake of
the money. I mean, not for the £300."

"Why do you think that, my lord?"

The Inspector scratched his head.

"You don't mean that somebody came and took the body away? What should
they want to do that for?"

==> Wimsey went back to the Bellevue and found a note from Harriet, <==
containing the substance of her conversation with Mrs. Weldon. He
frowned over it for a moment and then abruptly summoned Bunter.

"Bunter, my man," said he, "I think it is time you took a trip to
Huntingdonshire."

"Very good, my lord. Your lordship's dress-shirts are in the second
drawer and the silk socks in the tray on the right-hand side of the
wardrobe, with the dress-ties just above them."

==> "Very good, Bunter," said Wimsey, mechanically. <==

Ten minutes later Mr. Bunter, suitcase in hand, was on his way to the
railway-station.

garments would not do. Her appointment was with Mrs. Weldon and Henry.

The curious inhibitions which caused her to be abrupt, harsh, and
irritating with Lord Peter did not seem to trouble her in dealing with
Henry Weldon. For him she produced a latent strain of sweet womanliness
==> which would have surprised Wimsey. She now selected a slinky garment, <==
composed of what male writers call "some soft, clinging material," with
a corsage which outlined the figure and a skirt which waved
tempestuously about her ankles. She enhanced its appeal with an
oversized hat of which one side obscured her face and tickled her
shoulder, while the other was turned back to reveal a bunch of black

the hat and blew his confidences on to Harriet's cheek. "I wish you'd do
something for me."

"Of course, I'd do anything I could."

==> "That's nice of you. Do persuade this Wimsey fellow to drop it. As long <==
as _she_ thinks there's anything in that Bolshie idea of hers, she'll
hang on here like grim death. It isn't good for her--morbid, you know.
Besides, she's making an ass of herself. I want to get her away and go
back to my work."

promiscuous?

That was it--he did! He was informing her now, in reasonably plain
language, that somebody like himself would be a nice change for her and
that he couldn't make out what a fine woman like herself could see in a
==> fellow like Wimsey. Rage rendered her speechless for a moment; then she <==
began to feel amused. If he thought that, he could be made to believe
anything. She could twist men round her little finger, could she? Then
she would twist _him_. She would fool him to the top of his bent.

She begged him not to talk so loudly; Mrs. Weldon would overhear him.

insisted on walking back to her room at Mrs. Lefranc's. She would not
allow Henry to go with her--she wouldn't hear of it--she was quite all
right--the walk would do her good. Henry, who was still offended, did
not press the point. Harriet walked away, but not to Mrs. Lefranc's. She
hastened to the nearest telephone-cabinet and rang up the Bellevue. Was
==> Lord Peter Wimsey there? No, he was out; could they take a message? Yes. <==
Would he please come round and see Miss Vane at once, the minute he came
in? It was frightfully urgent. Certainly they would tell him. No, they
would not forget.

Harriet went home, sat down on Paul Alexis' chair and stared at Paul

"Haviland Martin?"

"Haviland Martin."

==> Wimsey walked very deliberately to a table near the window, laid down <==
his hat and stick upon it, drew forward a chair, placed Harriet in it,
drew up a second chair, sat down in it himself, and said:

"You win. I am astonished. I am thunderstruck. Kindly explain yourself.
I thought you were out this afternoon with the Weldons."

"Only in the interests of justice. Besides, I boxed his ears."

"Go on. Begin from the beginning."

==> Harriet began from the beginning. Wimsey bore fairly well the story of <==
the vamping of Henry Weldon, merely interjecting that he hoped the man
wouldn't make himself a nuisance later on, and listened patiently till
she came to the incident of the plate-washing.

"I was sort of wriggling--because I didn't want him actually to kiss me,

"No, he couldn't--could he? Oh, what an idiot I am! I've been sitting
here having the horrors, and wondering how in the world we could ever
break it to Mrs. Weldon."

==> "We may have to do that in any case, I'm afraid," said Wimsey, gravely. <==
"It looks very much as if he had some hand in it, even if he didn't do
the throat-cutting part of it. The only thing is, if he wasn't the
actual murderer, why was he at Darley at all?"

"Goodness knows!"

THURSDAY, 25 JUNE

==> Mr. Weldon did not bolt. Wimsey had no difficulty in catching him the <==
following morning, and was rather glad he had waited, for in the
meantime he had received a letter from Chief Inspector Parker.

     "MY DEAR PETER,


[line number in individual story] matching line = 9379    window = 9374 9384

                                                       "CHARLES."

==> Thus armed, Wimsey descended on Henry Weldon, who greeted him with his <==
usual offensive familiarity. Lord Peter bore with this as long as he
thought advisable, and then said, carelessly:

"By the way, Weldon--you gave Miss Vane quite a turn yesterday
afternoon."

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 70286    window = 70281 70291



Henry looked at him rather unpleasantly.

"Oh! did I? Well, I don't see why you need to come butting in."

==> "I wasn't referring to your manners," said Wimsey, "though I admit they <==
are a bit startling. But why didn't you mention that you and she had met
before?"

"Met before? For the very simple reason that we never have met before."

"Oh!" Henry stared for a few moments; then a slow grin spread itself
over his face.

"So that's what the little hussy meant when she said she'd seen a snake.
==> Sharp girl, that, Wimsey. Fancy her spotting that." <==

"Manners, please!" said Wimsey. "You will kindly refer to Miss Vane in a
proper way and spare me the boring nuisance of pushing your teeth out at
the back of your neck."

a devil of a scene with my mother, and been cut off with a shilling, I
suppose. No. My idea was to snoop around and see whether the job was
really being put through, and, if it was, to get hold of the young
blighter and buy him off privately."

==> "You'd have needed some cash to do that," said Wimsey, drily. <==

"I don't know about that. I'd heard some stories about a girl down here,
don't you see, and if my mother got to know about that----"

"Ah, yes--a qualified form of blackmail. I begin to see the idea. You

"Ah! But when a young lady asks for it--besides, I rather wanted to find
out what the girl--the lady, that is, was after. When your mother's
pretty well off, don't you see, you rather get the idea that people are
looking out to make a bit out of her."

==> Wimsey laughed. <==

"So you thought you'd vamp Miss Vane and find out. How great minds do
think alike! She had rather the same idea about you. Wondered why you
were so damned anxious to push her and me out of the place. I'm not
surprised you each found the other so easy to talk to. Miss Vane said

[line number in individual story] matching line = 9527    window = 9522 9532

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 70423    window = 70418 70428


surprised you each found the other so easy to talk to. Miss Vane said
she was afraid you had seen through our little plot and were pulling her
leg. Well, well! So now we can come out into the open and be perfectly
frank with one another. So much jollier and all that, what?"

==> Henry Weldon looked at Wimsey suspiciously. He had a dim notion that he <==
had somehow been jockeyed into an absurd position. It was all very
well--that damned girl and this chattering lunatic of an amateur
detective seemed to be working hand in glove. But it did cross his mind
that all this talk about frankness was a little one-sided.


[line number in individual story] matching line = 9536    window = 9531 9541

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 70432    window = 70427 70437


that all this talk about frankness was a little one-sided.

"Oh yes, rather!" he replied, vaguely; adding rather anxiously: "No need
to tell my mother all about this, eh? She wouldn't like it."

==> "Possibly not," said Wimsey. "But you see--the police, what? I don't <==
quite see--British justice--duties of a citizen and all that, don't you
know. I can't prevent Miss Vane from going to Inspector Umpelty, can I?
Free agent and so on--and she's not over and above pleased with you,
from what I can make out."

"I never thought to ask. But I do remember the number of the car--it
was a comic one: OI 0101--sort of thing you couldn't help
remembering--Oi-oi-oi! I said to this woman what a funny one it was
and we laughed about it a good bit."

==> "Ha ha!" said Wimsey, "that's a good one. Oi-oi-oi!" <==

"Yes--it made us both laugh. I remember saying it was a bit unfortunate
having a number like that, because it 'ud stick in a bobby's mind.
Oi-oi-oi!" Mr. Weldon yodelled gleefully.

"Nosey-parkering. I was struggling with the infernal car, and he stood
about asking silly questions. I told him to clear out--standing there
bleating 'Won't it start?' Blasted little idiot!"

==> Wimsey laughed. "He can't be our man, anyhow." <==

"What man? The murderer? You still want to make out it's murder? Well,
I'll swear that little shrimp had nothing to do with it. Sunday-school
teacher, that's what he looked like."

and had just developed it up and identified it as a fellow called Alexis
from the Resplendent. You ask the bobby, and he'll tell you. So I began
to think I'd better pop off home, because that's where my mother would
expect condolences to come from. How's that, eh?"

==> "Overwhelming," said Wimsey. <==

He left Henry Weldon and made for the police-station.

"Water-tight, water-tight, water-tight," he muttered to himself. "But
why did he lie about the horse? He must have seen it, if it was running

for talking too freely; but the fact remained that Weldon had been told
of the identification that night.

"So what have we got left?" inquired Superintendent Glaisher.

==> Wimsey shook his head. <==

"Nothing very much, but still, something. First: Weldon knows something
about that horse--I'll swear he does. He hesitated when I asked him if
he'd seen any person, thing, _or animal_, and I am almost certain he was
wondering whether to say 'No' or to make up a tarradiddle. Secondly: All

meet--quite one of the old school. We'll just find out how well he knows
this Mrs. Morecambe, but I expect it's all right. As to this
identification, I don't know that it's worth while."

"You probably couldn't expect her to identify him without his dark hair
==> and glasses," said Wimsey. "It's astonishing what a difference it makes <==
having the eyes concealed. You could make him put the spectacles on, of
course, or you could bring her over and get _him_ to identify _her_.
I'll tell you what. Ring up again and ask if she can come over here now.
I'll get hold of Weldon and park him out on the verandah of the
Resplendent, and you can fetch her along casually. If he spots her,

"Good. I'll toddle round and try to detach Weldon from his mamma. If
she's present at the interview the good Henry will be in the soup. If I
can't get him, I'll ring you."

Henry Weldon was readily found in the lounge. He was having tea with his
==> mother, but excused himself when Wimsey came up and asked for a word in <==
private. They selected a table about half-way along the verandah, and
Weldon ordered drinks, while Wimsey embarked on a rather verbose account
of his interview with the police that morning. He harped a good deal on
the trouble he had taken to persuade Glaisher not to let the story come
to Mrs. Weldon's ears, and Henry expressed a proper sense of gratitude.

Presently a burly figure made his appearance, looking exactly like a
police-constable out of uniform, and escorting a rather young-old lady,
dressed in the extreme of fashion. They passed slowly along the
verandah, which was well filled with people, making for an empty table
==> at the far end. Wimsey watched the lady's glance roam over the assembly; <==
it rested on him, passed on to Weldon and then, without pause or sign of
recognition, to a young man in blue glasses who was toying with a
chocolate sundæ at the next table. Here it paused for a moment--then it
moved on again. At the same time Weldon gave quite a convulsive start.

==> "I bet your pardon," said Wimsey, breaking off short in his monologue. <==
"Did you speak?"

"I--er--no," said Weldon. "I thought I recognised somebody, that's all.
Probably a chance resemblance." He followed Mrs. Morecambe with his eyes
as she approached them, and raised a tentative hand to his hat.

tremendously grateful to you for having taken compassion on me that
day."

"Not at all; it was a pleasure."

grinned.

"So that was your attractive lady. Well, well. You're a gay dog, Weldon.
Young or old, they all go down before you, spectacles or no spectacles."

"Chuck it!" said Henry, not displeased. "Lucky thing her turning up like
that, wasn't it?"

"Don't like the hick she's got with her, though," pursued Henry. "One of
the local turnip-heads, I suppose."

Wimsey grinned again. Could anybody be as slow-witted as Henry made

"I ought to have tried to find out who she was," said Henry, "but I
thought it would look a bit pointed. Still, I daresay they'll be able to
trace her, won't they? It's rather important to me, you know."

"Yes, it is, isn't it? Very good-looking and well-off, too, from the
looks of her. I congratulate you, Weldon. Shall I try and trace her for
you? I'm a most skilful go-between and an accomplished gooseberry."

==> "Don't be an ass, Wimsey. She's my alibi, you idiot." <==

"So she is! Well, here goes!"

Wimsey slipped away, chuckling to himself.

thought, about 1.45. He had then seen someone on the Flat-Iron rock,
either sitting or lying down, but whether dead or alive he could not
say.

The last witness was William Bright, who told the story about the razor
==> in almost exactly the same terms that he had used to Wimsey and the <==
police. The coroner, glancing at a note handed up to him by Umpelty,
allowed him to finish what he had to say, and then asked:

"You say this happened at midnight on Tuesday, 16 June?"

that of Miss Vane. Further, there was no evidence that anybody had the
slightest motive for doing away with the deceased, unless the jury chose
to pay attention to the vague suggestions about blackmailers and
Bolsheviks, which there was not an atom of testimony to support.

==> Wimsey grinned at Umpelty over this convenient summary, with its useful <==
suppressions and assumptions. No mention of clefts in the rock or of
horseshoes or of the disposal of Mrs. Weldon's money. The jury whispered
together. There was a pause. Harriet looked at Henry Weldon. He was
frowning heavily and paying no attention to his mother, who was talking
excitedly into his ear.

that's what we all say. Put it down, sir, as that's our opinion."

When empire comes in at the door, logic goes out at the window. Well, I
suppose that's all. I say, Inspector."

There's street-betting, and drunk and disorderly, and buying stuff
after closing-hours and so on--little odds-and-ends that come in handy
at times."

Dora! Well, I must be getting along. Hullo, Weldon! I didn't know you
were there."

takes the trouble to put her clothes on----"

being in love! I'm losing my lightness of touch." Weldon merely grinned.

"No offence," he said. "I only meant--take that evidence of hers. How's
a girl like that to be expected to know about blood and all that--see
what I mean? Women always get that idea of blood running about all over

contrary."

"Ye-es," replied Mr. Weldon. "What I mean is, you know, they think a
thing ought to be so, and so they say it is so."

==> "Yes; I grasped that that was what you meant." Wimsey thought that if <==
ever human being had the air of repeating a formula without a clear idea
of its meaning, Mr. Weldon was that human being; yet he pronounced the
magic words with a kind of pride, taking credit to himself for a
discovery.

ever human being had the air of repeating a formula without a clear idea
of its meaning, Mr. Weldon was that human being; yet he pronounced the
magic words with a kind of pride, taking credit to himself for a

==> "What you really mean," went on Wimsey, "is, I take it, that we can't <==
rely on Miss Vane's evidence at all? You say: She hears a shriek, she
finds a man with his throat cut and razor beside him; it looks as though
he'd that moment committed suicide, therefore she takes it for granted
that he _has_ that moment committed suicide. In that case the blood
ought to be still flowing. Therefore she persuades herself that it _was_

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 71770    window = 71765 71775


"Of course," he said. "Yes. I see that. Obviously it must have been
suicide, and Miss Vane's evidence proves that it was. So she must be
right after all."

This was a syllogistic monstrosity even worse than the last, thought
==> Wimsey. A man who could reason like that could not reason at all. He <==
constructed a new syllogism for himself.

     _The man who committed this murder was not a fool._
     _Weldon is a fool._
     _Therefore Weldon did not commit this murder._

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 71780    window = 71775 71785


     _Therefore Weldon did not commit this murder._

That appeared to be sound, so far as it went. But what was Weldon
bothering about, in that case? One could only suppose that he was
worried over having no perfect alibi for two o'clock. And indeed that
==> was worrying Wimsey himself. All the best murderers have alibis for the <==
time of the murder.

Then, suddenly, illumination came flooding, stabbing across the dark
places of his mind like a searchlight. And, good God! if this was the
true solution, Weldon was anything but a fool. He was one of the

time of the murder.

Then, suddenly, illumination came flooding, stabbing across the dark
places of his mind like a searchlight. And, good God! if this was the
true solution, Weldon was anything but a fool. He was one of the
==> subtlest criminals a detective had ever encountered. Wimsey studied <==
Weldon's obstinate profile--was it possible? Yes, it was possible--and
the scheme might quite well have been successful, if only Harriet Vane
had not turned up with her evidence.

Work it out this way; see how it looked. Weldon had murdered Alexis at

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 71847    window = 71842 71852


that awkward testimony as to the time of the death. He knew better than
anyone that death at two o'clock was no proof of suicide, whatever it
might appear to a coroner's jury. He was not stupid; he was shamming
stupid, and doing it damned well.

==> Wimsey was vaguely aware that Weldon was bidding him good-bye in some <==
form of words or other. He let him go readily, eagerly. He wanted to
think this thing over.

A little concentration in the privacy of his own room brought him to a
point from which he could begin to work forward with some assurance.

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 71858    window = 71853 71863



The original scheme had been smashed to pieces by Harriet's evidence.
What would Weldon do next?

He might do nothing. That would be the safest way of all. He might rely
==> on the coroner's verdict and trust that the police and Wimsey and <==
Harriet and everybody else would accept it. But would he have the deadly
courage to do that? He might--unless he knew of something in that cipher
document which might prove the suicide to be murder. If so, or if he
lost his head--then he would have to fall back on his second line of
defence, which would be, what? Undoubtedly, an alibi for two

document which might prove the suicide to be murder. If so, or if he
lost his head--then he would have to fall back on his second line of
defence, which would be, what? Undoubtedly, an alibi for two
o'clock--the real time of the murder.

==> What had he actually said about this? Wimsey looked up his notes, to <==
which he had added considerably of late. Weldon had vaguely mentioned a
possible witness, a man unknown who had been passing through Darley and
had asked him the time.

Of course, yes. He had suspected this witness already--that stock

which he had added considerably of late. Weldon had vaguely mentioned a
possible witness, a man unknown who had been passing through Darley and
had asked him the time.

Of course, yes. He had suspected this witness already--that stock
==> character of detective fiction--the man who asks the time. Wimsey <==
laughed. Now he felt sure about it. Everything was provided for and the
way discreetly paved for the production of this useful witness in case
of necessity. Now that the morning alibi had failed to draw the enemy's
fire, the two o'clock alibi would be pushed to the front. Only, this
time, it would not be cast-iron. It would be a fake. Quite a good fake,

"whether the new book would be available for publication in the autumn"
had driven her back to the problem of the town-clock, but she found
herself giving it a very divided attention. Compared with the remarkable
tangle of the Alexis affair, the plot seemed to be thin and obvious,
while the ape-like Robert Templeton began to display a tiresome tendency
==> to talk like Lord Peter Wimsey. Harriet continually found herself <==
putting her work aside--"to clear" (as though it were coffee). Novelists
who have struck a snag in the working-out of the plot are rather given
to handing the problem over in this way to the clarifying action of the
sub-conscious. Unhappily, Harriet's sub-conscious had other coffee to
clear and refused quite definitely to deal with the matter of the

obstinately refused to work. Harriet groaned in spirit and turned to
crosswords, with the aid of Chambers' Dictionary--that Bible of the
crossword fan--which she found wedged in between a paper-covered book
printed in Russian and _A Bid for the Throne_.

==> Lord Peter Wimsey had also found something to read, which was occupying <==
both his conscious and his sub-conscious very pleasantly. It was a
letter, dated from Leamhurst in Huntingdonshire, and ran thus:

     "MY LORD,

==> This document reached Wimsey on the Saturday afternoon, and in the <==
evening he received a visit from Inspector Umpelty, to whom he submitted
it.

The inspector nodded.

"Yes," replied the Inspector, with modest triumph, and yet with a kind
of mental reservation behind the triumph, "the fair Feodora--only she
says she isn't."

==> Wimsey raised his eyebrows, or, to be more accurate, the one eyebrow <==
which was not occupied in keeping his monocle in place.

"Then if she isn't herself, who is she?"

"She says she's Olga Kohn. I've got her letter here." The Inspector

"She says she's Olga Kohn. I've got her letter here." The Inspector
rummaged in his breast pocket. "Writes a good letter, and in a very
pretty hand, I must say."

==> Wimsey took the blue sheet of paper and cocked a knowing eye at it. <==

"Very dainty. As supplied by Mr. Selfridge's fancy counter to the
nobility and gentry. Ornate initial 'O' in royal blue and gilt. A pretty
hand, as you say, highly self-conscious. Intensely elegant envelope to
match; posted in the Piccadilly district last post on Friday night, and

Have you a photograph of him, by the way?"

The Inspector had an excellent snapshot, taken at the inquest by a press
photographer. A wire was sent to Miss Olga Kohn, warning her of the
impending visit and, having made the necessary arrangements at the
==> police-station, the Inspector heaved his large bulk into Wimsey's <==
Daimler and was transported with perilous swiftness to London. They ran
up that night, snatched a few hours of repose at Wimsey's flat and, in
the morning, set out for Regent Square.

Regent Square is anything but a high-class locality, being chiefly

the morning, set out for Regent Square.

Regent Square is anything but a high-class locality, being chiefly
populated by grubby infants and ladies of doubtful calling, but its
rents are comparatively cheap for so central a situation. On mounting to

agreeably surprised to discover a freshly-painted green door with the
name "Miss O. Kohn" neatly written upon a white card and attached to the
panel by drawing-pins. The brass knocker, representing the Lincoln Imp,
was highly polished. At its summons the door was opened at once by a
handsome young woman, the original of the photograph, who welcomed them

handsome young woman, the original of the photograph, who welcomed them
in with a smile.

"Inspector Umpelty?"

==> "Yes, miss. You will be Miss Kohn, I take it? This is Lord Peter Wimsey, <==
who has been kind enough to run me up to Town."

"Very pleased to meet you," said Miss Kohn. "Come in." She ushered them
into a pleasantly furnished room, with orange window-curtains and bowls
of roses placed here and there on low tables and a general air of

"Mr. Simons, my fiancé," explained Miss Kohn. "Do sit down, and please
smoke. Can I offer you any refreshment?"

Declining the refreshment, and heartily wishing Mr. Simons out of the
way, the Inspector embarked at once on the subject of the photograph,
==> but it soon became obvious both to Wimsey and himself that Miss Kohn had <==
told in her letter nothing more or less than the exact truth. Sincerity
was stamped on every feature of her face as she assured them repeatedly
that she had never known Paul Alexis and never given him a photograph
under the name of Feodora or any other name. They showed her his
photograph, but she shook her head.

under the name of Feodora or any other name. They showed her his
photograph, but she shook her head.

"I am perfectly positive that I never saw him in my life."

==> Wimsey suggested that he might have seen her at a mannequin parade and <==
endeavoured to introduce himself.

"Of course, he may have seen me; so many people see me," replied Miss
Kohn, with artless self-importance. "Some of them try to get off with
one too, naturally. A girl in my position has to know how to look after

back.

"Well, it means nothing to me," said Olga Kohn. "I do hope you all
believe that."

==> "I believe you," said Wimsey, suddenly, "and I'm going to hazard a <==
suggestion. This Alexis fellow was a romantic sort of blighter. Do you
think he can have seen the photograph somewhere and fallen in love with
it, as you might say? What I mean is, he might have indulged in an

was beloved and all the rest of it, and put a fancy name on to support

"But I don't suppose they'll remember much about it," said Olga. "They
see so many people. Still, you could try. I should be terribly glad to
have the thing cleared up. But you do believe me, don't you?"

==> "We believe in you, Miss Kohn," said Wimsey, solemnly, "as devoutly as <==
in the second law of thermo-dynamics."

"What are you getting at?" said Mr. Simons, suspiciously.

"The second law of thermo-dynamics," explained Wimsey, helpfully, "which

"We believe in you, Miss Kohn," said Wimsey, solemnly, "as devoutly as

holds the universe in its path, and without which time would run
backwards like a cinema film wound the wrong way."

"No, would it?" exclaimed Miss Kohn, rather pleased.

holds the universe in its path, and without which time would run
backwards like a cinema film wound the wrong way."

"No, would it?" exclaimed Miss Kohn, rather pleased.

and Mr. Snowden renounce Free Trade, but the second law of
thermo-dynamics will endure while memory holds her seat in this
distracted globe, by which Hamlet meant his head but which I, with a
wider intellectual range, apply to the planet which we have the rapture
of inhabiting. Inspector Umpelty appears shocked, but I assure you that

solve. It reduces it to the complete quintessence of incomprehensible
nonsense. Therefore, by the second law of thermo-dynamics, which lays
down that we are hourly and momently progressing to a state of more and
more randomness, we receive positive assurance that we are moving
happily and securely in the right direction. You may not believe me,"
==> added Wimsey, now merrily launched on a flight of fantasy, "but I have <==
got to the point now at which the slightest glimmer of commonsense
imported into this preposterous case would not merely disconcert me but
cut me to the heart. I have seen unpleasant cases, difficult cases,
complicated cases and even contradictory cases, but a case founded on
stark unreason I have never met before. It is a new experience and,

has been saying, because he's a gentleman that makes up poetry and talks
a bit humorous at times."

Having thus, as he supposed, restored confidence in the mind of Miss
Olga Kohn, the Inspector shepherded his companion away, but it was to

for his hat.

"The policeman doesn't believe a word I've been saying," she whispered
anxiously, "but you do, don't you?"

MONDAY, 29 JUNE

==> Wimsey and the Inspector spent Sunday in Town, and on the Monday started <==
out for Shaftesbury Avenue. At the first two names on their list they
drew blank; either the agent had given out no photographs of Olga Kohn
or he could not remember anything of the circumstances. The third agent,
a Mr. Isaac J. Sullivan, had a smaller and dingier office than the other
two. Its antechamber was thronged with the usual crowd, patiently

or he could not remember anything of the circumstances. The third agent,
a Mr. Isaac J. Sullivan, had a smaller and dingier office than the other
two. Its antechamber was thronged with the usual crowd, patiently
waiting for notice. The Inspector sent in his name by a mournful-eyed
secretary, who looked as though he had spent all his life saying "No" to
==> people and taking the blame for it. Nothing happened. Wimsey seated <==
himself philosophically on the extreme end of a bench already occupied
by eight other people and began to work out a crossword in the morning
paper. The Inspector fidgeted. The secretary, emerging from the inner
door, was promptly besieged by a rush of applicants. He pushed them away
firmly but not harshly, and returned to his desk.

"Sullivan ain't here. Shut that door, will you?"

The Inspector retired, discomfited, amid loud applause from the
ante-room.

==> "I say, old man," said Wimsey, "what do you think the blighter means by <==
this: 'Bright-eyed after swallowing a wingless biped?' Sounds like the
tiger who conveyed the young lady of Riga."

The Inspector snorted.

The Inspector snorted.

There was an interval. Presently the inner door opened again and the
young lady emerged, clothed and apparently very much in her right mind,
for she smiled round and observed to an acquaintance seated next to

"O.K. darling. 'Aeroplane Girl,' first row, song and dance, start next
week."

The acquaintance offered suitable congratulations, the two men with

when anything turns up. Hullo, Phyllis, back again? That's right. Might
want you next week. No, Mammy, no grey-haired mommas wanted to-day.
I--hullo!"

==> His eye fell on Wimsey, who had got stuck over his crossword and was <==
gazing vaguely round in search of inspiration.

"Here, Horrocks! Why the hell didn't you tell me? What do you think I
pay you for? Wasting my time. Here, you, what's your name? Never been
here before, have you? I'm wanting your type. Hi! Rosencrantz!"

speak up, can't you?"

==> "Well, really, don't you know." Wimsey screwed his monocle more firmly <==
into his eye. "Really, old fellow, you make me feel all of a doo-dah,
what?"

"There you are!" said Mr. Sullivan, triumphantly. "Voice like a plum.

"Pretty fair," admitted Mr. Rosencrantz, grudgingly. "Walk a bit, will
you?"

==> Wimsey obliged by mincing delicately in the direction of the inner <==
office. Mr. Sullivan purred after him. Mr. Rosencrantz followed.
Horrocks, aghast, caught Mr. Sullivan by the sleeve.

"I say," he said, "look out. I think there's a mistake."

butting in."

Lord Peter paused in the inner doorway, raking the petrified audience
right and left with impertinent eyes.

"I have played lead," he announced, "before all the crowned heads of

He drew the two stout gentlemen into the room and shut the door behind
them.

waste, eh, Rosencrantz? With your face, you ought to be makin' a

enthusiastic as the desired article was withdrawn from his grasp, "but I
make you a good offer. Vot you say to two hundred a veek, eh?"

"Three hundred?" suggested Mr. Rosencrantz.

are rich, eh? Great pity. It won't last, you know. Super-tax and
death-duties. Better take what you can while you can. No?"

Mr. Rosencrantz sighed.

something for me then, eh?"

that keen on my commission, and if you ask any of the girls they'll tell
you so. What's the matter, eh? Has this Vavasour got her into a hole?"

Vavasour--show Mr. Sullivan that other photograph, Inspector. Is that
the man?"

Mr. Sullivan and Horrocks put their heads together over the photograph

fellow and the other's a bold, bustling sort of chap who chops people's
heads off and flies into tempers. It don't seem to fit, somehow, eh?"

Inspector Umpelty began to scrabble with his feet.

of those men who are always deliberately acting a part--dramatising
things, so to speak. I don't believe his furies are any more real than
his lovemaking. The scene about the strawberries--that's clearly all put

producer or anything genuinely theatrical. These people all know one
another."

Superintendent Glaisher, "that they'll keep an eye on him, we can't
follow him through all the counties in England. We've nothing against
him."

==> Wimsey and the Inspector, returning to Wilvercombe on the Tuesday <==
morning, were greeted with a piece of fresh information.

"We've pulled in Perkins," said Superintendent Glaisher.

It appeared that Mr. Julian Perkins, after leaving Darley and being

P.C. Ormond almost jumped. He was a young man, unmarried and full of
enthusiasms, and he had fallen into a state of worshipping admiration

uncanny skill in prediction. Wimsey had said that the gold would be
found on the body; and lo! it was so. He had said that, as soon as the
inquest had established the time of death, Henry Weldon would turn out
to have an alibi for two o'clock, and here was the alibi arriving as
true to time as moon and tide. He had said that this new alibi would

murder at the Flat-Iron, and it was hardly surprising that no traveller
on the road had seen the bay mare pass. But had she passed? There was
the horseshoe to prove it and there was the ring-bolt on the rock to
suggest it. It was the ring-bolt that was chiefly bothering Constable
Ormond, for if it was not there to hold the horse, what was it for? And
==> Wimsey's latest theory had made it necessary for the horse to be <==
released and sent back before the Flat-Iron was reached.

And that was a very hit-or-miss theory, from the murderer's point of
view. How could he be sure that the animal would go back and would not
hang about the place attracting attention? In fact, after being galloped

Shaking his head, he walked to the edge of the water and set out at a
brisk trot for the Flat-Iron. He found that by pelting along as fast as
a heavyish, fully-clothed young constable could be expected to pelt on a
hot summer's day, he could reach the rock in twelve minutes exactly. It
was too far. Five minutes' walk was the most that Weldon could possibly
==> have allowed himself by Wimsey's calculation. Ormond again scrambled up <==
the cliff, remounted his bicycle and began to do sums in his head.

By the time he arrived at the police-station, these sums had taken a
definite form.

trivial explanation, but not all of them--surely, not all of them. He
had put these points to the Chief Constable, and had received a grudging
kind of permission to go on with his inquiries. But he was not happy.

He wondered what Umpelty was doing. He had heard the story of his
==> excursion to town with Wimsey, and felt that this had only plunged <==
matters into a still deeper obscurity. Then there was the tiresomeness
about Bright. Bright was reported to be working his way towards London.
It was going to be a job keeping an eye on him--especially as Glaisher
was rather hard put to it to find a good reason for the surveillance.
After all, what had Bright done? He was an unsatisfactory character and

thought Glaisher: it was always these meek, mild, timid-looking people
who yearned for revolution and bloodshed. But, taken in connection with
the cipher letters, the matter assumed a certain importance. He wondered
how soon the photographs of the letters found on Alexis would come to

Wimsey was out, and a little further inquiry led Glaisher to Mrs.
Lefranc's, where he found, not only Wimsey, but also Inspector Umpelty,
seated with Harriet in the bed-sitting-room that had once housed Paul
Alexis, all three apparently engaged in a Missing Word Competition.

simpler than that--bigger--not so ramped. Can't you see what I mean?

WEDNESDAY, 1 JULY

The photographs of the paper found on the corpse duly arrived next

in the presence of Glaisher and Umpelty, had to confess that the experts
had made a good job of it. Even the original paper was far more legible
than it had been before. The chemicals that remove bloodstains and the
stains of dyed leather, and the chemicals that restore the lost colour
to washed-out ink had done their work well, and the colour-screens that

     involved the regular substitution of one letter of the alphabet for
     another.

altogether--the kind I was thinking about last night, when we saw those
marked words in the dictionary."

"What kind's that, my lord?"

==> "It's a good code," said Wimsey, "and pretty baffling if you don't know <==
the key-word. It was used during the War. I used it myself, as a matter
of fact, during a brief interval of detecting under a German alias. But
it isn't the exclusive property of the War Office. In fact, I met it not

most frequent letter, because you get a different letter for it each
time, according as it's grouped to the next letter. And you can't guess
individual words, because you don't know where the words begin and end.
Is it at all possible to decode it without the key-word?"

==> "Oh dear, yes," said Wimsey. "Any code ever coded can be decoded with <==
pains and patience--except possibly some of the book codes. I know a man
who spent years doing nothing else. The code diagram got so bitten into
him that when he caught measles he came out in checks instead of spots."

her through it and stirred her up to a canter.

The mare, though willing enough, had, as he expected, no exceptional
turn of speed, and since their progress had to be made actually through
the water, it was a trifle impeded and remarkably noisy. As he rode,
==> Wimsey kept his eye on the cliffs above. Nobody and nothing was in <==
sight, with the exception of a few grazing animals. The road was hidden.
He made good time to the cottages, and then began to look about for
Ormond's break in the cliff. He recognised it when he came to it by the
fallen rocks and the fragments of broken fence above, and looked at his
watch. He was a little ahead of time. Glancing along the shore, he saw

watch. He was a little ahead of time. Glancing along the shore, he saw
the Flat-Iron well in view, with Farmer Newcombe seated upon it, a
little dark lump at a mile's distance. He left the break in the cliff to
be explored on the return journey, and urged the mare to her best pace.
She responded vigorously, and they made the final mile in fine style,
==> the water spraying about them. Wimsey could see the farmer clearly now; <==
he had the white horse tethered to the famous ring-bolt and was standing
on the rock, watch conscientiously in hand, to time them.

It was not till they were within a few score paces of the rock that the
bay mare seemed to realise what was happening. Then she started as if

It was not till they were within a few score paces of the rock that the
bay mare seemed to realise what was happening. Then she started as if
she had been shot, flung up her head and slewed round so violently that

being spun off altogether. He dug his knees into her bare sides and
hauled hard upon the bridle, but, like many farm nags, she had a mouth
of iron, and the snaffle made little impression upon her. She was off,
tearing back in her tracks as if the devil was after her. Wimsey,
cynically telling himself that he had under-estimated her power of

cynically telling himself that he had under-estimated her power of
speed, clung grimly to her withers and concentrated on shortening his
left-hand rein so as to wrench her head round to the sea. Presently,
finding it hard to go forward against this determined drag, she slacked
pace, skirmishing sideways.

with you?"

The mare panted and shuddered.

"But this'll never do," said Wimsey. He stroked her sweaty shoulder

He turned her head once more in the direction of the Flat-Iron, and was
aware of the hurried approach of Mr. Newcombe on the white horse.

"Lord a'mighty," exclaimed Mr. Newcombe, "what's come to the mare? I

thought she'd have you off sure-ly. Done a bit of riding, ain't you?"

there before?"

"Not as I know on," said the farmer.

"You weren't waving your arms or anything, were you?"

"Is she given to shying?"

"Never known her take and do such a thing before."

==> "Queer," said Wimsey. "I'll try her again. Keep behind us, and we'll <==
know it wasn't you that startled her."

He urged the mare back towards the rock at a gentle trot. She moved
forward uneasily, chucking her head about. Then, as before, she stopped
dead and stood trembling.

They tried her half-a-dozen times, cajoling and encouraging her, but to
==> no purpose. She would not go near the Flat-Iron--not even when Wimsey <==
dismounted and led her step by step. She flatly refused to budge,
standing with her shaking legs rooted to the sand, and rolling white and
terrified eyes. Out of sheer mercy for her they had to give up the
attempt.

"I'll be damned," said Mr. Newcombe.

"What can have come over her----" said Mr. Newcombe.

"I know what's come over her all right," said Wimsey, "but---- Well,
never mind, we'd better go back."

They rode slowly homeward. Wimsey did not stay to examine the break in
the cliff. He did not need to. He knew now exactly what had happened
between Darley and the Flat-Iron Rock. As he went, he put the whole

the cliff. He did not need to. He knew now exactly what had happened
between Darley and the Flat-Iron Rock. As he went, he put the whole
elaborate structure of his theories together, line by line, and like
Euclid, wrote at the bottom of it:

always kept five minutes fast, on account of getting the men out legal."

==> Constable Ormond took the blow in silence. Wimsey was wrong; wrong as <==
sin. The two o'clock alibi was proved up to the hilt. Weldon was
innocent; Bright was innocent; Perkins was innocent as day. It now only
remained to prove that the mare was innocent, and the whole

whom he found suffering from nerves and temper.

"Those London fellows have lost Bright," he remarked, curtly. "They
traced him to the _Morning Star_ office, where he drew his reward in the
form of an open cheque. He cashed it at once in currency notes and then

ought to have ridden her did ride her. Are you going to say next that
she cut the bloke's throat with her own shoe and turned herself into a
sea-horse?"

==> Saddened, Wimsey went home to the Bellevue and found a telegram waiting <==
for him. It had been despatched from a West-end office that afternoon,
and ran:

a mite of use saying they didn't. I always did think that lot was in it
up to the eyes. A quiet, private, heart-to-heart murder they might have
overlooked, but a wild horse careering about they couldn't, and there
you are."

==> Wimsey nodded. <==

"I've seen that all along--but how are you going to get it out of them?
Shall I have a go at it, Umpelty? That young fellow, Jem--he doesn't
look as surly as his grandpa--how about him? Has he got any special
interests or hobbies?"

but try. Think one might find him anywhere about this evening? How about
the Three Feathers?"

"If he's not out with his boat, you'd most likely find him there."

==> Wimsey did find him there. It is always reasonably easy to get <==
conversation going in a pub, and it will be a black day for detectives
when beer is abolished. After an hour's entertaining discussion about
football and the chances of various teams in the coming season, Wimsey
found Jem becoming distinctly more approachable. With extreme care and

"Thank'ee, sir. I'd be glad of it."

"And you could show me those photographs you were talking about."

==> The two pushed their way out. Good-nights were exchanged, but Wimsey <==
noticed that none of the Darley inhabitants seemed particularly cordial
to Jem. There was a certain air of constraint about their farewells.

They got into the car, and drove in silence till they were past the
level crossing. Then Jem spoke:

speak, because this here's a hanging matter and there's no call as I see
to get mixed up with it. But Grand-dad, he don't trust that Umpelty and
his lot, and he'd leather the life out of Mother or me if we was to let
on. Once tell the police, he says, and it 'ud be all about the place."

==> "Well--it depends what it is," said Wimsey, a little mystified. <==
"Naturally, the police can't hide anything--well, anything criminal,
but----"

"Oh, 'tis not that, sir. Leastways, not as you might take notice on. But
if they Bainses was to hear tell on it and was to let Gurney know--but

mind if Tom Gurney did play a dirty trick over them there nets."

==> "If it's nothing criminal," said Wimsey, rather relieved, "you may be <==
sure _I_ shan't let anybody know."

"No, sir. That's why I thought I'd like to speak to you, sir. You see,
Grand-dad left a bad impression, the way he wouldn't let on what we was

thought of "doing that Gurney down" and in hearing "that Gurney"
swearing from time to time about the scarcity of lobsters in the bay.
Jem thought the whole thing rather foolish and didn't care for having a
hand in it, because it would have suited his social ambitions better to
keep on good terms with his neighbours, but what with one thing and
==> another (meaning, Wimsey gathered, what with old Pollock's surly temper <==
and the possibility of his leaving his very considerable savings to some
other person, if annoyed), Jem had humoured his grandfather in this
matter of lobster-snatching.

Wimsey was staggered. It was as simple as that, then. All this

==> Wimsey was staggered. It was as simple as that, then. All this <==
mystification, and nothing behind it but a trivial local feud. He
glanced sharply at Jem. It was getting dark, and the young man's face
was nothing but an inscrutable profile.

"Very well, Jem," he said. "I quite see. But now, about this business on

harm,' he says, 'but keep your eyes skinned for the top of the cliffs.'
So I did, and there wasn't a single soul come along that there shore
before we gets to the Grinders, and that's the truth if I was to die for
it."

==> "Now, see here, Jem," said Wimsey. "You heard all the evidence at the <==
inquest, and you know that this poor devil was killed round about two
o'clock."

"That's true, sir; and as sure as I'm sitting here, he must ha' killed
himself, for there was nobody come a-nigh him--barring the young lady,

"Reckon so. No, sir; that poor gentleman made away with himself, there's
no doubt of it. Just cut his throat quiet-like as he sat there. There's
no manner of doubt about that."

==> Wimsey was puzzled. If this was lying, it was done with a surprising <==
appearance of sincerity. But if it was truth, it made the theory of
murder still harder to substantiate than before. Every fragment of
evidence there was pointed to the conclusion that Alexis had died alone
upon his rock and by his own hand.


[line number in individual story] matching line = 13625    window = 13620 13630

murder still harder to substantiate than before. Every fragment of
evidence there was pointed to the conclusion that Alexis had died alone
upon his rock and by his own hand.

And yet--why wouldn't the bay mare go near the Flat-Iron? Was it
==> possible--Wimsey was no friend to superstition, but he had known such <==
things happen before--was it possible that the uneasy spirit of Paul
Alexis still hung about the Flat-Iron, perceptible to the brute though
not to self-conscious man? He had known another horse that refused to
pass the scene of an age-old crime.

"Oh, yes, sir. Mother's sure to be waiting up for me."

"I'd like to see her."

==> Jem offered no objection, and Wimsey went in with him to Pollock's <==
cottage. Mrs. Pollock, stirring soup for Jem in a saucepan, received him
politely, but shook her head at his question.

"No, sir. We heard no horse on the beach this afternoon."


[line number in individual story] matching line = 13645    window = 13640 13650

politely, but shook her head at his question.

"No, sir. We heard no horse on the beach this afternoon."

==> That settled that, then. If Wimsey could ride past the cottages <==
unnoticed, so could any other man.

"The wind's off-shore to-day," added Mrs. Pollock.

"And you're still sure you heard nothing of the sort last Thursday

"Twelve o'clock?"

"Thereabout, sir. It come back to her all of a sudden, when we was
talkin' over what that young Ormond wur askin' about."

==> Wimsey left the cottage with his ideas all in disorder. If someone had <==
been riding on the shore at twelve o'clock, it accounted for the
horseshoe, but it did not account for the murder. Had he, after all,
been quite wrong in attaching so much importance to the horseshoe? Might
not some mischievous lad, finding the bay mare at large, have ridden her
along the beach for a lark? Might she not even have strayed away on her

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 74578    window = 74573 74583


time came to strike the blow? But why? Surely the sole reason for
riding thither could only have been the establishment of an alibi, and
an alibi is thrown away if one lingers for two hours before taking
advantage of it. And how had the mare got home? She was not on the shore
between one o'clock and two o'clock if--again--Jem was to be trusted.
==> Wimsey played for a few moments with the idea of two men riding on one <==
horse--one to do the murder and one to take the animal back, but the
thing seemed far-fetched and absurd.

Then an entirely new thought struck him. In all the discussions about
the crime, it had been taken for granted that Alexis had walked along

He determined to hunt out Inspector Umpelty and face him with these
problems.

The Inspector was just going to bed, and his welcome was not a hearty
==> one, but he showed signs of animation on hearing Wimsey's fresh <==
information.

"Them Pollocks and Moggeridges are the biggest liars in creation," he
observed, "and if there's been murder done, it's good proof that they're
all concerned in it," said he. "But as to how Alexis got there, you can

o'clock and not earlier, and that disposes of number two. Unless, of
course," said the Inspector, slowly, "the real Alexis was up to some
funny business between 10.15 and two o'clock, and this other fellow was
making an alibi for him. I hadn't thought of that."

==> "I suppose," said Wimsey, "that it really _was_ Alexis who was killed. <==
His face was gone, you know, and we've only the clothes and a photograph
to go upon."

"Well, it was somebody else with a real beard, anyhow," said the
Inspector. "And who would Alexis be wanting to kill, do you suppose?"

to go upon."

"Well, it was somebody else with a real beard, anyhow," said the
Inspector. "And who would Alexis be wanting to kill, do you suppose?"

==> "Bolsheviks," suggested Wimsey, lightly. "He might make an appointment <==
with a Bolshevik who meant to murder him, and then murder the
Bolshevik."

"So he might--but that doesn't make things any easier. Whoever it was
did the murder, he had to get away from the Flat-Iron. And how could he

have been hiding under the rock, like you said. The only trouble is, who
was he? It wasn't Weldon, it wasn't Bright, and it wasn't Perkins. But
they're not the only people in the world."

"I'm feeling a bit depressed," he said. "I seem to have fallen down a
bit over this case."

"It's a nuisance," said Umpelty, "but there! We've only been at it a

waste-paper basket, put on his hat and went round to Mrs. Lefranc's.
Here he found Harriet industriously at work upon the cipher. She
reported, however, total failure.

"I don't think it's a scrap of good going on with these marked words,"

this letter, and why wasn't it burnt with the rest?"

"Now you mention it, that is rather odd."

the copy, and the villain said: 'Have you brought the letter?' And
Alexis, without thinking, handed him the copy, and the villain took that
and destroyed that, forgetting that the original might be on the body
too."

==> "You're right," said Wimsey, "you're dead right. That's exactly what <==
must have happened. Well, that's that, but it doesn't get us very much
farther. Still, we've got some idea of what must have been in the
letter, and that will be a great help with the de-coding. We've also got
the idea that the villain may have been a bit of an amateur, and that is
borne out by the letter itself."

in Diagram 1 that washes out the possibility of JMN or JLN for that
line. It would give us JLM, which is impossible unless N is in the
key-word, because N can't come next to E and yet must be in the same
line with it and also with M."

==> Wimsey clawed a little at his hair and sat muttering. <==

"It looks as though we'd sucked our five letters rather dry," said
Harriet. "How about trying the rest of the message? I've got it all
ready sorted out into pairs. Hullo! Here's our old friend EXMG appearing
again in the body of it."

date in June. I can't believe it's part of two words, one of which ends
in J, or I, or JU or IU or IUN or JUN. If the letter was making an
appointment for June 18th, why shouldn't the two letters before it be
the letters for 18, that is AH? We'll try it, anyway; what are they?"

"If so, that's one in the eye for my Socialist friends. I was told only
the other day that Russian Communism was doing itself proud and that the
Russian standard of living, measured in boot-consumption, had risen from
zero to one pair of boots in three years per head of population. Still,

Harriet read on.

     "Bring this paper with you. Silence, secrecy imperative. BORIS."

seem to have got one thing right. I said that the letter would contain
the words: 'Bring this paper with you' and it does. But the rest of it
beats me. 'Pavlo Alexeivitch, heir to the throne of the Romanovs.' Can
your landlady produce anything in the shape of a drink?"

beats me. 'Pavlo Alexeivitch, heir to the throne of the Romanovs.' Can
your landlady produce anything in the shape of a drink?"

==> After an interval for refreshment, Wimsey hitched his chair closer to <==
the table and sat staring at the decoded message.

"Now," he said, "let's get this straight. One thing is certain. This is
the letter that brought Paul Alexis to the Flat-Iron. Boris sent it,
whoever he is. Now, is Boris a friend or an enemy?"

Darley on the Tuesday, and all this business was planned long before
that, as the date of the letter shows. Possibly whoever it was was
horrified to find Weldon encamped in Hinks's Lane and frightfully
relieved to see him barge off on the Thursday morning."

==> Wimsey shook his head. <==

"Talk about coincidence! Well, maybe so. Now let's go on and see what
happened. The Rider made the appointment with Alexis, who would get to
the Flat-Iron about 11.45. The Rider met him there, and gave him his
instructions--verbally, we may suppose. He then rode back to Darley,

Harriet, hopefully, "it needn't be a Bolshevik. It might be somebody
with a private motive for doing away with Alexis. How about the da Soto
gentleman who got the reversion of Leila Garland? Leila may have told
him some nasty story about Alexis."

==> Wimsey was silent; his thoughts seemed to be wandering. Presently he <==
said:

"Yes. Only we happen to know that da Soto was playing at the Winter
Gardens all that time. But now I want to look at the thing from a quite
different point of view. What about this letter? Is it genuine? It's

"I'll tell you what it does look like," said Harriet. "It's like the
kind of thing I should put into a detective story if I didn't know a
thing about Russia and didn't care much, and only wanted to give a
general idea that somebody was a conspirator."

==> "That's it!" said Wimsey. "You're absolutely right. It might have come <==
straight out of one of those Ruritanian romances that Alexis was so fond
of."

"Of course--and now we know why he was fond of them. No wonder! They
were all part of the mania. I suppose we ought to have guessed all

isn't any note in any of Alexis' books anywhere, is there?--that would
tell us who he imagined he might have been."

"Not a thing."

==> Wimsey gathered up the papers from the table and rose to his feet. <==

"I shall hand these over to Glaisher," he said. "They will give him
something to think about. I like to see other people doing a spot of
work from time to time. Do you realise that it's nearly tea-time and we
haven't had any lunch?"

haven't had any lunch?"

"Time passes when one is pleasantly occupied," said Harriet,
sententiously.

==> Wimsey put his hat and papers down on the table, opened his mouth to <==
speak, changed his mind, took up his belongings again and marched to the
door.

"Cheerio!" he said, amiably.

She must have felt strongly about it, for she repeated the remark
several times.

==> Wimsey absorbed an anomalous meal in the Grill Room, went round to the <==
police-station, handed the decoded letter to the Superintendent, whom it
surprised very much, and then ran his car out to Darley. He was still
worried by the coincidence about Weldon and his absence from Hinks's
Lane during the crucial period. He approached Mr. Polwhistle.

see?--what were giving an intermittent short the day before when Mr.
Martin complained of bad running and starting, and somehow or other the
wires might ha' got fused together, and that made a dead short on the
Thursday."

==> "Very likely," said Wimsey. "Did you actually examine the leads <==
afterwards?"

Tom scratched his head.

"Now you ask me," he said, "I don't rightly know what happened to them

"Nothing easier," said Mr. Polwhistle, producing a small tool-bag and
routing among a quantity of miscellaneous odds and ends. "Nothing
easier, and here they do be, which just shows you what it is to be a
tidy-minded man."

==> Wimsey took the pair of leads from his hands. <==

"H'm--yes--they seem to be fused together just where they pass under the
clip." He jerked the wires apart. "Nothing wrong with the insulation,
though, apparently. Hullo! hullo!"

Mr. Polwhistle also ran his finger along and then withdrew it with a
hasty exclamation.

"That's pretty sharp," he muttered. "What is it?"

==> "I suggest that it's the business end of a sewing-needle," said Wimsey. <==
"Give us a sharp pen-knife, and we'll soon see."

When the insulation was opened up the cause of the short-circuit was
abundantly plain. A needle had been passed through the lead and broken
off short, so as to leave no visible trace of its presence. When the two

"Well, there now!" said Mr. Polwhistle. "To think of that! That's a
nice, dirty trick to play on a gentleman. Who could a-done it beats me.
How was it you missed seeing them two leads skewered together that way,
Tom?"

==> "Nobody could possibly see it when it was in place," said Wimsey. "It <==
would be pushed up under the clip."

"And Mr. Martin jerking the leads out that sudden," put in Tom, "It
stands to reason I couldn't a-seen it. Of course, if I'd had 'em in my
hands afterwards--"

Somebody who didn't want Mr. Martin to go to Wilvercombe that morning."

"I see, my lord. Very good. We won't say a word. But that's a queer
thing, none the more for that."

==> "It is," said Wimsey, "very queer." <==

       *       *       *       *       *

It was rather queerer than Mr. Polwhistle quite realised, though a
peculiar glint in Tom's eye suggested that he at least was beginning to

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 75636    window = 75631 75641


peculiar glint in Tom's eye suggested that he at least was beginning to
appreciate its full oddity. A needle thrust through the H.T. leads of a
two-cylinder car does not produce intermittent firing or erratic
running: it stops the ignition dead. Yet on the Wednesday, Mr. Martin's
Morgan had been running (though not well) up to the moment of his return
==> to Hinks's Lane. And to Wimsey, who knew that Martin was Weldon, the <==
whole thing seemed doubly inexplicable. Why had Weldon gone out of his
way to hire a Morgan for his little trip when, with a tent and luggage
to carry, he would surely have found a larger vehicle more convenient?
Was it another coincidence that he should have particularly asked for a
two-cylinder vehicle, which could be put completely out of action with

hair and dark spectacles to carry on a bit of detective work on his own,
had contrived to involve himself in a tangle of coincidence and
conjecture which looked almost like the work of a malignant and
interfering demon.

==> Another thing seemed certain, too: that every theory Wimsey had so far <==
formed about the case was utterly and madly wide of the mark.

bearded man. He passed Bunter with a muttered apology and went on up the
gangway. Bunter proceeded on his way down but, by some instinct, turned
at the curtained door and looked back.

He saw the back of the bearded man, outlined against the sudden blue
==> daylight, passing through an exit, and remembered how Wimsey had once <==
said to him: "Any fool can disguise his face, but it takes a genius to
disguise a back." He had not followed that back through London for five
days without knowing every line of it. In a moment he was hurrying up
the gangway and out through the exit. Beard or no beard, this was his
man.

"I look at it this way," said Superintendent Glaisher. "If this here
Bright is Morecambe, and Mrs. Morecambe is in cahoots with Weldon, then,
likewise, Weldon and Bright--so to call him--are in cahoots together."

==> "Undoubtedly," said Wimsey, "but if you think that this identification <==
is going to make life one grand, sweet song for you, you are mistaken.
All it has done so far is to bust up every conclusion we have so far
come to."

"Yes, my lord; undoubtedly the thing still has a hitch in it. Still,

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 76011    window = 76006 76016


Morecambe, he isn't a hairdresser; therefore he had no legitimate call
to buy that razor; therefore his tale about the razor is all eyewash,
like we always thought it was; therefore, humanly speaking there's not
much doubt that Paul Alexis didn't commit suicide, but was murdered."

==> "Exactly," said Wimsey, "and since we have devoted a great deal of time <==
and thought to the case on the assumption that it was a murder, it's a
convenience to know that the assumption is probably correct."

"So it is. Well, now, if Weldon and Morecambe are both in this together,
it's likely that the motive for the murder is what we thought--getting

"So it is. Well, now, if Weldon and Morecambe are both in this together,
it's likely that the motive for the murder is what we thought--getting
hold of Mrs. W.'s money--or isn't it?"

"Then what's all this Bolshevik business got to do with it?" demanded
Inspector Umpelty.

"It's likely," agreed Wimsey.

"Then what's all this Bolshevik business got to do with it?" demanded
Inspector Umpelty.

==> "Lots," said Wimsey. "Look here; I'm going to offer you two more <==
identifications. First of all, I suggest that Morecambe was the bearded
friend who came to stay with Weldon at Fourways Farm at the end of
February. And secondly, I suggest that Morecambe was the bearded
gentleman who approached Mr. Sullivan of Wardour Street and asked him
for the photograph of a Russian-looking girl. It is interesting that Mr.

"Of course, that's plain enough, now we know about the beard," said
Glaisher. "But why the photograph?"

"Let's try and put the story together in the right order, as far as
==> we've got it," suggested Wimsey. "First of all, here is Weldon, over <==
head and ears in debt, and raising money against his expectations from
his mother. Very well. Now, early this year, Mrs. Weldon comes to
Wilvercombe, and begins to take a great deal of interest in Paul Alexis.
In February, she definitely announces that she means to marry Alexis,
and possibly she is foolish enough to admit that, if she does marry him,

way for Morecambe would have been to get Alexis to break off with Mrs.
Weldon on the grounds that he had to go to Russia and be a Tsar. Surely
that would have attained the object of the plot without bumping off the
poor little blighter."

==> "Well, would it?" said Wimsey. "In the first place, I rather imagine <==
that Mrs. Weldon's romantic reaction to a notion of that kind would have
been to hand over large sums of money to Alexis for the Imperial
war-chest, which would hardly have suited Messrs. Weldon and Morecambe.
Secondly, if Alexis did break off the engagement and they trusted to
that--what would happen next? They couldn't go on for the remainder of

"Sounds as though young Alexis was a bit of a blackguard," said
Inspector Umpelty. "First, he chucks his girl. Secondly, he leads poor
old Mrs. Weldon up the garden, by pretending to go on with an engagement
he doesn't mean to carry out."

==> "No," said Wimsey. "You don't allow for the Imperial outlook. A prince <==
in exile may form irregular attachments, but, when the call comes to him
to take up his imperial station, all personal ties must be sacrificed to
his public duty. A mere kept woman, like Leila, can be simply dismissed
or handed over to somebody else. A person to whom he is bound by more
honourable ties will also have to be sacrificed, but with more ceremony.

her according to his own lights, which were probably--well, continental.
He would have been a charming husband to her and kept a mistress in a
discreet and decent manner."

Inspector Umpelty seemed disposed to quarrel with the term "decent," but
==> Wimsey hurried on with his argument. <==

"I fancy, too, that Alexis may have shown a little reluctance to take
this course with Leila and Mrs. Weldon. He may have been really fond of
Leila; or he may have felt uncomfortable about letting Mrs. Weldon down.
So that was why they invented Feodora."

whole pathetic illusion, but these things serve their purpose, Glaisher,
they serve their purpose. My God, Glaisher--when you think of that poor
silly devil, going to his death on a lonely rock, with his brain
spinning with the idea of being crowned Emperor----"

==> Wimsey broke off, shaken by an unwonted vehemence of feeling. The two <==
policemen shuffled their feet sympathetically.

"Well, it does seem a shame, my lord, and that's a fact," said Glaisher.
"Let's hope he died quick, without knowing any better."

lamplight. They picked them up and weighed them in their palms; they
held them between their fingers, passing inquisitive fingers along the
milled edges and over the smooth relief of the gleaming George and
Dragon.

they're actually worth nothing, because, being a tom-fool, I can't bring
myself to spend them. But they're gold. I wouldn't mind possessing £300
worth of them, though they might weigh five pounds avoirdupois and be an
infernal nuisance. But the queer thing is this--that that extra five

She had joined the committee-meeting half-way through the session, and
had been sitting quietly in an armchair, smoking, with her hat on her
knee.

==> "Yes, do we?" said Wimsey. "We thought we did when Mrs. Morecambe was <==
supposed to be an unimpeachable witness, but do we now? I think I see a
gleam in Miss Vane's eye that suggests she is about to put one over on
us. Speak. I am bound to hear! What has Robert Templeton been
discovering?"

him with what we know about Morecambe and the letter and all that, he
may come clean. If he was along there at 12.15, he must have seen
Alexis, anyhow."

==> Wimsey shook his head. <==

"Deep waters," he said, "deep waters. Look here! I've an idea we've been
working this thing from the wrong end. If only we knew more about those
papers that Alexis sent to 'Boris,' they might tell us something. Where
do you suppose they are? You may say, in Warsaw--but I don't think so. I

Morecambe to himself, the more time he's got to make away with the
evidence. It may be you're right, my lord, and we ought to pull him in.
Only you'll bear in mind, my lord, that if we do detain him, we'll have
to make a charge. There's such a thing as Habeas Corpus."

==> "All the same," said Wimsey, "I think you'll have to risk that. I don't <==
suppose you'll find any papers, but you may find something else. The
paper and ink used to write the letters, perhaps, and books of reference
about Russia. Books aren't as easy to get rid of as papers. And we've
got to find out the exact connection between Morecambe and Weldon."

"Oh yeah?" Harriet grinned impishly. "When Lord Peter gets these fits of

MONDAY, 6 JULY

==> The conquest of Leila Garland followed the usual course. Wimsey pursued <==
her into a tea-shop, cut her out neatly from the two girl-friends who
accompanied her, fed her, took her to the pictures and carried her off
to the Bellevue for a cocktail.

The young lady showed an almost puritanical discretion in clinging to

her into a tea-shop, cut her out neatly from the two girl-friends who
accompanied her, fed her, took her to the pictures and carried her off
to the Bellevue for a cocktail.

The young lady showed an almost puritanical discretion in clinging to
==> the public rooms of that handsome hotel, and drove Wimsey almost to <==
madness by the refinement of her table-manners. Eventually, however, he
manœuvred her into an angle of the lounge behind a palm-tree, where they
could not be overlooked and where they were far enough from the
orchestra to hear each other speak. The orchestra was one of the more
infuriating features of the Bellevue, and kept up an incessant drivel of

dance-tunes from four in the afternoon till ten at night. Miss Garland
awarded it a moderate approval, but indicated that it did not quite
reach the standard of the orchestra in which Mr. da Soto played a
leading part.

==> Wimsey gently led the conversation to the distressing publicity which <==
Miss Garland had been obliged to endure in connection with the death of
Alexis. Miss Garland agreed that it had not been nice at all. Mr. da
Soto had been very much upset. A gentleman did not like his girl-friend
to have to undergo so much unpleasant questioning.

Alexis. Miss Garland agreed that it had not been nice at all. Mr. da
Soto had been very much upset. A gentleman did not like his girl-friend
to have to undergo so much unpleasant questioning.

==> Lord Peter Wimsey commended Miss Garland on the discretion she had shown <==
throughout.

Of course, said Leila, Mr. Alexis was a dear boy, and always a perfect
gentleman. And most devoted to her. But hardly a manly man. A girl could
not help preferring manly men, who had _done_ something. Girls were like

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 76534    window = 76529 76539


to do anything, he might still _do_ things, might he not? (Languishing
glance at Lord Peter.) That was the kind of man Miss Garland liked. It
was, she thought, much finer to be a nobly-born person who _did_ things
than a nobly-born person who only _talked_ about nobility.

==> "But was Alexis nobly born?" inquired Wimsey. <==

"Well, he _said_ he was--but how is a girl to know? I mean, it's easy to
talk, isn't it? Paul--that is, Mr. Alexis--used to tell wonderful
stories about himself, but it's _my_ belief he was making it all up. He
was such a boy for romances and story-books. But I said to him, 'What's

about. It doesn't sound very respectable to me,' I said, 'and if
princesses with plenty of money can't keep respectable,' I said, 'I
don't see why anybody should put any blame on girls who have to earn
their own living.' That's what I told him."

==> "Very true indeed," said Wimsey. "He must have had a bit of a mania <==
about it."

"Loopy," said Miss Garland, allowing the garment of refinement to slip
aside for a moment. "I mean to say, I think he must have been a little
silly about it, don't you?"

'Do you think I keep every bit of your handwriting?' I said, 'like the
heroines in story-books?' I said. 'Because,' I said, 'let me tell you I
don't,' I said. 'Anything that's _worth_ keeping, I'll keep, but not
rubbishing bits of paper.'"

==> Wimsey remembered that Alexis had offended Leila towards the end of <==
their connection by a certain lack of generosity.

"'If you want things kept,' I said, 'why don't you give them to that old
woman that's so struck on you?' I said. 'If you're going to marry her,'
I said, 'she's the right person to give things to,' I said, 'if you want

"And _had_ you burnt the paper?"

"Why, I'm sure I don't know. You're nearly as bad as he is, going on
about the paper. What does the stupid paper matter, anyhow?"

==> "Well," said Wimsey, "I'm inquisitive about papers. Still, if you've <==
burnt it, you've burnt it. It's a pity. If you could have found that
paper, it might be worth----"

The beautiful eyes of Leila directed their beams upon him like a pair of
swivelling head-lamps rounding a corner on a murky night.

"Yes?" breathed Leila.

==> "It might be worth having a look at," replied Wimsey, coolly. "Perhaps <==
if you had a hunt among your odds-and-ends, you know--"

Leila shrugged her shoulders. This sounded troublesome.

"I can't see what you want that old bit of paper for."

He smiled. Leila smiled. She felt she had grasped the idea.

"What? You and me? Oh, _well_!--but I don't see that I could exactly
take you round to my place, _could_ I? I mean to say----"

==> "Oh, that'll be all right," said Wimsey, swiftly. "You're surely not <==
afraid of _me_. You see, I'm trying to _do_ something, and I want your
help."

"I'm sure, anything I can do--provided it's nothing Mr. da Soto would
object to. He's a terribly jealous boy, you know."

Drawers, bags, boxes, overflowing with intimate and multifarious litter
which piled itself on the bed, streamed over the chairs and swirled
ankle-deep upon the floor! Left to herself, Leila would have wearied of

Soto, arriving suddenly to find Wimsey holding an armful of lingerie,
while Leila ferreted among a pile of crumpled bills and picture
postcards which had been bundled into the bottom of a trunk, thought the
scene was set for a little genteel blackmail and started to bluster.

it in one of those story-books you're always reading, same like you
always do with your 'bus-tickets."

==> "That's an idea," said Wimsey, eagerly. <==

They turned their attention to a shelf stacked with cheap fiction and
penny novelettes. The volumes yielded quite a surprising collection, not
only of 'bus-tickets, but also of cinema-ticket counterfoils, bills,
chocolate-papers, envelopes, picture-cards, cigarette-cards and other

me. _I_ never could make head or tail of it, but if it's any good to
you, you're welcome to it."

==> Wimsey cast a rapid glance at the spidery lines of the family tree which <==
sprawled from top to bottom of the sheet.

"So that's who he thought he was. Yes--I'm glad you didn't chuck this
away, Miss Garland. It may clear things up quite a lot."

isn't it? Umpelty might run you in for suppressing important evidence."
He grinned in da Solo's baffled face. "But I won't say--seeing that Miss
Garland has turned her place upside-down to oblige me--that she mightn't
get a new frock out of it if she's a good girl. Now, listen to me, my
child. When did you say Alexis gave you this?"

widow several times over--Charlotte, I mean. She married some Count or
other or General Somebody--I forget--and had something to do with
politics."

can see Charlotte all right, playing her cards carefully among the new
nobility. Well, this elderly beauty marries, or doesn't marry, the young
Tsar and produces a daughter and calls her Nicolaevna after her
illustrious papa. Being in France, they call the child Nicole. What

"How you do go on!" said Miss Garland, impatiently. "It doesn't sound a

those books he was so fond of."

story. Colourful, vivid stuff, with costume effects and plenty of human
interest. And it fits in reasonably well from the historical point of
view. You're quite sure you heard all about it in November?"

Leila Garland yawned dreadfully.

speculations. "And she married another Russian. Presumably they are
living in Russia again now. Mélanie is the daughter's name, and the
husband is Alexis Gregorovitch, and they are the parents of Paul Alexis,

it. "Even if Alexis' great-great-grandmother had been married to

struck. We've got all the evidence--at least, not all, but overwhelming
evidence--of an elaborate conspiracy to do something or the other. And
we've got a corpse which looks like the victim of a conspiracy to

people, and that thins the suspects out a bit and you spot who it is."

blood in his veins instead of only two or three, it wouldn't help us to
explain how he managed to get killed with nobody near him. The real

true that the murderers later on found themselves faced with an
unexpected alteration in the time-scheme, but just for the moment we'll
work out the time-scheme as it originally stood. Do you mind? I want
to."

thinking hard. Then he spoke, without any trace of his former
excitement.

Morecambe goes to Leamhurst and stays a few days with Weldon. All
through this business, Morecambe has been far too smart to put anything
on paper, except all that rubbish in cipher, so I imagine the plot was
more or less worked out then. Weldon mentions to Morecambe the romantic
tale of Alexis' Imperial descent, and that gives them the idea for

Morecambe was the source of information about the topography and fauna
of Wilvercombe and Darley. Weldon was chosen to do the throat-cutting
and horse-riding part of it, which needed brawn only, while Morecambe
buzzed about despatching letters and photographs and working Alexis up

about? It seems silly of him to scatter oats all over the place like
that."

the oats he scattered were from the day before, when he first started to
make friends with the mare. Teach an animal to come for food once and
it'll come twice as fast the second time; but once disappoint it, and it

hero left most of his clothes behind him. I'm not certain, but it seems
an obvious precaution. At any rate, he bridled the mare and mounted her
and rode off. You've got to remember that between Darley and Pollock's
cottage the shore is hidden from the road, so that the only risk he ran
of being seen was by somebody straying on the edge of the cliff itself.

before low tide and that there is a foot and a half of water at the foot
of the Flat-Iron. He ties the mare close by the head to the ring-bolt
put there the day before, and he climbs up on to the rock. Alexis may or
may not have recognised him. If he did..."

==> Wimsey paused, and his eyes grew angry. <==

"Whether he did or not, he hadn't much time for disappointment. Weldon
asked him to sit down, I think; emperors sit, while respectful commoners
stand behind them, you see. Weldon asked for the letter, and Alexis gave
him the decoded translation. Then he leaned over him from behind with

"Ghosts," replied Inspector Umpelty, with a snort of incredulity.
"Anyhow, you can't put horses in the witness-box."

"Weldon made a mistake afterwards in coming to Wilvercombe," went on
==> Wimsey. "With that identification mark on his arm, he should have kept <==
away, mother or no mother. But he _had_ to poke his nose in and see what
was happening. And Morecambe--well, his possible appearance as a witness
was foreseen, of course. I wonder, though, if he was really wise to
answer that advertisement of ours. I suppose it was the best thing he
could do--but he ought to have smelt the trap, I think. But my private

case against them for conspiring to procure by menaces or something. If
some accomplice of theirs killed him, we've got to find that accomplice.
In either case, I mustn't waste any more time about it. I only wish I'd
never touched the bleeding case."

==> "But you're so hasty, Inspector," bleated Wimsey. "I only said the plan <==
went wrong; I never said they didn't carry it out."

Inspector Umpelty looked sadly at Wimsey, and his lips silently formed
the word "loopy." But aloud he merely observed:

"Well, my lord, whatever they did, they didn't murder Alexis at two
o'clock, because they weren't there to do it; and they didn't murder him
at twelve o'clock, because he didn't die till two. Those are facts,

"Right through."

"Then how is it he didn't die till two o'clock?"

died."

WEDNESDAY, 8 JULY

"Do you mean to say," demanded Inspector Umpelty, with slow indignation,
"that the young lady finds herself mistaken all this time?"

==> Harriet shook her head, and Wimsey said, "No." <==

"Well, my lord, I don't think you can go against the doctor. I've asked
other doctors about it, and they say there's no doubt about it."

"You didn't tell them the whole of the facts," said Wimsey. "I don't

Harriet shook her head, and Wimsey said, "No."

other doctors about it, and they say there's no doubt about it."

==> "You didn't tell them the whole of the facts," said Wimsey. "I don't <==
blame you," he added, kindly, "I've only just thought of the rest of the
facts myself. Something you said about blood put it in my head, Harriet.
Suppose we put down a few things we know about this supposed heir of the
Romanovs."

"Don't tease him, Peter. Try the initial letters, Mr. Umpelty."

"Ah--oh! You _will_ have your fun, my lord! H, A, E--Hæmophilia. What in
the name of blazes is that, when it's at home?"

==> "It's a condition of the blood," said Wimsey, "due to a lack of <==
something-or-the-other, calcium or what not. It is inherited, like
colour-blindness, through the female, and shows itself only, or
practically only, in the male, and then only in alternate generations.
That is to say, it might lie hidden in generation after generation of
daughters, and then, by some malignant chance, pop suddenly up in a son

"I don't know that I see it now," said the Inspector, "except that it
explains why Alexis was such a namby-pamby and all that. Do you mean it
proves that Alexis really was a royalty of sorts and that the
Bolshies----?"

==> "It may or may not prove any of that," said Wimsey. "But don't you see, <==
my dear old goat, that it completely busts up and spifflicates the
medical evidence? We timed the death for two o'clock because the blood
hadn't clotted--but if Alexis was a hæmophilic, you might wait till
Kingdom Come, and his blood would never clot at all. Therefore, he may
have died at noon or dawn for all we know. As a matter of fact, the

"Yes--but----" the Inspector seemed worried. "That's all right for us,
but I mean to say, that doesn't prove it was a murder--I mean, you've
got to prove it was a murder first, before you prove anything else. I
mean to say----"

==> "Quite right," said Wimsey. "Unlike Mr. Weldon, you can spot the <==
_petitio elenchi_. But look here, if Alexis was seen alive on the road
between half-past ten and half-past eleven and was dead at two o'clock,
then he must have died during the period covered by the alibis; that's
certain. And I think we can get it down a bit closer. Jem Pollock and
his granddad puzzled us by saying that they thought they saw the man

'bleeder.' No, poor devil, he must have been terrified the whole time
for fear they should find it out."

"Yes, I see. It's natural, when you come to think of it."

==> "If you exhume the body," said Wimsey, "you will very likely find the <==
characteristic thickening of the joints that accompanies hæmophilia. And
I daresay you might get conclusive evidence by inquiring among the
people who knew Alexis in London and America. I'm pretty sure he had the
disease."

There was silence after the Inspector left them.

"Well!" said Harriet at last.

==> "Well," said Wimsey, "isn't that a damned awful, bitter, bloody farce? <==
The old fool who wanted a lover and the young fool who wanted an empire.
One throat cut and three people hanged, and £130,000 going begging for
the next man who likes to sell his body and soul for it. God! What a
jape! King Death has asses' ears with a vengeance."

see Antoine. It's all frightening and disgusting. We'll go home."

"Right-ho! We'll go home. We'll dine in Piccadilly. Damn it," said

were likely to remain on the open shore after nearly a week of
exceptionally high tides. She admitted however, that she needed exercise

Now, at the Corner House there are three large floors, and each large
floor has two doorways. Yet to get into the same lift as Bright was to

to the centre counter and stood, apparently inspecting the array of
cakes and sweetmeats, but in reality keeping a sharp look-out on all the
lift-doors and the two marble staircases. After ten minutes he felt that
he might assume Bright's purpose to be genuinely that of getting

that it was bearing Bright away with it. No matter, the die was cast
now. He pushed open the swing door on the first floor and began his slow
stroll among the crowded tables.

The sight of bewildered customers looking for a seat is no unusual one

made the circuit of the big room and satisfied himself that Bright was
not among those present. He went out by the farther door, where he was
challenged by the inquiry whether he had been served. He replied that he
was looking for a friend and ran on up to the second floor.

This room was the exact twin of the first, except that, instead of a
male orchestra in evening dress playing _My Canary has Circles under His

until--his staid heart giving a sudden leap beneath the deplorable blue
serge waistcoat--he caught sight of a familiar sandy head and crooked
pair of shoulders. Bright was there, seated at a table containing three
elderly women, and peacefully eating a grilled chop.

Work she had in abundance. To be tried for murder is a fairly good

were booming. She had signed up sensational contracts in both
continents, and found herself, consequently, a very much richer woman
than she had ever dreamed of becoming. In the interval between finishing

started off on a solitary walking-tour: plenty of exercise, no

seaward horizon. Except for an occasional tradesman's van, or a
dilapidated Morris, and the intermittent appearance of white smoke from
a distant railway-engine, the landscape was as rural and solitary as it
might have been two hundred years before.

dark, slight, with a skin naturally a little sallow, but now tanned to
an agreeable biscuit-colour by sun and wind. Persons of this fortunate

dressed sensibly in a short skirt and thin sweater and carried, in

addition to a change of linen and an extra provision of footwear, little
else beyond a pocket edition of _Tristram Shandy_, a vest-pocket camera,
a small first-aid outfit and a sandwich lunch.

It was about a quarter to one when the matter of the lunch began to loom
==> up importantly in Harriet's mind. She had come about eight miles on her <==
way to Wilvercombe, having taken things easily and made a detour to
inspect certain Roman remains declared by the guide-book to be "of
considerable interest." She began to feel both weary and hungry, and
looked about her for a suitable lunching-place.

which to sit. She selected the cosiest spot, drew out her lunch and
_Tristram Shandy_, and settled down.

There is no more powerful lure to slumber than hot sunshine on a
sea-beach after lunch; nor is the pace of _Tristram Shandy_ so swift as
==> to keep the faculties working at high pressure. Harriet found the book <==
escaping from her fingers. Twice she caught it back with a jerk; the
third time it eluded her altogether. Her head drooped over at an
unbecoming angle. She dozed off.

She was awakened suddenly by what seemed to be a shout or cry almost in

There is something about virgin sand which arouses all the worst
instincts of the detective-story writer. One feels an irresistible
impulse to go and make footprints all over it. The excuse which the
professional mind makes to itself is that the sand affords a grand
==> opportunity for observation and experiment. Harriet was no stranger to <==
this impulse. She determined to walk out across that tempting strip of
sand. She gathered her various belongings together and started off
across the loose shingle, observing, as she had often observed before,
that footsteps left no distinguishable traces in the arid region above
high-water mark.

[line number in individual story] matching line = 131    window = 126 136

high-water mark.

Soon, a little belt of broken shells and half-dry seaweed showed that
the tide-mark had been reached.

==> "I wonder," said Harriet to herself, "whether I ought to be able to <==
deduce something or other about the state of the tides. Let me see. When
the tide is at neaps, it doesn't rise or fall so far as when it is at
springs. Therefore, if that is the case, there ought to be two seaweedy
marks--one quite dry and farther in, showing the highest point of spring
tides, and one damper and farther down, showing to-day's best effort."

rock, standing down at the sea's edge, on the other side of the point.
It was roughly triangular in shape, standing about ten feet out of the
water, and seemed to be crowned with a curious lump of black seaweed.

A solitary rock is always attractive. All right-minded people feel an
==> overwhelming desire to scale and sit upon it. Harriet made for it <==
without any mental argument, trying to draw a few deductions as she
went.

"Is that rock covered at high tide? Yes, of course, or it wouldn't have
seaweed on top. Besides, the slope of the shore proves it. I wish I was

She was within a few yards of the rock now, gazing up at the sleeper. He
lay uncomfortably bunched up on the extreme seaward edge of the rock,
his knees drawn high and showing his pale mauve socks. The head, tucked
closely down between the shoulders, was invisible.

==> "What a way to sleep," said Harriet. "More like a cat than a human <==
being. It's not natural. His head must be almost hanging over the edge.
It's enough to give him apoplexy. Now, if I had any luck, he'd be a
corpse, and I should report him and get my name in the papers. That
would be something like publicity. 'Well-known Woman Detective-Writer
Finds Mystery Corpse on Lonely Shore.' But these things never happen to

authors. It's always some placid labourer or night-watchman who finds
corpses...."

The rock lay tilted like a gigantic wedge of cake, its base standing
steeply up to seaward, its surface sloping gently back to where its apex
==> entered the sand. Harriet climbed up over its smooth, dry surface till <==
she stood almost directly over the man. He did not move at all.
Something impelled her to address him.

"Oy!" she said, protestingly.

"Oy!" she said, protestingly.

There was neither movement nor reply.

==> "I'd just as soon he didn't wake up," thought Harriet. "I can't imagine <==
what I'm shouting for. _Oy!_"

"Perhaps he's in a fit or a faint," she said to herself. "Or he's got
sunstroke. That's quite likely. It's very hot." She looked up, blinking,
at the brazen sky, then stooped and laid one hand on the surface of the

"Are you all right?"

The man said nothing and she pulled upon the shoulder. It shifted
slightly--a dead weight. She bent over and gently lifted the man's head.

==> Harriet's luck was in. <==

It _was_ a corpse. Not the sort of corpse there could be any doubt
about, either. Mr. Samuel Weare of Lyons Inn, whose "throat they cut
from ear to ear," could not have been more indubitably a corpse. Indeed,
if the head did not come off in Harriet's hands, it was only because the

into a little hollow below.

==> Harriet put the head down again and felt suddenly sick. She had written <==
often enough about this kind of corpse, but meeting the thing in the
flesh was quite different. She had not realised how butchery the severed
vessels would look, and she had not reckoned with the horrid halitus of
blood, which streamed to her nostrils under the blazing sun. Her hands
were red and wet. She looked down at her dress. That had escaped, thank

over again, drying them with ridiculous care upon her handkerchief. She
did not like the look of the red trickle that dripped down the face of
the rock into the clear water. Retreating, she sat down rather hastily
on some loose boulders.

==> "A dead body," said Harriet, aloud to the sun and the seagulls. "A dead <==
body. How--how appropriate!" She laughed.

"The great thing," Harriet found herself saying, after a pause, "the
great thing is to keep cool. Keep your head, my girl. What would Lord
Peter Wimsey do in such a case? Or, of course, Robert Templeton?"

[line number in individual story] matching line = 270    window = 265 275

notorious for the sang-froid with which he examined bodies of the most
repulsive description. Bodies reduced to boneless jelly by falling from
aeroplanes; bodies charred into "unrecognisable lumps" by fire; bodies
run over by heavy vehicles, and needing to be scraped from the road with
shovels--Robert Templeton was accustomed to examine them all, without
==> turning a hair. Harriet felt that she had never fully appreciated the <==
superb nonchalance of her literary offspring.

Of course, any ordinary person, who was not a Robert Templeton, would
leave the body alone and run for the police. But there were no police.
There was not a man, woman or child within sight; only a small

superb nonchalance of her literary offspring.

Of course, any ordinary person, who was not a Robert Templeton, would
leave the body alone and run for the police. But there were no police.
There was not a man, woman or child within sight; only a small

wildly in its direction, but its occupants either did not see her or
supposed that she was merely doing some kind of reducing exercise.
Probably their own sail cut off their view of the shore, for they were
tacking up into the wind, with the vessel lying well over. Harriet
shouted, but her voice was lost amid the crying of the gulls.

As she stood, hopelessly calling, she felt a wet touch on her foot. The
tide had undoubtedly turned, and was coming in fast. Quite suddenly,
this fact registered itself in her mind and seemed to clear her brain

[line number in individual story] matching line = 350    window = 345 355

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 61246    window = 61241 61251


From the face she passed on to the hands, and here she was again
surprised. Robert Templeton or no Robert Templeton, she had taken for
granted that this elegantly-dressed youth had come to this incongruous
and solitary spot to commit suicide. That being so, it was surely odd
that he should be wearing gloves. He had lain doubled up with his arms
==> beneath him, and the gloves were very much stained. Harriet began to <==
draw off one of them, but was overcome by the old feeling of distaste.
She saw that they were loose chamois gloves of good quality, suitable to
the rest of the costume.

Suicide--with gloves on? Why had she been so certain that it was

[line number in individual story] matching line = 372    window = 367 377

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 61268    window = 61263 61273


had he been dead? The tide had only turned recently, and there were no
keelmarks on the sand. No one, surely, would have climbed the seaward
face of the rock. How long was it since there had been a sufficient
depth of water to bring a boat within easy reach of the body?

==> Harriet wished she knew more about times and tides. If Robert Templeton <==
had happened, in the course of his brilliant career, to investigate a
sea-mystery, she would, of course, have had to look up information on
this point. But she had always avoided sea-and-shore problems, just
precisely on account of the labour involved. No doubt the perfect
archetypal Robert Templeton knew all about it, but the knowledge was

[line number in individual story] matching line = 384    window = 379 389

been dead, in any case?

This was a thing Robert Templeton would have known, too, for he had been
through a course of medical studies among other things and, moreover,
never went out without a clinical thermometer and other suitable
==> apparatus for testing the freshness or otherwise of bodies. But Harriet <==
had no thermometer, nor, if she had had one, would she have known how to
use it for the purpose. Robert Templeton was accustomed to say, airily,
"Judging by the amount of rigor and the temperature of the body, I
should put the time of death at such-and-such," without going into
fiddling details about the degrees Fahrenheit registered by the

[line number in individual story] matching line = 391    window = 386 396

use it for the purpose. Robert Templeton was accustomed to say, airily,
"Judging by the amount of rigor and the temperature of the body, I
should put the time of death at such-and-such," without going into
fiddling details about the degrees Fahrenheit registered by the
instrument. As for rigor, there certainly was not a trace of it
==> present--naturally; since rigor (Harriet did know this bit) does not <==
usually set in till from four to ten hours after death. The blue suit
and brown shoes showed no signs of having been wet by sea-water; the hat
was still lying on the rock. But four hours earlier, the water must have
been over the rock and over the footprints. The tragedy must be more
recent than that. She put her hand on the body. It seemed quite warm.

slumped forward--one arm between his body and the rock, the other, the
right, hanging over the rock-edge just beneath his face. It was directly
below this hand that the stream of blood ran down so uninvitingly,
streaking the water. If the weapon was anywhere it would be here. Taking
off her shoes and stockings, and turning her sleeve up to the elbow,
==> Harriet groped cautiously in the water, which was about eighteen inches <==
deep at the base of the rock. She stepped warily, for fear of treading
on a knife-edge, and it was as well that she did, for presently her hand
encountered something hard and sharp. At the cost of a slight cut on her
finger, she drew up an open cut-throat razor, already partially buried
in the sand.

The weapon was there, then; suicide seemed to be the solution after all.
==> Harriet stood with the razor in her hand, wondering whether she was <==
leaving finger-prints on the wet surface. The suicide, of course, would
have left none, since he was wearing gloves. But once again, why that
precaution? It is reasonable to wear gloves to commit a murder, but not
to commit suicide. Harriet dismissed this problem for future
consideration, and wrapped her handkerchief round the razor.

cigarette-case in the right-hand pocket; the other was empty. The

reasons, she did not want to do. The inner breast-pocket, of course, was

from the throat. Harriet excused herself by thinking that any papers in

possibly--but there it was. She could not bring herself to touch it.

sight, making for Wilvercombe.

Not quite sure whether she had done the right thing or the wrong,

the cliff. It was then just after half-past two.

turned in the direction of Wilvercombe and strode along at a good,

nothing by pumping herself out. After about a mile, she was delighted by
the sight of a fellow-traveller; a girl of about seventeen, driving a

"Are any of the men about?" asked Harriet.

The woman replied that they were all up to the seven-acre field, getting
the hay in.

==> Harriet explained that there was a dead man lying on the shore and that <==
the police ought to be informed.

"That do be terrible, surely," said the woman. "Will it be Joe Smith? He
was out with his boat this morning and the rocks be very dangerous
thereabouts. The Grinders, we call them."

"That do be terrible, surely," said the woman. "Will it be Joe Smith? He

thereabouts. The Grinders, we call them."

==> "No," said Harriet; "it isn't a fisherman--it looks like somebody from <==
the town. And he isn't drowned. He's cut his throat."

"Cut his throat?" said the woman, with relish. "Well, now, what a
terrible thing, to be sure."

the town. And he isn't drowned. He's cut his throat."

"Cut his throat?" said the woman, with relish. "Well, now, what a
terrible thing, to be sure."

==> "I want to let the police know," said Harriet, "before the tide comes in <==
and covers the body."

"The police?" The woman considered this. "Oh, yes," she said, after
mature thought. "The police did ought to be told about it."

"The police?" The woman considered this. "Oh, yes," she said, after
mature thought. "The police did ought to be told about it."

==> Harriet asked if one of the men could be found and sent with a message. <==
The woman shook her head. They were getting in the hay and the weather
did look to be changing. She doubted if anybody could be spared.

"You're not on the telephone, I suppose?" asked Harriet.

==> "You're not on the telephone, I suppose?" asked Harriet. <==

They were not on the telephone, but Mr. Carey at the Red Farm, he was on
the telephone. To get to the Red Farm, the woman added, under
interrogation, you would have to go back to the road and take the next
turning, and then it was about a mile or maybe two.

==> Was there a car Harriet could borrow? <==

The woman was sorry, but there was no car. At least, there was one, but
her daughter had gone over to Heathbury market and wouldn't be back till
late.

"If you _do_ see anybody who could take a message, would you tell them
that there's a dead man on the shore near the Grinders, and that the
police ought to be informed."

hopefully.

"Yes."

"Dear, dear," said the woman. "'Tis a terrible thing, to be sure."

==> Back on the main road, Harriet hesitated. She had lost a good deal of <==
time on this expedition. Would it be better to turn aside again in
search of the Red Farm, or to keep to the main road where there was more
chance of meeting a passer-by? While still undecided, she arrived at the
turn. An aged man was hoeing turnips in a field close by. She hailed
him.

"Is this the way to the Red Farm?"

He paid no attention, but went on hoeing turnips.

==> "He must be deaf," muttered Harriet, hailing him again. He continued to <==
hoe turnips. She was looking about for the gate into the field when the
aged man paused to straighten his back and spit on his hands, and in so
doing brought her into his line of vision.

Harriet beckoned to him, and he hobbled slowly up to the wall,

supporting himself on the hoe as he went.

"Is this the way to the Red Farm?" She pointed up the lane.

"No," said the old man, "he ain't at home."

"Is this the way to the Red Farm?" She pointed up the lane.

"No," said the old man, "he ain't at home."

==> "Has he got a telephone?" asked Harriet. <==

"Not till to-night," replied the ancient. "He's over to Heathbury
market."

"A telephone," repeated Harriet, "has he got a telephone?"

==> "A telephone," repeated Harriet, "has he got a telephone?" <==

"Oh, ay," said the old man, "you'll find her somewhere about." While
Harriet was wondering whether the pronoun was the one usually applied in
that county to telephones, he dashed her hopes by adding: "Her leg's bad
again."

"How far is it to the farm?" shouted Harriet, desperately.

"I shouldn't wonder if 'twas," said the old man, resting on the hoe, and
lifting up his hat to admit the breeze to his head, "I tell'd her

of his ear.

"How _far_ is it?" she bawled.

"There ain't no need to shout," said the old man. "I hain't deaf.

==> "How far----" began Harriet. <==

"I'm tellin 'ee, amn't I? Mile and a half by the lane, but if you was to
take the short cut through the field where the old bull is----"

A car came suddenly down the road at considerable speed and vanished

A car came suddenly down the road at considerable speed and vanished
into the distance.

==> "Oh, bother!" muttered Harriet. "I might have stopped that if I hadn't <==
wasted my time on this old idiot."

"You're quite right, miss," agreed Old Father William, catching the last
word with the usual perversity of the deaf. "Madmen, I calls 'em. There
ain't no sense in racketing along at that pace. My niece's young

word with the usual perversity of the deaf. "Madmen, I calls 'em. There
ain't no sense in racketing along at that pace. My niece's young
man----"

==> The glimpse of the car was a deciding factor in Harriet's mind. Far <==
better to stick to the road. If once she began losing herself in by-ways
on the chance of finding an elusive farm and a hypothetical telephone,
she might wander about till dinner-time. She started off again, cutting
Father William's story off abruptly in the middle, and did another
dusty half-mile without further encounter.

coast-road. And therefore all the local traffic to Heathbury was already
well away inland. Such of the aborigines as remained were at work in the
hayfields. She did, indeed, discover a man and a youth at work with a
two-horse haycutter, but they stared aghast at her suggestion that they
should leave their work and their horses to look for the police. The
==> farmer himself was (naturally) at Heathbury market. Harriet, rather <==
hopelessly, left a message with them and trudged on.

Presently there came slogging into view a figure which appeared rather
more hopeful; a man clad in shorts and carrying a pack on his back--a
hiker, like herself. She hailed him imperiously.

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 61620    window = 61615 61625


The man, a weedy, sandy-haired person with a bulging brow and thick
spectacles, gazed at her with courteous incompetence.

"I'm afraid I can't tell you. You see, I'm a stranger here myself."

==> "Well, could you----?" began Harriet, and paused. After all, what could <==
he do? He was in exactly the same boat as herself. With a foolish relic
of Victorianism she had somehow imagined that a man would display
superior energy and resourcefulness, but, after all, he was only a human
being, with the usual outfit of legs and brains.

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 61632    window = 61627 61637


She pointed vaguely behind her.

"No, really?" exclaimed the young man. "I say, that's a bit thick, isn't
it? Er--friend of yours?"

==> "Certainly not," retorted Harriet. "I don't know him from Adam. But the <==
police ought to know about it."

"The police? Oh, yes, of course, the police. Well, you'll find them in
Wilvercombe, you know. There's a police-station there."


[line number in individual story] matching line = 742    window = 737 747

police ought to know about it."

"The police? Oh, yes, of course, the police. Well, you'll find them in
Wilvercombe, you know. There's a police-station there."

==> "I know," said Harriet, "but the body's right down near low-water mark, <==
and if I can't get somebody along pretty quick the tide may wash him
away. In fact, it's probably done so already. Good lord! It's almost
four o'clock."

"The tide? Oh, yes. Yes, I suppose it would. If"--he brightened up with

"The tide? Oh, yes. Yes, I suppose it would. If"--he brightened up with
a new thought--"if it's coming in. But it might be going out, you know,
mightn't it?"

==> "It might, but it isn't," said Harriet, grimly. "It's been coming in <==
since two o'clock. Haven't you noticed?"

"Well, no, I can't say I have. I'm shortsighted. And I don't know much
about it. I live in London, you see. I'm afraid I can't quite see what I
can do about it. There don't seem to be any police about here, do

there?"

He gazed round about, as though he expected to sight a constable on
point-duty in the middle-distance.

==> "Have you passed any cottages lately?" asked Harriet. <==

"Cottages? Oh, yes--yes, I believe I did see some cottages a little way
back. Oh, yes, I'm sure I did. You'll find somebody there."

"I'll try there, then. And if you meet anybody would you mind telling

The hiker clutched his staff nervously.

"Oh! I shouldn't think so, should you?"

==> "You never know," said Harriet, exasperated. "If I were you, I'd be <==
getting along quickly. The murderer may be somewhere about, you know."

"Good heavens!" said the young man from London. "But that would be
awfully dangerous."

"Yes?"

"Don't you think I'd better come along with you? To protect you, you
know, and that sort of thing?"

==> Harriet laughed. She felt convinced that the young man was not keen on <==
passing the Grinders.

"As you like," she said indifferently, walking on.

"I could show you the cottages," suggested the young man.

"As you like," she said indifferently, walking on.

"I could show you the cottages," suggested the young man.

==> "Very well," said Harriet. "Come along. We'll have to be as quick as we <==
can."

A quarter of an hour's walk brought them to the cottages--two low
thatched buildings standing on the right-hand side of the road. In front
of them a high hedge had been planted, screening them from the sea-gales

A quarter of an hour's walk brought them to the cottages--two low
thatched buildings standing on the right-hand side of the road. In front
of them a high hedge had been planted, screening them from the sea-gales
and, incidentally, helping to cut off all view of the shore. Opposite
them, on the other side of the road, a narrow walled lane twisted down

disappointment. They were inhabited by an aged crone, two youngish women
and some small children, but the men were all out fishing. They were
late back to-day but were expected on the evening tide. Harriet's story
was listened to with flattering interest and enthusiasm, and the wives
promised to tell their husbands about it when they came in. They also

The companions then resumed their walk, the gentleman from London, whose

Surely something would soon come along.

The only thing that came was a fast saloon car, which overtook them
about half a mile further on. The proud chauffeur, seeing two dusty
trampers signalling, as it appeared to him, for a lift, put his stern

foot down on the accelerator and drove on.

"The beastly road-hog!" said Mr. Perkins, pausing to caress his
blistered heel.

==> "Saloons with chauffeurs are never any good," said Harriet. "What we <==
want is a lorry, or a seven-year-old Ford. Oh, look! What's that?"

"That" was a pair of gates across the road and a little cottage standing
beside it.

revived. "There _must_ be somebody here."

There was. There were, in fact, two people--a cripple and a small girl.
Harriet eagerly asked where she could get hold of a car or a telephone.

The child ran out to open the gates to let through a small boy leading
an immense cart-horse.

==> "Is there a train coming through?" asked Harriet, idly, as the gates <==
were pushed across the road again.

"Not for half an hour, miss. We keeps the gates shut most times. There
ain't a deal of traffic along this road, and they keeps the cattle from
straying on to the line. There's a good many trains in the day. It's the

main line from Wilvercombe to Heathbury. Of course, the expresses don't
stop here, only the locals, and they only stops twice a day, except
market days."

==> "No, I see." Harriet wondered why she was asking about the trains, and <==
then suddenly realised that, with her professional interest in
time-tables, she was instinctively checking up the ways and means of
approaching the Grinders. Train, car, boat--how had the dead man got
there?

"There's no need to stop and speak to everybody," complained Mr.
Perkins, peevishly. "I don't like the look of that fellow, and we're
quite near the place now. I came through here this morning, you know."

"There's no need to stop and speak to everybody," complained Mr.
Perkins, peevishly. "I don't like the look of that fellow, and we're
quite near the place now. I came through here this morning, you know."

==> "I only wanted to ask if there was a policeman," explained Harriet, <==
peaceably. She did not want to argue with Mr. Perkins. She had other
things to think of. Cottages had begun to appear, small, sturdy
buildings, surrounded by little patches of gay garden. The road turned
suddenly inland, and she observed with joy telegraph poles, more houses
and at length a little green, with a smithy at one corner and children

playing cricket on the grass. In the centre of the green stood an
ancient elm, with a seat round it and an ancient man basking in the
sunshine; and on the opposite side was a shop, with "Geo. Hearn:
Grocer," displayed on a sign above it.

==> "Thank goodness!" said Harriet. <==

She almost ran across the little green and into the village shop, which
was festooned with boots and frying-pans, and appeared to sell
everything from acid drops to corduroy trousers.

"Thank you," said Mr. Perkins. "But really--I mean--it's the lady's
business really. I mean to say--if there's any sort of hotel hereabouts,
I think I'd better--that is to say--er--good-evening."

==> He melted unobtrusively out of the shop. Harriet, who had already <==
forgotten his existence, followed the grocer into the back room and
watched him with impatience as he put on his spectacles and struggled
with the telephone directory.

THURSDAY, 18 JUNE

==> It was a quarter-past five when the grocer announced that Harriet's call <==
was through. Allowing for stoppages and for going out of her way to the
Brennerton Farm, she had covered rather more than four miles of the
distance between the Grinders and Wilvercombe in very nearly three
hours. True, she had actually walked six miles or more, but she felt
that a shocking amount of time had been wasted. Well, she had done her

on the beach near the Grinders."

"Oh!" said the voice. "One moment, please. Yes. The dead body of a man
at the Grinders. Yes?"

==> "He'd got his throat cut," said Harriet. <==

"Throat cut," said the official voice. "Yes?"

"I also found a razor," said Harriet.

"Who is it speaking?" it went on.

"My name is Vane, Miss Harriet Vane. I am on a walking-tour, and

happened to find him. Can you send someone out to fetch me, or shall
I----?"

"Just a moment. Name of Vane--V-A-N-E--yes. Found at two o'clock, you
say. You're a bit late letting us know, aren't you?"

"Just a moment. Name of Vane--V-A-N-E--yes. Found at two o'clock, you

==> Harriet explained that she had had difficulty in getting through to <==
them.

"I see," said the voice. "All right, miss, we'll be sending a car along.
You just stay where you are till we come. You'll have to go along with
us and show us the body."

==> "I'm afraid there won't be any body by now," said Harriet. "You see, it <==
was down quite close to the sea, on that big rock, you know, and the
tide----"

"We'll see to that, miss," replied the voice, confidently, as though the
Nautical Almanack might be expected to conform to police regulations.

"We'll see to that, miss," replied the voice, confidently, as though the
Nautical Almanack might be expected to conform to police regulations.
"The car'll be along in about ten minutes or so."

==> The receiver clicked and was silent. Harriet replaced her end of the <==
instrument and stood for a few minutes, hesitating. Then she took the
receiver off again.

"Give me Ludgate 6000--quick as ever you can. Urgent press call. I must
have it within five minutes."

"Listen--that's the number of the _Morning Star_. It's a priority call."

"Well," said the operator, dubiously, "I'll see what I can do."

Three minutes passed--four--five--six. Then the bell rang. Harriet
snatched the receiver down.

Buzz--click.

"That's right, miss. Have to ask you to stay on a bit while we look into
this. Better jump into the car and we'll run out to where you say you
saw this body. This gentleman is Dr. Fenchurch. This is Sergeant
Saunders."

==> Harriet acknowledged the introduction. <==

"Why _I've_ been brought along I _don't_ know," said the police-surgeon
in an aggrieved voice. "If this man was down near low-water mark at two
o'clock, we shan't see much of him to-night. Tide's more than half-full
now, and a strong wind blowing."

now, and a strong wind blowing."

"That's the devil of it," agreed the Inspector.

==> "I know," said Harriet, mournfully, "but really I did my best." She <==
recounted the details of her odyssey, mentioning everything she had done
at the rock and producing the shoe, the cigarette-case, the hat, the
handkerchief and the razor.

"Well, there," said the Inspector, "you seem to have done a pretty tidy

"Well, there," said the Inspector, "you seem to have done a pretty tidy
job, miss. Anybody'd think you'd made a study of it. Taking photographs
and all. Not but what," he added, sternly, "if you'd started sooner
you'd have been here before."

==> "I didn't waste much time," pleaded Harriet, "and I thought, supposing <==
the body got washed away, or anything, it would be better to have _some_
record of it."

"That's very true, miss, and I shouldn't wonder but what you did the
right thing. Looks like a big wind rising, and that'll hold the tide

"Yes," said the Inspector. "The current sets very strong round the bay,
and you can't get a boat in past the Grinders--not without you want her
bottom stove in."

==> Indeed, when they arrived at "Murder Bay," as Harriet had mentally <==
christened it, there were no signs of the rock, still less of the body.
The sea was half-way up the sand, rolling in heavily. The little line of
breakers that had shown the hidden tops of the Grinders reef had
disappeared. The wind was freshening still more, and the sun gleamed in
spasms of brilliance between thickening banks of cloud.

disappeared. The wind was freshening still more, and the sun gleamed in
spasms of brilliance between thickening banks of cloud.

"That's the place, miss, is it?" asked the Inspector.

==> "Oh, yes, that's the place," replied Harriet, confidently. <==

The Inspector shook his head.

"There's seventeen feet of water over that rock by now," he said.
"Tide'll be full in another hour. Can't do anything about it now. Have

up to Brennerton, Saunders; try and get some of the men there to keep a
look-out up and down the shore, and I'll cut along back to Wilvercombe
and see what I can arrange about getting a boat out. You'll have to
come along with me, miss, and make a statement."

==> "By all means," said Harriet, rather faintly. <==

The Inspector turned round and took a look at her.

"I expect you're feeling a bit upset, miss," he said, kindly, "and no
wonder. It's not a pleasant thing for a young lady to have to deal with.

"I expect you're feeling a bit upset, miss," he said, kindly, "and no
wonder. It's not a pleasant thing for a young lady to have to deal with.
It's a miracle to me, the way you handled it. Why, most young ladies
would have run away, let alone taking away all these boots and things."

==> "Well, you see," explained Harriet, "I know what ought to be done. I <==
write detective stories, you know," she added, feeling as she spoke that
this must appear to the Inspector an idle and foolish occupation.

"There now," said the Inspector. "It isn't often, I daresay, you get a
chance of putting your own stories into practice, as you might say. What

did you say your name was, miss? Not that I read those sort of books
much, except it might be Edgar Wallace now and again, but I'll have to
know your name, of course, in any case."

==> Harriet gave her name and her London address. The Inspector seemed to <==
come to attention rather suddenly.

"I fancy I've heard that name before," he remarked.

"Yes," said Harriet, a little grimly; "I expect you have. I am--" she

laughed rather uncomfortably--"I'm the notorious Harriet Vane, who was
tried for poisoning Philip Boyes two years ago."

==> "Quite a lot," said Harriet. <==

"He seems to be a clever gentleman," observed the Inspector. "One's
always hearing of him doing something or other."

"Yes," agreed Harriet; "he's--full of activities."

with what Harriet felt to be unnecessary curiosity.

"Oh, yes, quite well. Yes, of course." It struck her that this sounded

"You'll know him very well, I expect?" pursued the Inspector, filled
==> with what Harriet felt to be unnecessary curiosity. <==

"Oh, yes, quite well. Yes, of course." It struck her that this sounded
ungracious, seeing that Wimsey had undoubtedly saved her from a very
disagreeable position, if not from an ignominious death, and she went
on, hastily and stiltedly, "I have a great deal to thank him for."

London same as we know everybody hereabouts. Stands to reason they
couldn't. Now, in a case like this one here, ten to one we shall be able
to find all about the young man in a turn of the hand, as you might
say."

==> "He may be a visitor," said Harriet. <==

"Very likely," said the Inspector, "but I expect there'll be somebody
that knows about him, all the same. This is where you get off, Saunders.
Raise all the help you can, and get Mr. Coffin to run you over to
Wilvercombe when you're through. Now then, miss. What did you say this

young chap was like?"

==> Harriet again described the corpse. <==

"Beard, eh?" said the Inspector. "Sounds like a foreigner, doesn't it? I
can't just place him for the moment, but there's not much doubt he'll be
pretty easily traced. Now, here we are at the police-station, miss. If
you'll just step in here a minute, the Superintendent would like to see

you'll just step in here a minute, the Superintendent would like to see
you."

==> Harriet accordingly stepped in and told her story once again, this time <==
in minute detail, to Superintendent Glaisher, who received it with
flattering interest. She handed over the various things taken from the
body and her roll of film, and was then questioned exhaustively as to
how she had spent the day, both before and after finding the body.

how she had spent the day, both before and after finding the body.

"By the way," said the Superintendent, "this young fellow you met on the
road--what's become of him?"

==> Harriet stared about her as though she expected to find Mr. Perkins <==
still at her elbow.

"I haven't the slightest idea. I'd forgotten all about him. He must have
gone off while I was ringing you up."

"Odd," said Glaisher, making a note to inquire after Mr. Perkins.

==> "But he can't possibly know anything about it," said Harriet. "He was <==
fearfully surprised--and frightened. That's why he came back with me."

"We'll have to check up on him, though, as a matter of routine," said
the Superintendent. Harriet was about to protest that this was a waste
of time, when she suddenly realised that in all probability it was her

own story that was due to be "checked up on." She was silent, and the
Superintendent went on:

merely replied with the modest suggestion that Cleggs's Temperance
Hostel was generally reckoned to be as cheap and comfortable as you

newspaper reporters. "Miss Harriet Vane, when interviewed by our
correspondent at Cleggs's Temperance Hostel----" That would never do.

"Ai'm afraid," said the receptionist, casting a languid glance of
disfavour at Harriet's knapsack and shoes, "that all our rooms are
engaged."

==> "Surely not," said Harriet, "so early in the season. Just ask the <==
manager to come and speak to me for a moment." She sat down with a
determined air in the nearest well-stuffed armchair and, hailing a
waiter, demanded a cocktail.

"Will you join me, Inspector?"

"Will you join me, Inspector?"

The Inspector thanked her, but explained that a certain discretion was
due to his position.

==> "Another time, then," said Harriet, smiling, and dropping a pound-note <==
on the waiter's tray, with a somewhat ostentatious display of a
well-filled note-case.

Inspector Umpelty grinned faintly as he saw the receptionist beckon to
the waiter. Then he moved gently across to the desk and spoke a few

Inspector Umpelty grinned faintly as he saw the receptionist beckon to
the waiter. Then he moved gently across to the desk and spoke a few

deprecating smile.

"We find, madam, that we can efter all accommodate you. An American

"Oh, yes, madam. And a belcony."

won't you?"

She grinned a friendly grin at him.

"Yes, miss," said Inspector Umpelty, grinning also. He had his private

the Resplendent, it was his own private whisper of "friend of Lord Peter
Wimsey" that had produced the view over the sea, the bath and the
balcony. It was just as well that Harriet did not know this. It would
have annoyed her.

_really_ rich. Anybody who married Lord Peter would be rich, of course.
And he was amusing. Nobody could say he would be dull to live with. But
the trouble was that you never knew what anybody was like to live with
except by living with them. It wasn't worth it. Not even to know all
about steam-yachts. A novelist couldn't possibly marry all the people

over the coffee with sketching out the career of an American
detective-novelist who contracted a fresh marriage for each new book.
For a book about poisons, she would marry an analytical chemist; for a
book about somebody's will, a solicitor; for a book about strangling,
a--a hangman, of course. There might be something in it. A spoof book,

an exhibition waltz. The man was tall and fair, with sleek hair
plastered closely to his head, and a queer, unhealthy face with a wide,
melancholy mouth. The girl, in an exaggerated gown of petunia satin with
an enormous bustle and a train, exhibited a mask of Victorian coyness as
she revolved languidly in her partner's arms to the strains of the "Blue
==> Danube." "_Autres temps, autres mœurs_," thought Harriet. She looked <==
about the room. Long skirts and costumes of the 'seventies were in
evidence--and even ostrich feathers and fans. Even the coyness had its
imitators. But it was so obviously an imitation. The slender-seeming
waists were made so, not by savage tight-lacing, but by sheer expensive
dressmaking. To-morrow, on the tennis-court, the short, loose

eyes, the mock-modesty--masks, only. If this was the "return to
womanliness" hailed by the fashion-correspondents, it was to a quite
different kind of womanliness--set on a basis of economic independence.
Were men really stupid enough to believe that the good old days of
submissive womanhood could be brought back by milliners' fashions?
==> "Hardly," thought Harriet, "when they know perfectly well that one has <==
only to remove the train and the bustle, get into a short skirt and walk
off, with a job to do and money in one's pocket. Oh, well, it's a game,
and presumably they all know the rules."

The dancers twirled to a standstill with the conclusion of the waltz.

the male dancer selected a partner from one of the nearer tables, while
the petunia-clad girl obeyed a summons from a stout manufacturer in
tweeds on the other side of the room. Another girl, a blonde in pale
blue, rose from her solitary table near the platform and led out an
elderly man. Other visitors rose, accompanied by their own partners, and
==> took the floor to the strains of another waltz. Harriet beckoned to the <==
waiter and asked for more coffee.

Men, she thought, like the illusion that woman is dependent on their
approbation and favour for her whole interest in life. But do they like
the reality? Not, thought Harriet, bitterly, when one is past one's

approbation and favour for her whole interest in life. But do they like
==> the reality? Not, thought Harriet, bitterly, when one is past one's <==
first youth. The girl over there, exercising S.A. on a group of rather
possessive-looking males, will turn into a predatory hag like the woman
at the next table, if she doesn't find something to occupy her mind,
always supposing that she has a mind. Then the men will say she puts the
wind up them.

always supposing that she has a mind. Then the men will say she puts the
wind up them.

The "predatory hag" was a lean woman, pathetically made-up, dressed in
an exaggeration of the fashion which it would have been difficult for a
==> girl of nineteen to carry off successfully. She had caught Harriet's <==
attention earlier by her look of radiant, almost bridal exaltation. She
was alone, but seemed to be expecting somebody, for her gaze roamed
incessantly about the room, concentrating itself chiefly on the
professionals' table near the platform. Now she appeared to be getting
anxious. Her ringed hands twitched nervously, and she lighted one

anxious. Her ringed hands twitched nervously, and she lighted one
cigarette after another, only to stub it out, half-smoked, snatch at the
mirror in her handbag, readjust her make-up, fidget, and then begin the
whole process again with another cigarette.

==> "Waiting for her gigolo," diagnosed Harriet, with a kind of pitiful <==
disgust. "The frog-mouthed gentleman, I suppose. He seems to have better
fish to fry."

The waiter brought the coffee, and the woman at the next table caught
him on his way back.

does not matter."

"No, madam, thank you, madam."

head waiter. Lips and eyebrows were eloquent. Harriet felt annoyed. Did
one come to this, then, if one did not marry? Making a public scorn of
one's self before the waiters? She glanced again at the woman, who was
rising to leave the lounge. She wore a wedding-ring. Marriage did not
save one, apparently. Single, married, widowed, divorced, one came to

FRIDAY, 19 JUNE

In spite of the horrors she had witnessed, which ought to have driven
==> all sleep away from the eyelids of any self-respecting female, Harriet <==
slept profoundly in her first-floor bedroom (with bathroom, balcony and
view over Esplanade) and came down to breakfast with a hearty appetite.

She secured a copy of the _Morning Star_, and was deep in the perusal of
her own interview (with photograph) on the front page, when a familiar

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 62443    window = 62438 62448


voice addressed her:

"Good morning, Sherlock. Where is the dressing-gown? How many pipes of
shag have you consumed? The hypodermic is on the dressing-room table."

==> "How in the world," demanded Harriet, "did _you_ get here?" <==

"Car," said Lord Peter, briefly. "Have they produced the body?"

"Who told you about the body?"

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 62452    window = 62447 62457


"Who told you about the body?"

"I nosed it from afar. Where the carcase is, there shall the eagles be
gathered together. May I join you over the bacon-and-eggs?"

==> "By all means," said Harriet. "Where did you come from?" <==

"From London--like a bird that hears the call of its mate."

"I didn't----" began Harriet.

"From London--like a bird that hears the call of its mate."

"I didn't mean you. I meant the corpse. But still, talking of mates,
will you marry me?"

"Certainly not."

blowing great guns. Tiresome for them. Can't have an inquest without a
body. You must produce the body, as it says in the Have-His-Carcase
Act."

==> "No, but really," protested Harriet, "how did you hear about it?" <==

"Salcombe Hardy rang me up from the _Morning Star_. Said 'my Miss Vane'
had found a corpse, and did I know anything about it. I said I knew
nothing about it and that Miss Vane was unhappily not mine--yet. So I
buzzed off, and here I am. I brought Sally Hardy down with me. I expect

"Yes--he seemed to know all about it. I was rather hurt. Fancy having to
ask the _Morning Star_ where the pole-star of one's own heaven has gone
to. Hardy seemed to know all about it. How do these things get into the
papers?"

==> "I rang them up myself," replied Harriet. "First-class publicity, you <==
know, and all that."

"So it is," agreed Wimsey, helping himself lavishly to butter. "Rang 'em
up, did you, with all the gory details?"

"You're a woman of business. But does it not, pardon me, indicate a

matting."

"Without even 'Welcome' written across them. But, look here, beloved,
bearing in mind that I'm a corpse-fan, don't you think you might, as man
to man, have let me in on the ground-floor?"

"I certainly might. But I thought----"

"Women _will_ let the personal element crop in," said Wimsey, acutely.
"Well, all I can say is, you owe it to me to make up for it now. _All_

the place where the body was found, which, as the tide is well up, they
will not see. Tell me all, here and now, and I will organise your
publicity for you."

==> "Very well," said Harriet. "I tell thee all, I can no more." <==

She pushed her plate aside and took up a clean knife.

"This," she said, "is the coast-road from Lesston Hoe to Wilvercombe.
The shore bends about like this----" She took up the pepper-pot.

Wimsey twitched his chair closer to the table.

"And this salt-spoon," he said, with childlike enjoyment, "can be the
body."

==> He made no comment while Harriet told her story, only interrupting once <==
or twice with a question about times and distances. He sat drooping
above the sketch-map she was laying out among the breakfast-things, his
eyes invisible, his long nose seeming to twitch like a rabbit's with
concentration. When she had finished, he sat silent for a moment and
then said:

that troubles me is the weapon. Why should a gentleman with a beard
sport a cut-throat razor?"

"Bought for the purpose."

==> "Yes; after all, why not? My dear Harriet, I think you are right. The <==
man cut his throat, and that's all there is to it. I am disappointed."

It was indeed Inspector Umpelty who was threading his way between the
tables. He was in mufti--a large, comfortable-looking tweed-clad figure.

"I thought you might like to see how your snaps have turned out, Miss
Vane. And we've identified the man."

"No? Have you? Good work. This is Inspector Umpelty--Lord Peter Wimsey."

with these foreigners, can you?"

"Yes. He's a Russian, or something of that. Paul Alexis Goldschmidt, his
name is; known as Paul Alexis. Comes from this very hotel, as a matter
of fact. One of the professional dancing-partners in the lounge

is the poor blighter himself, and he's dead. But as regards the papers,
you're dead right. I'm going along there now." He paused, doubtfully,
==> and looked from Harriet to Wimsey and back again. <==

"No," said Wimsey. "Set your mind at rest. We are not going to ask to
come with you. I know that the amateur detective has a habit of
embarrassing the police in the execution of their duty. We are going out
to view the town like a perfect little lady and gentleman. There's only

The Inspector was very willing that Lord Peter should see the razor.
"And if you like to comerlongerme," he added kindly, "you'll dodge all
these reporters."

==> "Not me!" said Harriet. "I've got to see them and tell them all about my <==
new book. A razor is only a razor, but good advance publicity means
sales. You two run along; I'll follow you down."

She strolled away in search of the reporters. The Inspector grinned
uneasily.

to that young woman's apron-strings," he reflected, as he shouldered his
bulky way through the revolving doors. "The poor mutt!"

colleagues, found Wimsey faithfully in attendance.

"I've got rid of the Inspector," observed that gentleman, cheerfully.
"Get your hat on and we'll go."

Their simultaneous exit from the Resplendent was observed and recorded
by the photographic contingent, who had just returned from the shore.
Between an avenue of clicking shutters, they descended the marble steps,
and climbed into Wimsey's Daimler.

St. George's, Hanover Square."

"No, you don't," retorted Wimsey. "If we had, you would be trembling
like a fluttered partridge. Being married to me is a tremendous

he observed. "But the sea seems to have done its work pretty

weapon after all?"

exchange, now burst into a hearty guffaw.

side-streets, "to renounce our little programme of viewing the town. I
should have enjoyed that simple pleasure. But unless I start at once, I
shan't get to town and back to-night."

not waste time rubber-necking round Wilvercombe with Lord Peter,
experienced an unreasonable feeling of having been cheated.

question of expense, exactly. The shoes are hand-made--which merely
proves that a dancer has to take care of his feet. But _could_ a man who
is shaved by Endicott possibly order--deliberately _order_--shoes of
that colour and shape? A thing imagination boggles at."

==> "I'm afraid," admitted Harriet, "that I have never managed to learn all <==
the subtle rules and regulations about male clothing. That's why I made
Robert Templeton one of those untidy dressers."

"Robert Templeton's clothes have always pained me," confessed Wimsey.
"The one blot on your otherwise fascinating tales. But to leave that

"But he might have sold the stock?"

"That's what I want to find out. I'll have to be off now. I'll try and
be back to-night, so don't worry."

happy."

"Splendid. Oh! While I'm about it, shall I see about getting a
marriage-licence?"

word 'skin' is.) 'Blossoms of the honey-sweet and honey-coloured
menuphar'--I always have a quotation for everything--it saves original
thinking."

==> "Blast the man!" said Harriet, left abruptly alone in the blue-plush <==
lounge. Then she suddenly ran out down the steps and leapt upon the
Daimler's running-board.

"Port or sherry?" she demanded.

"Claret," said Wimsey. "Château Margaux 1893 or thereabouts. I'm not
particular to a year or two."

voice, faintly familiar, accosted her:

"Miss--er--Miss Vane? Might I speak to you for a moment?"

It was the "predatory hag" whom she had seen the evening before in the

FRIDAY, 19 JUNE

==> Harriet had almost forgotten the woman's existence, but now the whole of <==
the little episode came back to her, and she wondered how she could have
been so stupid. The nervous waiting; the vague, enraptured look,
changing gradually to peevish impatience; the inquiry for Mr. Alexis;
the hasty and chagrined departure from the room. Glancing at the woman's
face now, she saw it so old, so ravaged with grief and fear, that a kind

added, as they walked across to the lift:

"My name is Weldon--Mrs. Weldon. I've been staying here some time. Mr.
Greely--the manager, that is--knows me very well."

==> "That's all right," said Harriet. She realised that Mrs. Weldon was <==
trying to explain that she was not a confidence-trickster or a
hotel-crook or a white-slave agent, and was herself trying to make it
clear that she did not suppose Mrs. Weldon to be any of these things.
She felt shy and this made her speak gruffly. She saw a "scene" looming
ahead, and she was not one of those women who enjoy "scenes." She led

chamber-maid told me a horrible story--I went to the manager--he
wouldn't tell me anything--I saw you with the police--and all those
reporters were talking--they pointed you out--oh, Miss Vane, _please_
tell me what has happened."

==> Harriet cleared her throat and began searching her pockets instinctively <==
for cigarettes.

"I'm awfully sorry," she began. "I'm afraid something rather beastly has
happened. You see--I happened to be down on the shore yesterday
afternoon, and I found a man lying there--dead. And from what they say,

"Oh, he couldn't have! he couldn't have! Indeed, Miss Vane, there must
be a mistake. He must have had an accident."

==> Harriet shook her head. <==

"But you don't know--how could you?--how impossible it all is. But
people shouldn't say such cruel things. He was so perfectly happy--he
_couldn't_ have done anything like that. Why, he----" Mrs. Weldon
stopped, searching Harriet's face with her famished eyes. "I heard them

Harriet shook her head.

"But you don't know--how could you?--how impossible it all is. But
people shouldn't say such cruel things. He was so perfectly happy--he
_couldn't_ have done anything like that. Why, he----" Mrs. Weldon

saying something about a razor--Miss Vane! What killed him?"

There were no kindly words for this--not even a long, scientific, Latin
name.

"Oh!" Mrs. Weldon seemed to shrink into a mere set of eyes and bones.
"Yes--they said--they said--I couldn't hear properly--I didn't like to
ask--and they all seemed so pleased about it."

==> "I know," said Harriet. "You see--these newspaper men--it's what they <==
live by. They don't mean anything. It's bread-and-butter to them. They
can't help it. And they couldn't possibly know that it meant anything to
you."

"No--but it does. But you--_you_ don't want to make it out worse than it

you."

"No--but it does. But you--_you_ don't want to make it out worse than it
is. I can trust _you_."

==> "You can trust me," said Harriet slowly, "but really and truly it could <==
not have been an accident. I don't want to give you the details, but
believe me, there's no possibility of accident."

"Then it can't be Mr. Alexis. Where is he? Can I see him?"

"Then it can't be Mr. Alexis. Where is he? Can I see him?"

"Then it must be somebody else! How do they know it is Paul?"

Harriet reluctantly mentioned the photograph, knowing what the next
request would be.

Harriet explained that the body had not been recovered.

"Oh, God! Oh, God!..."

Harriet rang the bell and, stepping out into the corridor, caught the

Better, perhaps, to set all doubt at rest. Harriet slowly produced the

"Oh, God! Oh, God!..."

==> Harriet rang the bell and, stepping out into the corridor, caught the <==
waiter and asked for a stiff whisky-and-soda. When it came, she took it
in herself and made Mrs. Weldon drink it. Then she fetched a clean
handkerchief and waited for the storm to subside. She sat on the arm of
the chair and patted Mrs. Weldon rather helplessly on the shoulder.
Mercifully, the crisis took the form of violent sobbing and not of

handkerchief and waited for the storm to subside. She sat on the arm of
the chair and patted Mrs. Weldon rather helplessly on the shoulder.
Mercifully, the crisis took the form of violent sobbing and not of
hysterics. She felt an increased respect for Mrs. Weldon. When the sobs
had subsided a little, and the groping fingers began to fumble with the
==> handbag, Harriet pushed the handkerchief into them. <==

"Thank you, my dear," said Mrs. Weldon, meekly. She began to wipe her
eyes, daubing the linen with red and black streaks from her make-up.
Then she blew her nose and sat up.

eyes, daubing the linen with red and black streaks from her make-up.
Then she blew her nose and sat up.

"I'm sorry," she began, forlornly.

==> "That's all right," said Harriet, again. "I'm afraid you've had rather a <==
shock. Perhaps you'd like to bathe your eyes a bit. It'll make you feel
better, don't you think?"

She supplied a sponge and towel. Mrs. Weldon removed the grotesque
traces of her grief and made her appearance from within the folds of the

movement towards her handbag, and then abandoned it.

"I look awful," she said, with a dreary little laugh, "but--what's it
matter, now?"

==> "I shouldn't mind about it," said Harriet. "You look quite nice. Really <==
and truly. Come and sit down. Have a cigarette. And let me give you a
phenacetin or something. I expect you've got a bit of a headache."

"Thank you. You're very kind. I won't be stupid again. I'm giving you a
lot of trouble."

I'm not clever. I do wish I was. I think I should have been happier if
I'd been clever. It must be nice to _do_ things. I've so often thought
that if I could have painted pictures or ridden a motor-cycle or
something, I should have got more out of life."

==> Harriet agreed, gravely, that it was perhaps a good thing to have an <==
occupation of some sort.

"But of course," said Mrs. Weldon, "I was never brought up to that. I
have lived for my emotions. I can't help it. I suppose I am made that
way. Of course, my married life was a tragedy. But that's all over now.

kinder to me, I could have lived _in_ and _for_ him. Everybody always
said what a wonderful mother I was. But it's terribly lonely when one's
own child deserts one, and one can't be blamed for snatching a little
happiness, can one?"

==> "I know that," said Harriet. "I've tried snatching. It didn't work, <==
though."

"Didn't it?"

"No. We quarrelled, and then--well, he died and they thought I'd

"Yes, of course. I'm so stupid--I can't even explain things properly.
But you see, Miss Vane, I _know_, I know absolutely, that poor Paul
couldn't have--done anything rash. He couldn't. He was so utterly happy
with me, and looking forward to it all."

==> "To what?" asked Harriet. <==

"Why, to our marriage," said Mrs. Weldon, as though the matter was
self-evident.

"Oh, I see. I'm so sorry. I didn't realise you were going to be married.

dancer. I told him--when we got to know one another better--that he was
a prince in my heart now, and he said that that was better to him than
an Imperial crown, poor boy. He loved me terribly. He quite frightened
me sometimes. Russians are so passionate, you know."

==> "Of course, of course," said Harriet. "You didn't have any <==
misunderstanding or anything that might have led him----?"

"Oh, _no_! We were too marvellously at one together. We danced together
that last night, and he whispered to me that there was a _great_ and
wonderful change coming into his life. He was eagerness and excitement.

because my name is Flora--such a dreadful name, I can't think how my
poor dear parents came to choose it--'It is the heart that counts, and
your heart is just seventeen.' It was beautiful of him, but quite true.
I felt seventeen when I was with him."

==> Harriet murmured something inaudible. This conversation was dreadful to <==
her. It was nauseating, pitiful, artificial yet horribly real;
grotesquely comic and worse than tragic. She wanted to stop it at all
costs, and she wanted at all costs to go on and disentangle the few
threads of fact from the gaudy tangle of absurdity.

meant nothing to me--nothing at all. 'The heart of a girl with the
experience of a woman'--that was Paul's lovely way of putting it. And
it was true, my dear, indeed it was."

==> "I'm sure it was," said Harriet, trying to put conviction into her tone. <==

"Paul--he was so handsome and so graceful--if you could have seen him as
he was! And he was very modest and not the least bit spoilt, though
_all_ the women ran after him. He was afraid to speak to me for a long
time--to tell me how he felt about me, I mean. As a matter of fact, I

"He got work at a night-club, washing up glasses. He says the girls
there were kind to him, but of course, he never talked much about that
time. He was sensitive, you see. He thought people would look down on
him if they knew he had done that kind of work."

==> "I suppose that was where he learnt to dance," said Harriet, <==
thoughtfully.

"Oh, yes--he was a marvellous dancer. It was in his blood, you know.
When he was old enough, he got work as a professional partner and did
very well, though of course it wasn't the kind of life he wanted."

"Oh, yes--he was a marvellous dancer. It was in his blood, you know.

thoughtfully, thinking of the too-smart clothes and the hand-made shoes.

"Yes; he worked very hard. But he never was strong, and he told me that
he wouldn't be able to keep on much longer with the dancing. He had some
trouble in one of his knees--arthritis or something, and he was afraid

London. But the place went bankrupt, or got shut up by the police, or
something, and he came here for a little holiday on what he had saved.
Then he found they wanted a dancer here and he took the job temporarily,
and he was so brilliant that the management kept him on."

==> "I see." Harriet reflected that it was going to be too difficult to <==
trace these movements of Alexis through the Ghetto of New York and the
mushroom clubs of the West End.

"Yes--Paul used to say it was the hand of Destiny that brought him and
me here together. It does seem strange, doesn't it? We both just

me here together. It does seem strange, doesn't it? We both just
happened to come--by accident--just as though we were fated to meet. And
now----"

The tears ran down Mrs. Weldon's cheeks, and she gazed up helplessly at

"We were both so sad and lonely; and we were going to be happy
together."

"It's frightfully sad," said Harriet, inadequately. "I suppose Mr.

Harriet.

"We were both so sad and lonely; and we were going to be happy

==> "It's frightfully sad," said Harriet, inadequately. "I suppose Mr. <==
Alexis was rather temperamental."

himself--no, never! I know he didn't. He was temperamental, of course,
but he was radiantly happy with me. I'll never believe he just went away

like that, without even saying good-bye to me. It isn't possible, Miss
Vane. You've got to _prove_ that it wasn't possible. You're so clever, I
know you can do it. That's why I wanted to see you and tell you about
Paul."

==> "You realise," said Harriet, slowly, "that if he didn't do it himself, <==
somebody else must have done it."

"Why not?" cried Mrs. Weldon, eagerly. "Somebody must have envied our
happiness. Paul was so handsome and romantic--there must have been
people who were jealous of us. Or it may have been the Bolsheviks. Those

killed Paul, and I shouldn't wonder if they started throwing bombs at
the King and Queen next. It ought to be stopped, or we shall have a
revolution. Why, they even distribute their disgusting pamphlets to the
Navy."

==> "Well," said Harriet, "we must wait and see what they find out. I'm <==
afraid you may have to tell the police about some of this. It won't be
very pleasant for you, I'm afraid, but they'll want to know everything
they can."

"I'm sure I don't mind what I have to go through," said Mrs. Weldon,

"I'm sure I don't mind what I have to go through," said Mrs. Weldon,
wiping her eyes resolutely, "if only I can help to clear Paul's memory.
Thank you _very_ much, Miss Vane. I'm afraid I've taken up your time.
You've been very kind."

==> "Not at all," said Harriet. "We'll do our best." <==

She escorted her visitor to the door, and then returned to an armchair
and a thoughtful cigarette. Was the imminent prospect of matrimony with
Mrs. Weldon a sufficient motive for suicide? She was inclined to think
not. One can always take flight from these things. But with

Seated behind the steering-wheel, Wimsey debated the three courses open
to him. He could go to Eastbourne; he could go to Stamford; he could
return to Wilvercombe. A natural inclination pointed to Wilvercombe. It
was, surely, only justifiable to return at once to the scene of the

purely accidental complication. On the other hand, his obvious duty was
to clear up this razor business as quickly as possible. Musing, he drove
to his own flat in Piccadilly, where he found his man, Bunter, mounting
photographs in a large album.

FRIDAY, 19 JUNE--Evening

==> Miss Harriet Vane, in a claret-coloured frock, swayed round the <==
dance-lounge of the Hotel Resplendent in the arms of Mr. Antoine, the
fair-haired gigolo.

"I'm afraid I am not a very good dancer," she remarked, apologetically.

encouragement.

"Is that the kind of thing you have to say to all these old ladies?"

Antoine opened his eyes a trifle and then, mocking back to her mockery,
said:

"I am afraid so. That is part of our job, you know."

"_Ce pauvre Alexis!_ It was mademoiselle who found him, I understand?"

"Yes. I just wondered what sort of person he was, and why he should

"Ah! that is what we are all wondering. It is, no doubt, the Russian
temperament."

he was engaged to be married."

"Oh, yes--to the English lady. That was understood."

"From what he said to us, mademoiselle, I know of nothing which could

Antoine's smile was a sufficient answer.

The music stopped.

midnight, found herself seated on a red-plush settee beneath a row of

Charis, superb in her vigorous youth, expressed contempt by voice and

fishing-boat from a 5-metre yacht, but because one naturally, when
visiting the seaside, puts down all boats as fishing-boats until
otherwise instructed. She thought it had a pointed sort of sail--or
sails--she couldn't be sure. She was sure it was not, for example, a

and making fast and pushing off again and setting sail and all that.
Hence I suggest the accomplice."

thought it was very dangerous to bring boats close to shore at that

that help with our boat-theory at all, I wonder?"

"Ah!" Inspector Umpelty winked in a friendly manner at Wimsey. "When the
ladies get to knowing things by this feminine intuition and all that,
there's no arguing with it. But what I say is, let's suppose it, just
for the moment."

==> "I won't suppose it," retorted Harriet. <==

"We seem to have reached a no-thoroughfare," remarked Wimsey. "Let's
leave that for the time being, Inspector. You can come and suppose it in
the bar, quietly, later on. Though I don't think it very likely myself.
It's our turn to suppose something. Suppose a fishing-boat had wanted to

the Grinders, but do they? No. You'd think some of them was out for a
day's suicide, the way they go on. But I've got an idea who it was, all
the same."

"How about these cottages along the coast, where I went to try and get
==> help?" asked Harriet. "Surely they must have seen the boat? I thought <==
those sort of people knew every boat in the place by sight."

"That's just it," replied the Inspector. "We've asked them and they're
all struck blind and dumb, seemingly. That's why I say I think I could
put a name to the boat. But we'll find a way to make them come across

"Yes," admitted Inspector Umpelty, "if what you and the lady tell me is
correct, that does seem to settle it. Not but what I'd like a doctor's
opinion on it, no offence to you. But I think you're right, all the
same. It's a great pity you happened to fall asleep when you did, miss."
==> He looked reproachfully at Harriet. <==

"But wasn't it lucky I was there at all?"

The Inspector agreed that it was.

County Council to take a census of the vehicular traffic passing along
the said road, and one of these watchers had been stationed, during the
whole of Thursday, 18 June, at the junction formed by the coast-road and
the high road from Lesston Hoe to Heathbury. At the other end of the
twelve miles or so which interested the detectives was Darley Halt,
==> where, as Harriet had already discovered for herself, the gates were <==
always shut unless particularly summoned to be opened for a passing
vehicle. On either side of the railway gates was a wicket for foot
passengers, but this was of the kind that does not admit anything so
large even as a push-cycle. It was clear, therefore, that unless the
hypothetical murderer had come on foot, he must have been seen at one

"I see. Well then. Three: the murderer walked the whole way along the
coast from Darley or Wilvercombe. By the way, didn't you say there was
somebody camping out along there, just beyond Darley Halt."

==> "Yes," said Harriet, "a square-built sort of man, who spoke--well, not <==
quite like a countryman--like a gentleman of the country sort."

"If anybody had passed that way, he might have seen him."

"So he might," replied the Inspector, "but unfortunately we haven't laid

"Exactly. All the same, I'd rather like to have a chat with him. There
are points about him which seem to me suggestive, as Sherlock Holmes
would say. What do _you_ think, my dear Robert Templeton?"

==> "I think," replied Harriet, promptly, "that if I had been inventing a <==
way for a murderer to reach an appointed spot and leave it again,
complete with bag and baggage and without leaving more trail than was
absolutely unavoidable, I should have made him act very much as Mr.
Martin has acted. He would open an account under a false name at a bank,

grateful to his perspiring brow, however much it might hold up the
Inspector's salvage operations. The sky was cloudy, but so long as the
wind held, there was, he felt, not much likelihood of rain, and he was
glad, for he didn't want rain. A vague possibility was forming itself in
==> his mind, and he wanted to take a walk next day with Harriet Vane. At <==
the moment, he could do no more. He would go back and change and eat and
be normal.

He drove back to Wilvercombe.

son."

me. So very sweet of you, Henry dear. I have just been telling Henry how
good Miss Vane has been to me, and how _hard_ you and she are working to
clear poor Paul's memory."

==> Harriet had merely been mischievous. Henry was certainly not handsome, <==
though he was a good, sturdy specimen of his type. He stood about five
foot eleven--a strongly built, heavyish man with a brick-red all-weather
face. Evening dress did not suit him, for the breadth of his shoulders
and the shortness of his legs gave him a rather top-heavy appearance;
one would expect him to look his best in country tweeds and leggings.

felt that he could dissect Henry more conveniently in a private
interview.

As the two men's backs disappeared in the direction of the bar, Mrs.

"How nice Lord Peter is," she said, "and what a comforting thing it is

Weldon turned her anxious eyes on Harriet.

"How nice Lord Peter is," she said, "and what a comforting thing it is
for us both to have a man to rely on."

==> This sentiment was not very well received; Harriet averted her gaze from <==
Lord Peter's back, on which it had been absentmindedly and unaccountably
fixed, and frowned; but Mrs. Weldon bleated on, unheeding.

"It's beautiful how kind everybody is when one is in trouble. Henry and
I haven't always been as close to one another as a mother and son should

to me about this sad affair. When I wrote to him and told him how much I
_felt_ the dreadful things they were saying about Paul, he came at
_once_ to help me, though I know he must be terribly busy just now. I
really feel that poor Paul's death has brought us closer together."

==> Harriet said that that must be a great comfort to Mrs. Weldon. It was <==
the only possible answer.

Henry, meanwhile, had his own view of the matter to put before Lord
Peter.

Mr. Weldon's rather massive hinder-end, and followed, ruminating.

A message from the waiter informed him that the ladies had adjourned
into the dance-lounge. Henry growled, but was relieved to find that his
==> mother was, after all, not dancing. She was watching Harriet who, clad <==
in claret-colour, was revolving smoothly in the practised arm of
Antoine. Wimsey politely begged Mrs. Weldon to favour him, but she shook
her head.

"I couldn't. Not so soon. In fact, never again--now that Paul----But I

"I couldn't. Not so soon. In fact, never again--now that Paul----But I
begged Miss Vane to enjoy herself and not mind about me. It is such a
delight to watch her looking so happy."

==> Wimsey sat down and did his best to enjoy the spectacle of Harriet's <==
happiness. As the quick-step came to an end, Antoine, with professional
tact, contrived to end his progress in the neighbourhood of their table
and then, bowing gracefully, melted away. Harriet, a little flushed,
smiled amiably upon Lord Peter.

smiled amiably upon Lord Peter.

"Oh, there you are," said his lordship.

==> Harriet became suddenly conscious that every woman in the room was <==
gazing furtively or with frank interest at Wimsey and herself, and the
knowledge exhilarated her.

"Yes," she said, "here I am. Frivolling. You didn't know I could do it,
did you?"

"Oh, no. I can only do what I like doing."

"We'll see about that."

The orchestra swung gently into a dreamy tune. Wimsey advanced upon
==> Harriet and steered her competently out into the centre of the room. For <==
the first few bars of the music they had the floor to themselves.

"At last," said Wimsey, "we are alone. That is not an original remark,
but I am in no condition to invent epigrams. I have been suffering

her.

"What," said Wimsey, "do you make of Mr. Henry Weldon?"

"Oh!"

"What," said Wimsey, "do you make of Mr. Henry Weldon?"

"Oh!"

==> This was not quite the question Harriet had expected. She hastily <==
collected her ideas. It was very necessary that she should be the
perfect unemotional sleuth.

"His manners are dreadful," she said, "and I don't think his brains are
much to write home about."

"Oh?"

"And I'd like to know why."

==> Silence for a few moments. Harriet felt that Wimsey ought to be saying, <==
"How well you dance." Since he did not say it, she became convinced that
she was dancing like a wax doll with sawdust legs. Wimsey had never
danced with her, never held her in his arms before. It should have been
an epoch-making moment for him. But his mind appeared to be concentrated
upon the dull personality of an East Anglian farmer. She fell a victim

upon the dull personality of an East Anglian farmer. She fell a victim
to an inferiority complex, and tripped over her partner's feet.

"Sorry," said Wimsey, accepting responsibility like a gentleman.

==> "It's my fault," said Harriet. "I'm a rotten dancer. Don't bother about <==
me. Let's stop. You haven't got to be polite to me, you know."

Worse and worse. She was being peevish and egotistical. Wimsey glanced
down at her in surprise and then suddenly smiled.

"Darling, if you danced like an elderly elephant with arthritis, I would
dance the sun and moon into the sea with you. I have waited a thousand
years to see you dance in that frock."

==> "Idiot!" said Harriet. <==

They made the circuit of the room in silence and harmony. Antoine,
guiding an enormous person in jade-green and diamonds, swam comet-like
into their orbit and murmured into Harriet's ear across an expanse of
fat white shoulder:

couples at Antoine's elegant back.

       *       *       *       *       *

==> "Tell me now," said Harriet. The ending of the dance had found them on <==
the opposite side of the room from the Weldons, and it seemed natural to
sit down at the nearest table. "Tell me, what is biting you about Henry
Weldon?"

"Henry Weldon?" Wimsey jerked his mind back from an immense distance.

up to scratch nobly, and was offering £100 reward for information about
the razor that had slain Paul Alexis. Bunter, returning from his
fruitless journey to Eastbourne, had come on to join his master at
Wilvercombe, bringing with him a fresh supply of shirts, collars, and
==> other garments. Harriet Vane had danced with Lord Peter in a <==
wine-coloured frock. Wimsey considered, rightly, that when a woman takes
a man's advice about the purchase of clothes, it is a sign that she is
not indifferent to his opinion. Various women, at various times and in
various quarters of the globe, had clothed themselves by Wimsey's advice
and sometimes also at his expense--but then, he had fully expected them

that afternoon from the Flat-Iron to Darley in search of clues. Low
water being billed to take place at 4.45, they had arranged to drive out
to the Flat-Iron, arriving there at 3.30. After a little light
refreshment, the expedition would set out, searching conscientiously for
whatever the shore might have to show them, while Bunter brought the car

to the Flat-Iron, arriving there at 3.30. After a little light
refreshment, the expedition would set out, searching conscientiously for
whatever the shore might have to show them, while Bunter brought the car
back by the road to Hinks's Lane; after which all three would return to
their base at Wilvercombe in their original formation. It was all very
==> clear, except that Harriet did not see--and said as much--what clues <==
were likely to remain on the open shore after nearly a week of
exceptionally high tides. She admitted however, that she needed exercise
and that walking was better exercise than most.

And--most immediate of pleasant things to look forward to--Harriet had

==> And--most immediate of pleasant things to look forward to--Harriet had <==
further agreed to receive Lord Peter Wimsey after breakfast at the
Resplendent, for a conference. It was necessary, in Wimsey's opinion,
that the progress made so far should be tabulated and brought into some
sort of order. Ten o'clock was the hour fixed for this meeting, and
Wimsey was lingering lovingly over his bacon and eggs, so as to leave no

The ratepayers grumble enough as it is, and we can't keep the witnesses
hanging round here for ever. Well, so long. We shall have another shot
at low tide."

At ten o'clock Wimsey and his collaborator sat down before a neat pile
==> of scribbling paper. Harriet was inclined to be brief and businesslike. <==

"What system are we going to adopt about this? Do you favour the Michael
Finsbury method by double entry as in _The Wrong Box_? Or one of those
charts, made out in columns, with headings for 'Suspect,' 'Alibi,'
'Witnesses,' 'Motive' and so on, worked out in percentages?"

   (which he never used) was
   found by the body, and he
   was wearing gloves.

problems for Robert Templeton. The only thing I can do much about is
interviewing this Leila person and her new young man. I fancy I might
get more out of them than the police could."

"There's nothing I can do that the police can't do better," said Wimsey,

"And that," said Wimsey, triumphantly adding a flourish at the foot of
this schedule, "rounds off the inquiry charmingly."

She scribbled for a moment.

"Not with my hands tied."

"Oh!--well, all right. But it all sounds so dreary and exhausting," said
Harriet, and burst idiotically into tears.

==> "Good Heavens!" said Wimsey, aghast. "Harriet! darling! angel! beast! <==
vixen! don't say that." He flung himself on his knees in a frenzy of
remorse and agitation. "Call me anything you like, but not dreary! Not
one of those things you find in clubs! Have this one, darling, it's much
larger and quite clean. Say you didn't mean it! Great Scott! Have I been
boring you interminably for eighteen months on end? A thing any

"Bright? By jove, yes, I'll come along right away. Hear that, my child?
The man Bright has materialised! See you this afternoon at 3.30."

He bolted out like a cat that hears the cry of "Meat, meat!"

==> "Oh! what a fool I am," said Harriet. "What an utter, drivelling fool! <==
And I haven't done a stroke of work since Wednesday."

She pulled out the manuscript of _The Fountain-Pen Mystery_, unscrewed
her own pen, and sank into an idle reverie.

TUESDAY, 23 JUNE

==> In the meantime, Harriet's novel was not getting along very well. Not <==
only was there the tiresomeness about the town-clock--or ought it to be
called the Tolbooth clock?--but also she had arrived at the point where,
according to the serial editor who was paying for the first rights, the
heroine and the detective's friend were expected to indulge in a spot of
love-making. Now, a person whose previous experience of love has been

disappointing, and who has just been through a harassing scene with
another suitor and is, further, busily engaged in investigating the
rather sordid love-affairs of a third party who has been brought to a
violent and blood-boltered end, is in no mood to sit down and deal
competently with the raptures of two innocents holding hands in a
==> rose-garden. Harriet shook her head impatiently, and plunged into her <==
distasteful task.

     "I say, Betty, I'm afraid you must think I'm a pretty average sort
     of idiot."


[line number in individual story] matching line = 7049    window = 7044 7054

     of idiot."

     "But I don't think you're an idiot at all, you idiot."

Would even the readers of the _Daily Message_ think that amusing?
==> Harriet feared not. Well, better get on with it. The girl would have to <==
say something encouraging now, or the stammering young imbecile would
never come to the point.

     "I think it's perfectly wonderful that you should be doing all this
     to help me."

     "Well, Jack?

     "Betty--darling--I suppose you couldn't possibly--"

==> Harriet came to the conclusion that she couldn't--not possibly. She <==
picked up the telephone, got put through to Telegrams, and dictated a
brief, snappy message to her long-suffering agent. "Tell Bootle I
absolutely refuse introduce love-interest--Vane."

After that she felt better, but the novel was perfectly impossible.

Antoine would charge himself with all that and would, if Miss Vane
desired it, call for her and accompany her to the Winter Gardens. It was
most good of M. Antoine. On the contrary, it was a pleasure; in a
quarter of an hour's time, then? _Parfaitement._

==> "Tell me, M. Antoine," said Harriet, as their taxi rolled along the <==
Esplanade. "You who are a person of great experience, is love, in your
opinion, a matter of the first importance?"

"It is, alas! of a great importance, mademoiselle, but of the first
importance, no!"

many people who have clean blood and strong bodies spoiling themselves
and distorting their brains with drugs and drink and foolishness, it
makes me angry. They should leave that to the people who cannot help
themselves because to them life is without hope."

==> Harriet hardly knew what to reply; the words were spoken with such <==
personal and tragic significance. Rather fortunately, Antoine did not
wait.

"_L'amour!_ These ladies come and dance and excite themselves and want
love and think it is happiness. And they tell me about their

my faculties, I will make a life for myself? No. They say, Give me
cocaine, give me the cocktail, give me the thrill, give me my gigolo,
give me _l'amo-o-ur_! Like a _mouton_ bleating in a field. If they
knew!"

==> Harriet laughed. <==

"You're right, M. Antoine. I don't believe _l'amour_ matters so
terribly, after all."

"But understand me," said Antoine who, like most Frenchmen, was

important. It is no doubt agreeable to love, and to marry an amiable
person who will give you fine, healthy children. This Lord Peter Wimsey,
_par exemple_, who is obviously a gentleman of the most perfect
integrity----"

==> "Oh, never mind _him_!" broke in Harriet, hastily. "I wasn't thinking <==
about him. I was thinking about Paul Alexis and these people we are
going to see."

"Ah! _c'est différent_. Mademoiselle, I think you know very well the
difference between love which is important and love which is not

"I hope you're not thinking of anything of the sort."

"Oh, I shall kill myself one of these days," said Antoine, cheerfully.
"But it will not be for love. No. I am not so _détraqué_ as all that."

==> The taxi drew up at the Winter Gardens. Harriet felt a certain delicacy <==
about paying the fare, but soon realised that for Antoine the thing was
a commonplace. She accompanied him to the orchestra entrance where, in a
few minutes' time, they were joined by Leila Garland and Luis da
Soto--the perfect platinum blonde and the perfect lounge-lizard. Both
were perfectly self-possessed and incredibly polite; the only

about paying the fare, but soon realised that for Antoine the thing was
a commonplace. She accompanied him to the orchestra entrance where, in a
few minutes' time, they were joined by Leila Garland and Luis da
Soto--the perfect platinum blonde and the perfect lounge-lizard. Both
were perfectly self-possessed and incredibly polite; the only
==> difficulty--as Harriet found when they were seated together at a <==
table--was to get any reliable information out of them. Leila had
evidently taken up an attitude, and stuck to it. Paul Alexis was "a
terribly nice boy," but "too romantic altogether." Leila had been
"terribly grieved" to send him away, he "took it so terribly hard"--but,
after all, her feeling for him had been no more than pity--he had been

expect me to swallow _that_ story, you're expecting a lot,' I said. But
he wouldn't tell me, and of course, that did make a little coolness
between us. I mean to say, when a girl is friends with a man, like me
and Paul, she does expect a little consideration."

==> "Of course she does," said Harriet, warmly. "It was very wrong of him <==
not to be perfectly frank with you. I really think, in your place, I'd
have felt justified in trying to find out who the letters were from."

Leila played delicately with a piece of bread.

"It sounds like a cipher," suggested Antoine.

"Yes, that's just what I thought. I did think it was terribly funny."

==> "But surely," said Harriet, "an ordinary blackmailer wouldn't write <==
letters in cipher."

"Oh, but why shouldn't they? I mean, they might have been a gang, you
know, like in that story, _The Trail of the Purple Python_. Have you
read it? The Purple Python was a Turkish millionaire, and he had a

"You bet they are," said Mr. da Soto. "You're just dead right, sweetest.
They have to be, or they wouldn't be bothered with naughty little
girlies like you."

==> "Yes, but the letters," said Harriet, sticking desperately to her point. <==
"How often did they come?"

"About once a week, sometimes oftener. He kept them locked up in a
little box. He used to answer them, too. Sometimes when I went round to
see him, he'd have his door locked, and old Ma Lefranc said he was

     "_Mais si quelqu'un venoit de la part de Cassandre,_
     _Ouvre-luy tost la porte, et ne le fais attendre,_
     _Soudain entre dans ma chambre, et me vien accoustrer._"

==> Harriet smiled back at him and then, struck with an idea, asked Leila: <==

"When did the last of these letters arrive?"

"I don't know. I wasn't friends with him any more after I got friendly
with Luis. But I expect Ma Lefranc would tell you. There isn't much goes

[line number in individual story] matching line = 7317    window = 7312 7322

"I don't know. I wasn't friends with him any more after I got friendly
with Luis. But I expect Ma Lefranc would tell you. There isn't much goes
on that Ma Lefranc doesn't know about."

"Did you and Alexis live together when you were friendly?" demanded
==> Harriet, bluntly. <==

"Of course not; what a dreadful thing to ask a girl."

"I mean, in the same house."


[line number in individual story] matching line = 7351    window = 7346 7356

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 68247    window = 68242 68252


girls like I."

"Ain't she the snail's ankles?" asked Mr. da Soto, admiringly.

There seemed to be no further information to be gathered from Leila
==> Garland, whom Harriet put down in her own mind as "a regular little <==
gold-digger and as vain as a monkey." As for da Soto, he looked harmless
enough, and did not seem to have had any pressing reason for doing away
with Alexis. One never knew, of course, with these slinky people of
confused nationality. Just as she was thinking this, da Soto drew out
his watch.

[line number in individual story] matching line = 7375    window = 7370 7380

would not have emphasised the crucial time to that extent. They had
agreed that the less anybody knew about the time the better--it would be
helpful in the inquiry if anyone were to come forward ostentatiously
flourishing an alibi for two o'clock.

==> Harriet returned with Antoine, still not quite knowing what to make of <==
da Soto. It was still only a quarter past two; she had time to carry out
a new plan which she had formed. She put some clothes in a suit-case and
went round to interview Paul Alexis' landlady, Mrs. Lefranc.

The door of the cheap-looking lodging-house was opened to her by an

[line number in individual story] matching line = 7386    window = 7381 7391

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 68282    window = 68277 68287


ample personage with brazen hair, who was dressed in a pink wrapper,
much-laddered artificial silk stockings and green velvet mules, and wore
about her heavily powdered neck a string of synthetic-amber beads like
pigeon's eggs.

==> "Good morning," said Harriet, "I'm looking for a room." <==

The lady eyed her shrewdly and said:

"Professional, dearie?"


[line number in individual story] matching line = 7394    window = 7389 7399

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 68290    window = 68285 68295



"Professional, dearie?"

To say "Yes" was tempting but unsafe. Mrs. Lefranc looked as though what
she did not know about professionals could have been written on a
==> threepenny bit. Besides, Harriet was becoming well-known in <==
Wilvercombe--she could scarcely hope to hide her identity for ever.

"No," she said. "I write books. In fact, Mrs. Lefranc, I'm the person
who found poor Mr. Alexis last week. I've been staying at the
Resplendent, but it's terribly expensive, and I thought, if your room

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 68302    window = 68297 68307



"Well, there!" said Mrs. Lefranc. She opened the door a little wider,
but seemed to be divided between suspicion and curiosity. "Well, there!
I hardly know what to say. You ain't one of these journalists?"

==> "Oh, dear, no," replied Harriet. <==

"Because," said Mrs. Lefranc, "with those fellers you never know where
you are. Worried to death I've been with them, poking their long noses
into my private affairs. But of course _you_ can't help but feel an
interest, dearie, can you, seeing it was you that found him, poor boy.

[line number in individual story] matching line = 7463    window = 7458 7468

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 68359    window = 68354 68364


saying, if you don't care about the books I'll take them away. I'm not
going to have that Weldon woman or Leila Garland--the little cat--coming
here trying to get hold of them."

The room was pleasant enough--large and airy and much cleaner than
==> Harriet could have hoped from Mrs. Lefranc's appearance. The furniture <==
was, of course, hideous, but, though shabby, solid and in good order.
The books were just as Inspector Umpelty had described them: mainly
novels in cheap editions, with some Russian paper-backs and a few
volumes of Russian Court memoirs. The only striking relic of the former
tenant was a very beautiful little ikon hung at the head of the

[line number in individual story] matching line = 7471    window = 7466 7476

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 68367    window = 68362 68372


novels in cheap editions, with some Russian paper-backs and a few
volumes of Russian Court memoirs. The only striking relic of the former
tenant was a very beautiful little ikon hung at the head of the
bed--certainly old and probably valuable.

==> For form's sake Harriet entered upon a long haggle with Mrs. Lefranc <==
about terms, emerging victorious with an inclusive charge of two and a
half guineas per week, or twelve shillings and find yourself.

"And it's not everybody I'd do that for," said Mrs. Lefranc. "Only I can
see you're one of the quiet sort. If there's a thing I don't want in my

prince, he had. I'm sure, many's the time when I was run off my feet
with the girl and the lodgers and all, he'd say, 'Cheer up, ma'--they
all call me that, 'cheer up, ma. Have a little cocktail with me and
here's to better days.' Just like a son he was to me, I'm sure."

==> Whatever Harriet may have thought of this touching reminiscence, which <==
sounded quite unlike anything she had heard of Paul Alexis, she did not
ignore the hint.

"How about a spot of something now?" she suggested.


[line number in individual story] matching line = 7503    window = 7498 7508

end sweet of you, dearie, but I couldn't touch anything this time in the
day. Not but what there's the jug-and-bottle at the Dragon just round
the corner, which comes very convenient, and there's no doubt as a drop
of gin do help your dinner to settle."

==> Harriet bent her energies to overcoming the resistance of Mrs. Lefranc, <==
who presently put her head over the staircase and called to "the girl"
to slip round to the Dragon for a suitable quantity of gin.

"They know me," she added, with a wink. "What with these ridiculous laws
about bottles and half-bottles, if they don't know you, they'd get you

days I'll show you my newspaper critiques. Airy-fairy-Lilian they used
to call me when I was principal boy in old Rosenbaum's shows, though you
mightn't think it to look at me now, dearie, for my figure's spread a
bit, there ain't no denying."

==> Harriet admired and sympathised, and led Mrs. Lefranc gently back to the <==
subject of the foreign letters.

"Well, dearie, there was one of them come two days before this dreadful
thing happened. It must have been a long one, for he was shut up hours
and hours with it. Working out his position, he used to call it. Well,

blowing her nose, "life's a funny thing and you can't account for it,
can you? Let's be happy while we can. We'll all be having a little white
stone over us before long and it don't matter so much how or when. When
was you wanting to take the room, dearie?"

==> "I'll be coming in to-night," said Harriet. "I don't know whether I'll <==
want my board or not, but if I leave my suit-case and pay you the twelve
shillings for the room in advance, that'll be all right, won't it?"

"That's O.K., dearie," said Mrs. Lefranc, obviously cheered. "Just you
come when you like, you'll be happy with Ma Lefranc. There, now, you'll

==> If either Harriet Vane or Lord Peter Wimsey felt any embarrassment at <==
meeting again after their burst of free speech, they did not show it.
Both had a story to tell, and were thus spared the awkwardness of being
gravelled for lack of matter.

"Fishers of men, I fancy," replied Wimsey, grimly. "It's Umpelty and his
merry men. Pass me the field glasses, Bunter. Yes. They look very busy.
They've got the drags out. Have a squint."

==> He passed the glasses to Harriet, who exclaimed: <==

"They're hauling something up. It must be pretty heavy. The Inspector's
lending a hand one of the men is hanging on at the other end for dear
life to trim the boat. Oh, oh! you didn't see that. What a pity!

"Don't be silly. They're pulling away like anything. There's something
black just showing----"

"Here! Let's have a look."

==> Harriet surrendered the glasses. They were Wimsey's, after all, though <==
if he thought that she would be upset by a distant view of what she had
once seen so unpleasantly close----

Wimsey looked and began to laugh.


[line number in individual story] matching line = 7757    window = 7752 7762

To walk along a solitary shore with one's heart's idol in the calm of a
summer's afternoon may be classed as an agreeable occupation; but it
loses much of its charm when the couple have to proceed, separated by
the whole width of the beach, searching with backs bent double and eyes
fixed on the ground for something which neither can define and which in
==> all probability is not there. Harriet, mystified, but resolutely <==
believing that Wimsey had some idea in his mind, kept steady to her job;
Wimsey, though he searched carefully, paused a good many times to scan
sea and shore, and appeared to be computing distances and memorising
landmarks. Each explorer carried a satchel in which to store
treasure-trove, and the conversation, such as it was, rather resembled

sideshow attached to a detective investigation."

"I think you are a little intoxicated by the excitement of the

"Naturally. Didn't you?"

"No--I never thought about it."

==> Harriet was silent. She suddenly saw Wimsey in a new light. She knew him <==
to be intelligent, clean, courteous, wealthy, well-read, amusing and
enamoured, but he had not so far produced in her that crushing sense of
utter inferiority which leads to prostration and hero-worship. But she
now realised that there was, after all, something god-like about him. He
could control a horse. She had a fleeting vision of him, very sleek,

"H'm. Yes. I think we'll do the rest by horse-power. I can't see the
coast-road from here, but we shall probably find the faithful Bunter in
attendance not very far off. We can't hope to find anything more along
here. Two horseshoes would be a work of supererogation."

==> Harriet heartily welcomed this decision. <==

"We needn't crawl up the cliff," Wimsey went on. "We'll turn up and get
to the road by the lane. We'll chuck the Bible and the boot--I don't
think they'll get us anywhere."

but he has seen his best days and has hardly got class enough for our
work. The jolly little bay cob rather takes my fancy. Coo-op, pretty,"
said Wimsey, advancing delicately across the field, shaking the oats in
the hat. "Coo-op, coo-op."

==> Harriet had often wondered how people ever managed to catch horses in <==
large fields. It seemed so silly of the creatures to allow themselves to
be taken--and indeed, she remembered distinctly having once stayed in a
country rectory where it always took at least an hour for "the boy" to
catch the pony, with the result that the pony-trap frequently failed to
catch the train. Possibly "the boy" had not gone the right way about it,

stooped, passing his palm down the off-fore leg. The hoof came
obediently up into his hand, while the muzzle went round and gently
nibbled his ear.

Harriet edged round to his side and stared at the hoof.

"New shoe." He put the foot down and reached in turn for the other legs.

"Better get on with it. Suppose the farmer comes."

"How right you are!" He gave the halter a shake and cantered off.

absently in and out, with her eyes on the flying figure.

"Allow me, miss."

Bunter held out his hand for the hat; she relinquished it with a little

The smith was at work. The cheerful clink of his hammer fell cheerily on
their ears as they crossed the green, and the huge dappled quarters of a
cart-horse gleamed in the shaft of sunlight that fell across the open

"Afternoon, zur," said the yokel in charge of the cart-horse, civilly.

In the mood of relaxation and confidence that follows on being
parboiled, it was easy enough to pump Mrs. Weldon. A little diplomacy
was needed, so as not to betray the ulterior object of the inquiry, but
no detective could have had a more unsuspecting victim. The matter
==> proved to be very much as Harriet had supposed. <==

Mrs. Weldon was the only daughter of a wealthy brewer, who had left her
a very considerable fortune in her own right. Her parents having died
when she was a child, she had been brought up by a strict Nonconformist
aunt in the little town of St. Ives in Huntingdonshire. She had been

[line number in individual story] matching line = 8422    window = 8417 8427

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 69318    window = 69313 69323


suitable, though not brilliant; but she had shown sufficient business
ability to insist that her niece's money should be tied up in such a
manner that Weldon could not touch the capital. Weldon, to do him
justice, had made no objection to this. He seemed to have been a
perfectly honest, sober and industrious man, farming his land thriftily
==> and well and having, so far as Harriet could make out, no drawbacks <==
beyond a certain lack of imagination in matrimonial matters.

Henry was the only child of the marriage, and had been brought up from
the beginning with the idea that he was to follow in his father's
footsteps, and here again, Weldon senior took a very proper view of the

[line number in individual story] matching line = 8467    window = 8462 8472

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 69363    window = 69358 69368


relations had been strained until the death of Alexis had urged the
lonely woman to seek comfort in the ties of blood. Henry had come,
expressed contrition for his former waywardness, received forgiveness
and shown that he was, after all, her loving son.

==> Harriet mentioned Mrs. Lefranc's theory that Alexis had committed <==
suicide owing to the failure of unknown and important "speculations."
Mrs. Weldon scouted the theory.

"What could it matter to him, my dear? Paul knew perfectly well that
when we were married I should settle my money on him--with the

[line number in individual story] matching line = 8506    window = 8501 8511

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 69402    window = 69397 69407


which would have been about £100,000 altogether, including his own
£30,000. Because, you see, Paul might have married again and had a
family, and then he would need the money. I don't see that there was
anything unfair about that, do you?"

==> Harriet felt that a great deal might be said about an arrangement which <==
cut off the only son with the life-interest on £30,000, with reversion
to a young step-father, and left full control of over three times that
sum to the step-father; and which also placed the hypothetical family of
the son in a vastly inferior position to the equally hypothetical
children of the step-father by a hypothetical new wife. Still, Mrs.

"Oh, yes," said Mrs. Weldon. "At least, it will do so. I must confess
that I have been a little remiss up to the present. I haven't actually
made a will. I have always enjoyed such wonderful health--but it will
have to be done, of course. You know how one puts things off."

==> The old story, thought Harriet. If all the wise wills projected in <==
people's minds were actually executed, there would be fewer fortunes
inherited only to be thrown away. She reflected that if Mrs. Weldon died
the next day, Henry would step into sole control of something over
£130,000.


[line number in individual story] matching line = 8552    window = 8547 8557

without capital, can you? Money breeds money, as a stockbroker I once
knew used to say, and Paul never had any money to start with. I don't
think he would have known anything about speculating either; he was too
romantic and unworldly, poor dear boy."

==> "Maybe," said Harriet to herself, "maybe. But he managed to get on the <==
right side of the person who had it." She was a little surprised.
"Wealthy" is a comparative term--she had imagined Mrs. Weldon to possess
about three thousand a year. But if her money was decently invested--and
she spoke as if it was--she must have at least twice that amount. A
pauper like Alexis might be excused for wedding £130,000 at whatever

"What a curious face that Monsieur Antoine has," she was saying, "he
seems to be a nice young man, though I'm sure he is far from robust. He
spoke most kindly to me yesterday about Paul. He seems to have been very
much attached to him, sincerely so."

==> "Oh, Antoine!" thought Harriet, a little reproachfully. Then she <==
remembered the mad mother and the imbecile brother and thought instead,
"Poor Antoine!" But the thought was still an unpleasant one.

"It's all very well for Lord Peter," she grumbled to herself, "_he's_
never wanted for anything." Why Lord Peter should be brought into the

containing the substance of her conversation with Mrs. Weldon. He
frowned over it for a moment and then abruptly summoned Bunter.

Huntingdonshire."

==> On leaving the Turkish baths, Miss Harriet Vane went out on a shopping <==
expedition. This was her second venture of the kind since her arrival in
Wilvercombe, and on both occasions her purchases were dictated by the
desire of pleasing a man. On this occasion, she wanted an afternoon
frock. And why? She was going out for a picnic.

Henry seemed gratified by the efforts made to please him, and by Miss
Vane's openly expressed admiration of his driving. This was of a showy
and ill-tempered kind, and involved "putting the wind up" other users of
==> the road. Harriet had herself driven cars, and suffered as all drivers <==
do when being driven, but even when Henry rounded a corner very wide at
fifty miles an hour and crammed a motor-cyclist into the ditch, she
merely remarked (with some truth) that the speed made her feel quite
nervous.

"Oh, nothing. Don't want to be rude to a friend of yours. I say, what's

"Yes?"

something for me."

"Of course, I'd do anything I could."

"That's nice of you. Do persuade this Wimsey fellow to drop it. As long

"Yes, I see. I quite understand. I'll do my best."

"Good girl!" Henry patted her encouragingly on the thigh. "I knew you
and I'd get on like a house on fire together."

==> Harriet smiled. <==

"I don't know if I shall be able to persuade him. He doesn't like taking
advice. You know what men are."

"I bet _you_ know all right. I don't suppose there's much you don't

"You mustn't talk like that."

"Mustn't I? Can't help it. You've got a way with you--haven't you, eh?"

==> Harriet wished that he would not say "eh?" so often. And she disliked <==
the grossness of his voice and the coarseness of his skin and the little
tufts of hair in his ears.

"Don't drive with one hand like that--suppose anything came along
suddenly."

"I should enjoy that."

No--Henry was really too easy. Surely even his colossal vanity could not
suppose that he had really made a conquest. Yet there he sat, smiling
==> away and almost audibly purring. No doubt he thought that Harriet Vane <==
was any man's game. He really imagined that, placed between Lord Peter
and himself, a woman could possibly--well, why not? How was he to know?
It wouldn't be the first time that a woman had made a foolish choice. If
anything, he was paying her the compliment of supposing that she was not
mercenary. Or, horrid thought, did he expect her to be completely

This reminder had its effect, and Henry "behaved himself" until their
arrival at the spot selected for the picnic compelled him to return to
his former attitude of ordinary politeness.

The picnic itself passed off without any remarkable incident, and Henry
==> did not succeed in getting Harriet to himself until the meal was over <==
and they went to wash up the plates in a little brook that ran close by.
Even then, Harriet was able to avoid his advances by sending him to do
the washing while she stood by with a dish-cloth. She ordered him about
prettily and he obeyed with delighted willingness, tucking up his
sleeves and getting down to the job. However, the inevitable moment

wriggled, pushing his arms away and bending her head down, so that the
faithful and long-suffering hat was between them.

"Damn it!" said Henry. "You might let a fellow----"

==> It was then that Harriet became really frightened. She gave a scream <==
which was no mockery, but a really determined yell, and followed it up
with a box on the ear that was no butterfly kiss. Henry, astonished,
relaxed his grasp for a moment. She broke away from him--and at that
moment Mrs. Weldon, attracted by the scream, came running to the top of
the bank.

moment Mrs. Weldon, attracted by the scream, came running to the top of
the bank.

"Whatever is the matter?"

==> "I saw a snake!" said Harriet, wildly. "I'm sure it was a viper." <==

She screamed again, and so did Mrs. Weldon, who was terrified of snakes.
Henry, grunting, picked up the fallen plates and told his mother not to
be silly.

"Come back to the car," said Mrs. Weldon. "I won't stay another moment
in this horrid place."

They went back to the car. Henry looked glum and injured; he felt that
==> he had been badly treated, as indeed he had. But Harriet's face was <==
white enough to show that she had had a real shock, and she insisted on
returning in the back of the car with Mrs. Weldon, who made a great fuss
over her with a smelling-bottle and ejaculations of horror and sympathy.

When they got back to Wilvercombe, Harriet was sufficiently recovered to

thank Henry properly and apologise for having been so stupid. But she
was still not quite herself, refused to come in to the hotel and
insisted on walking back to her room at Mrs. Lefranc's. She would not
allow Henry to go with her--she wouldn't hear of it--she was quite all
right--the walk would do her good. Henry, who was still offended, did

==> not press the point. Harriet walked away, but not to Mrs. Lefranc's. She <==
hastened to the nearest telephone-cabinet and rang up the Bellevue. Was
Lord Peter Wimsey there? No, he was out; could they take a message? Yes.
Would he please come round and see Miss Vane at once, the minute he came
in? It was frightfully urgent. Certainly they would tell him. No, they
would not forget.

Alexis' ikon. She really felt quite upset.

She had sat there for an hour, without removing her hat and
gloves--just thinking, when there was a commotion on the staircase. Feet
came up two steps at a time and the door burst open so hard upon the

"Hullo-ullo-ullo! Here we all are. What's up? Anything exciting? So
sorry I was out----Here! I say! Hold up! It's all right, you know--at
least, it _is_ all right, isn't it?"

==> He gently extricated his arm from Harriet's frenzied grasp and shut the <==
door.

"Now then! My dear, what's happened? You're all of a doodah!"

"Peter! I believe I've been kissed by a murderer."

"Haviland Martin?"

"Haviland Martin."

Wimsey walked very deliberately to a table near the window, laid down
==> his hat and stick upon it, drew forward a chair, placed Harriet in it, <==
drew up a second chair, sat down in it himself, and said:

"You win. I am astonished. I am thunderstruck. Kindly explain yourself.
I thought you were out this afternoon with the Weldons."

"Only in the interests of justice. Besides, I boxed his ears."

"Go on. Begin from the beginning."

==> Harriet began from the beginning. Wimsey bore fairly well the story of <==
the vamping of Henry Weldon, merely interjecting that he hoped the man
wouldn't make himself a nuisance later on, and listened patiently till
she came to the incident of the plate-washing.

"I was sort of wriggling--because I didn't want him actually to kiss me,

[line number in individual story] matching line = 9261    window = 9256 9266

that."

"So he could. And his hair looks as if it had been dyed recently, for
the matter of that, and re-bleached. I thought it looked funny and dead.
Well, if Weldon is Martin, there's undoubtedly some funny business
==> somewhere. But Harriet, do put it out of your mind that he's a murderer. <==
We've proved that Martin couldn't possibly have done it. He couldn't get
to the place in time. Had you forgotten that?"

"Yes--I believe I had forgotten it. It seemed so obvious, somehow, that
if he was there at Darley, in disguise, he must have been up to

actual murderer, why was he at Darley at all?"

"Goodness knows!"

"Something to do with the bay mare, that's a certainty. But what? What
==> was the point of the bay mare at all? It beats me, Harriet; it beats <==
me."

"So it does me."

"Well, there's only one thing to do."

FRIDAY, 26 JUNE

The inquest upon the body of Paul Alexis was held on June 26th, to the
undisguised relief and triumph of Inspector Umpelty. For years (it
seemed to him) he had been trying to make an investigation about nothing
==> tangible. But for Harriet's photographs, he might, in his more worried <==
moments, have begun to think that the body was a myth. Now, however,
here it definitely was: a real, solid--or comparatively solid--body.
True, it was not quite so informative as he had hoped. It was not served
out to him complete with a ticket, marked in plain figures: "Suicide,
with care," or "This Year's Murder-Model; Body by Bright." However,

[line number in individual story] matching line = 10330    window = 10325 10335

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 71226    window = 71221 71231



This, naturally, focused public attention on Mrs. Weldon. Henry handed
her a smelling-bottle and said something to her, and she responded by a
faint smile.

==> The next witness was Harriet Vane, who gave a detailed account of the <==
finding of the body. The coroner examined her particularly in the matter
of the exact position of the body and the condition of the blood.
Harriet was a good witness on these points, her training as a
mystery-writer having taught her to assemble details of this kind
coherently.

[line number in individual story] matching line = 10333    window = 10328 10338

"The body was lying with the knees drawn up, as though it had crumpled
together in that position as it fell. The clothes were not disarranged

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 71273    window = 71268 71278



The coroner said he did not think the jury could possibly blame Miss
Vane for not having tried to remove the corpse, and complimented her on
the presence of mind she had shown in taking photographs and carrying
out investigations. The photographs were handed to the jury, and, after
==> Harriet had explained the various difficulties she had encountered <==
before getting into communication with the police, she was allowed to
step down.

The next witness was the police-surgeon, Dr. Fenchurch. From his
examination of the photographs and of the body, he had formed the

[line number in individual story] matching line = 10459    window = 10454 10464

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 71355    window = 71350 71360



"Certainly. A soporific might have been administered beforehand in order
to make the attack more easy."

Here Inspector Umpelty rose and begged to draw the coroner's attention
==> to the evidence of Harriet and the photographs that the deceased had <==
walked to the rock on his own feet and alone.

"Thank you, Inspector; we shall come to that later. Permit me to finish
with the medical evidence. You heard Miss Vane's account of her finding
the body, Doctor, and her statement that at ten minutes past two the

Free-Trader and member of the Public Health Committee.

Mr. Pollock was then called. He admitted having been in the
neighbourhood of the Grinders reef with his boat at about two o'clock on
the day of the death, but insisted that he had been out in deep water
==> and had seen nothing previous to Harriet's arrival on the scene. He was <==
not looking in that direction; he had his own business to attend to. As
to the nature of that business he remained evasive, but nothing could
shake his obstinate assertion of complete ignorance. His grandson Jem
(having now returned from Ireland) briefly confirmed this evidence, but
added that he himself had surveyed the shore with a glass at, he

Bolsheviks, which there was not an atom of testimony to support.

Wimsey grinned at Umpelty over this convenient summary, with its useful
suppressions and assumptions. No mention of clefts in the rock or of
horseshoes or of the disposal of Mrs. Weldon's money. The jury whispered
==> together. There was a pause. Harriet looked at Henry Weldon. He was <==
frowning heavily and paying no attention to his mother, who was talking
excitedly into his ear.

Presently the foreman rose to his feet--a stout person, who looked like
a farmer.

[line number in individual story] matching line = 10892    window = 10887 10897

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 71788    window = 71783 71793


Then, suddenly, illumination came flooding, stabbing across the dark
places of his mind like a searchlight. And, good God! if this was the
true solution, Weldon was anything but a fool. He was one of the
subtlest criminals a detective had ever encountered. Wimsey studied
Weldon's obstinate profile--was it possible? Yes, it was possible--and
==> the scheme might quite well have been successful, if only Harriet Vane <==
had not turned up with her evidence.

Work it out this way; see how it looked. Weldon had murdered Alexis at
the Flat-Iron at two o'clock. He had had the mare tethered ready
somewhere, and, after leaving the Feathers at 1.30, he had gone down the

[line number in individual story] matching line = 10905    window = 10900 10910

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 71801    window = 71796 71806


twenty-five minutes. That would leave him half a mile from the Flat-Iron
at two o'clock. No, that would not do. Strain it a little farther. Let
him start from Hinks's Lane at 1.32 and let him wallop a steady nine
miles an hour out of the mare--that would almost do it. Let him, in any
case, be within five minutes' quick walk of the rock at 1.55. Then what?
==> _He sends the mare home._ Five minutes before Harriet woke, he could <==
send the bay mare galloping back along the sands. Then he walks. He
reaches the Flat-Iron at two o'clock. He kills. He hears Harriet coming.
He hides in the cleft of the rock. And meanwhile, the bay mare has
either run home, or, possibly, has reached the lane by the cottages and
run up it, or----

The times were tight; the whole thing seemed absurdly elaborate, but it
was not an absolute impossibility as he had thought at first. Suppose it
==> had been so. Now, if Harriet had not been there, what would have <==
happened? In a few hours the tide would have covered the body. Pause
there, Morocco. If Weldon was the murderer, he would not want the body
lost. He would want his mother to know that Alexis was dead. Yes; but
under ordinary circumstances the body would have turned up sooner. It
was the violent south-west wind and the three hundred sovereigns that

lost. He would want his mother to know that Alexis was dead. Yes; but
under ordinary circumstances the body would have turned up sooner. It
was the violent south-west wind and the three hundred sovereigns that
had combined to keep the body hidden. And the body had been found, even
==> so. Well, then. If Harriet had not found the body when she did, there <==
would have been nothing to show that the death had not occurred
earlier--say between 11 and 1.30--the period for which there was the
alibi. In fact, the victim's arrival at that early hour at Darley Halt
made it look much more likely that the earlier hour was the right one.
Why should you tempt your victim to a lonely spot at 11.30 a.m. and then

structure had collapsed under the shock of her evidence. That must have

think this thing over.

A little concentration in the privacy of his own room brought him to a
point from which he could begin to work forward with some assurance.

He might do nothing. That would be the safest way of all. He might rely

defence, which would be, what? Undoubtedly, an alibi for two
o'clock--the real time of the murder.

herself giving it a very divided attention. Compared with the remarkable

to handing the problem over in this way to the clarifying action of the

clear and refused quite definitely to deal with the matter of the
town-clock. Under such circumstances it is admittedly useless to ask the
conscious to take any further steps. When she ought to have been
writing, Harriet would sit comfortably in an armchair, reading a volume
taken from Paul Alexis' bookshelf, with the idea of freeing the

remarkable amount of miscellaneous information about the Russian
Imperial Court and a still more remarkable amount of romantic narrative
about love and war in Ruritanian states. Paul Alexis had evidently had a

the matter. The rise and fall of governments appeared to be a private
arrangement, comfortably thrashed out among a selection of small Balkan
States, vaguely situated and acknowledging no relationships outside the
domestic circle. No literature could have been better suited for the
release of the sub-conscious; nevertheless, the sub-conscious
==> obstinately refused to work. Harriet groaned in spirit and turned to <==
crosswords, with the aid of Chambers' Dictionary--that Bible of the
crossword fan--which she found wedged in between a paper-covered book
printed in Russian and _A Bid for the Throne_.

Lord Peter Wimsey had also found something to read, which was occupying

fully reported, with photographs, in the National Press, and the
dinner-tables of the Resplendent were so crowded that evening that it
became necessary to serve a supplementary dinner in the Louis Quinze
Saloon.

==> "I suppose you will be leaving Wilvercombe now," said Harriet to Mrs. <==
Weldon. "It will always have sad memories for you."

"Indeed, my dear, I shall not. I intend to stay here until the cloud is
lifted from Paul's memory. I know positively that he was murdered by a
Soviet gang and it's simply a disgrace that the police should let this

hear about this gentleman, nevertheless. The Gentleman was wearing
horn-rimmed spectacles and he came up the lane "somewhere between
half-past three and four," and went straight off along the road towards
Lesston Hoe. This must, of course, have been Perkins, and brief
calculation showed that this time fitted in reasonably well both with
==> his own story and Harriet's. Harriet had met him about half-a-mile <==
further on at four o'clock. But that proved nothing, and the crucial
period between 1.30 and three o'clock remained as obscure as before.

Puzzled and dissatisfied, Ormond chugged slowly back to Darley, noticing
as he went how little of the beach could actually be seen from the road.

But he might have argued that this would not greatly matter if it was at
some distance from the Flat-Iron. It might just be worth while to turn
back and examine the shore from that point of view.

He did so, riding right up as far as the Flat-Iron itself, scrambling
==> down by the same path that Harriet had used, and working his way along <==
at the foot of the cliff in the direction of Darley. After about
half-an-hour's search, he found what he was looking for. There was a
recess in the cliff where at some time there had been a fall of rock.
Jammed in among the boulders was a large wooden post, which had
apparently formed part of a fence--erected, no doubt, to keep men or

hand. He fretted, was short with his wife, trod on the cat, and decided
to go round to the Bellevue and look up Lord Peter Wimsey.

Wimsey was out, and a little further inquiry led Glaisher to Mrs.
Lefranc's, where he found, not only Wimsey, but also Inspector Umpelty,
==> seated with Harriet in the bed-sitting-room that had once housed Paul <==
Alexis, all three apparently engaged in a Missing Word Competition.
Books were strewn about the place, and Harriet, with _Chambers's
Dictionary_ in her hand, was reading out words to her companions.

Umpelty grunted. Wimsey took a map and a sheet of paper and began
figuring out distances and times. They discussed it. They argued about
the speed of the mare. Wimsey was inclined to think that he might have
underestimated it. He would borrow the animal--make a test----

==> Harriet said nothing. <==

"And what do _you_ think?" Wimsey asked her, suddenly.

"I don't believe a word of it," said Harriet.

Glaisher laughed.

"Miss Vane's intuition, as they call it, is against it," said he.

==> "It's not intuition," retorted Harriet. "There's no such thing. It's <==
common sense. It's artistic sense, if you like. All those
theories--they're all wrong. They're artificial--they smell of the
lamp."

Glaisher laughed again.

Glaisher laughed again.

"That's beyond me, that is."

these figures and time-tables and you've lost sight of what you're
really dealing with. But it's all machine-made. It creaks at every
joint. It's like--like a bad plot, built up round an idea that won't
work. You've got it into your heads that you must get Weldon and the
horse and Perkins into it somehow or other, and when you come up against

course, his getting knocked down and laid up like that must have puzzled
his accomplices just as much as it puzzled us. There may be a whole
correspondence waiting for him at some accommodation address, under
another name, in some town or other."

==> "You will insist on its being Perkins," protested Harriet. "You really <==
think Perkins rode a horse bare-backed along the beach and cut a man's
throat to the bone with a razor?"

"Why not?" said Umpelty.

"'Do I look like it? said the Knave. Which he certainly did not, being
made entirely of cardboard.' I've never seen the bloke, but I admit that
his description isn't encouraging." Wimsey grinned. "But then, you know,
friend Henry took _me_ for something in the night-club line."

==> Harriet glanced briefly at his lean limbs and springy build. <==

"You needn't fish," she said, coldly. "We all know that your appearance
of languor is assumed and that you are really capable of tying pokers
into knots with your artistic fingers. Perkins is flabby and has a neck
like a chicken and those flip-flop hands." She turned to Glaisher. "I

"On my charwoman's testimony to my character?"

"Supplemented," said the Superintendent, "by our own observation."

==> "I see." Harriet looked hard at Glaisher, but he was proof against this <==
kind of third degree, and smiled blandly in response. Wimsey, who had
listened with his face like a mask, determined to give the stolid
policeman the first prize for tact. He now dropped a cold comment into
the conversation.

and did the throat-cutting. Which brings us to the point that either
Weldon's party wrote the letters or the foreign party did the murder."

"True, O king."

==> "And where," asked Harriet, "does Olga Kohn come in?" <==

"Ah!" said Wimsey, "there you are. That's the deepest mystery of the
lot. I'll swear that girl was telling the truth, and I'll swear that the
extremely un-Irish Mr. Sullivan was telling the truth too. Little flower
in the crannied wall I pluck you out of the crannies, but, as the poet

"I'm going home to bed," he declared. "We must wait till we get the
photographs of the paper. Life is dust and ashes. I can't prove my
theories and Bunter has deserted me again. He disappeared from
Wilvercombe on the same day as William Bright, leaving me a message to
say that one of my favourite socks had been lost in the wash and that he
==> had lodged a complaint with the management. Miss Vane, Harriet, if I may <==
call you so, will you marry me and look after my socks, and,
incidentally be the only woman-novelist who ever accepted a proposal of
marriage in the presence of a superintendent and inspector of police?"

"Not even for the sake of the headlines."

"Young idiot!" said Wimsey, wrathfully. He threw the letter into the
waste-paper basket, put on his hat and went round to Mrs. Lefranc's.
==> Here he found Harriet industriously at work upon the cipher. She <==
reported, however, total failure.

"I don't think it's a scrap of good going on with these marked words,"
said Wimsey. "And Bungo has failed us. Let's put our great brains to the
business. Now, look here. Here is a problem to start with. What is in

"It does. That means that this letter probably made the appointment for
the meeting at the Flat-Iron. Now why wasn't this letter burnt with the
rest?"

==> Harriet let her mind range over the field of detective fiction, with <==
which she was moderately well acquainted.

"In my own books," she remarked, "I usually make the villain end up by
saying 'Bring this letter with you.' The idea is, from the villain's
point of view, that he can then make certain that the paper is

destroyed. From _my_ point of view, of course, I put it in so that the
villain can leave a fragment of paper clutched in the victim's stiffened
hand to assist Robert Templeton."

"Just so. Now, suppose our villain didn't quite grasp the duplicity of
==> your motives. Suppose he said to himself: 'Harriet Vane and other <==
celebrated writers of mystery fiction always make the murderer tell the
victim to bring the letter with him. That is evidently the correct thing
to do.' That would account for the paper's being here."

"He'd have to be rather an amateur villain."

line with it and also with M."

Wimsey clawed a little at his hair and sat muttering.

"It looks as though we'd sucked our five letters rather dry," said
==> Harriet. "How about trying the rest of the message? I've got it all <==
ready sorted out into pairs. Hullo! Here's our old friend EXMG appearing
again in the body of it."

"Is there?" Wimsey sat up. "Then, if we're right, that will be another
date in June. I can't believe it's part of two words, one of which ends

O and A in the same line, O and H in the same line, and A and B we knew
about before. That looks as though we might be on the right track, but
it doesn't help us much, because none of the letters we've already
placed comes into it."

==> "Just a moment," put in Harriet. "I've got a brainwave. That town in the <==
heading--it's supposed to be something in Central Europe. It's got six
letters, and the last two are the first two reversed. How about Warsaw?"

"By jove! that's bright! We can but try it. Let's see--that gives us
this." He wrote down the new pairs of diagonals.

it in the third line down, because there are only six letters that come
between N and U, and we should have eight spaces left to put them in.
Therefore, if W is rightly placed, N has got to go in the top two lines,
which means that it definitely does belong to the key-word."

and T are correct. And now we know that AR must come next to one another
in the key-word."

"Can't we do something now with NX=AW? Yes--look! If we put A into
either of the squares in Diagram 1, so as to make NX=AW, then A won't
come next to R! So either we're all wrong, or we can wash out Diagram 1
altogether."

have a vowel of some kind between M and N, and that vowel can't be A, E,
I or U, because we've placed those elsewhere. Therefore it's got to be
either O or Y."

"O for preference. The number of words with MYN in them must be limited.

"Well!" said Wimsey. "In all this case, from beginning to end, I only
seem to have got one thing right. I said that the letter would contain

"And Alexis yelled, and you woke up, and he had to hide."

"That's about it. It seems to hang together reasonably well. And that
means we've got to look for a quite new murderer who had an opportunity
of knowing about the appointment between Boris and Alexis. And," added
==> Harriet, hopefully, "it needn't be a Bolshevik. It might be somebody <==
with a private motive for doing away with Alexis. How about the da Soto
gentleman who got the reversion of Leila Garland? Leila may have told
him some nasty story about Alexis."

Wimsey was silent; his thoughts seemed to be wandering. Presently he

It looks like somebody with a very sketchy idea of the way revolutions
really work, trying to flatter that poor boob's monomania about his
birth."

kind of thing I should put into a detective story if I didn't know a
thing about Russia and didn't care much, and only wanted to give a
general idea that somebody was a conspirator."

"I shall hand these over to Glaisher," he said. "They will give him
something to think about. I like to see other people doing a spot of
work from time to time. Do you realise that it's nearly tea-time and we
haven't had any lunch?"

==> "Time passes when one is pleasantly occupied," said Harriet, <==
sententiously.

Wimsey put his hat and papers down on the table, opened his mouth to
speak, changed his mind, took up his belongings again and marched to the
door.

He never was in Wilvercombe. He didn't buy collars. He didn't go to the

"Then the connection won't go too far back. It'll belong to London or

"Oh, is he? That's a description that hides a multitude of sins. Well,
go to it, Superintendent. As for me, I'll have to do something drastic
to restore my self-respect. Seeking the bubble reputation even in the
cannon's mouth."

==> "Oh yeah?" Harriet grinned impishly. "When Lord Peter gets these fits of <==
quotation he's usually on to something."

"Sez you," retorted Wimsey. "I am going, straight away, to make love to
Leila Garland."

Wimsey, making sure that Leila had really told him all she knew,

"But it's simply silly," said that practical young woman when she saw
it. "Even if Alexis' great-great-grandmother had been married to
Nicholas I fifty times over, he wouldn't have been the heir to the
throne. Why, there are heaps and heaps of people nearer than he was--the

evidence--of an elaborate conspiracy to do something or the other. And
we've got a corpse which looks like the victim of a conspiracy to
murder. But when we come to put the two together, they don't fit.
Everything in the garden is lovely except the melancholy fact that none
of the people engaged in the conspiracy could possibly have done the

sort--how do you propose to tackle this one?"

"I don't know," said Harriet. "I can only suggest a few methods and
precedents. There's the Roger Sheringham method, for instance. You prove
elaborately and in detail that A did the murder; then you give the story

explain how he managed to get killed with nobody near him. The real
difficulty----"

"Wait a moment," said Wimsey. "Say that again."

==> Harriet said it again. "The real difficulty," she persisted, "is that <==
one can't see how _anybody_--let alone Morecambe or Henry Weldon--could
have done the murder. Even if Pollock----"

"The real difficulty," interrupted Wimsey, in a suddenly high-pitched
and excited voice, "is the time of the death, isn't it?"

that is that Morecambe's 'Commission Agency' is a pretty vague sort of
affair and uncommonly rocky on its pins. Our idea was that the lady
brought the two men together, and that Morecambe promised to do what he
could for Weldon on a fifty-fifty basis."

==> "Fifty-fifty of what?" asked Harriet. <==

"Of his mother's money--when he raked it in."

"But that wouldn't be till she died."

luring their victim to the Flat-Iron. Immediately after this, the
mysterious letters begin to go out. I wonder, by the way, what was the
excuse for not writing that first letter in Russian. Because, of course,
that must have gone out in clear and not in code."

==> "I've got an idea about that," said Harriet. "Didn't you say you knew of <==
an English novel that had an explanation of the Playfair cipher?"

"Yes--one of John Rhode's. Why?"

"I suggest that the first letter merely gave the title of the book and

and horse-riding part of it, which needed brawn only, while Morecambe
buzzed about despatching letters and photographs and working Alexis up
to the top-notch of excitement. Then, when everything is about ready,
Morecambe goes off to take up his rôle of travelling hairdresser."

==> "But why all that incredible elaboration?" demanded Harriet. "Why didn't <==
they just buy an ordinary razor or knife in an ordinary way? Surely it
would be less traceable."

"You'd think so. In fact, I daresay it might have been. But it's
surprising how things do get traced. Look at Patrick Mahon and the

"Weldon having thoughtfully armed him with the razor for that purpose?"

"Well, yes--I suppose so."

"Ghosts," replied Inspector Umpelty, with a snort of incredulity.
"Anyhow, you can't put horses in the witness-box."

WEDNESDAY, 8 JULY

"Do you mean to say," demanded Inspector Umpelty, with slow indignation,
"that the young lady finds herself mistaken all this time?"

==> Harriet shook her head, and Wimsey said, "No." <==

"Well, my lord, I don't think you can go against the doctor. I've asked
other doctors about it, and they say there's no doubt about it."

"You didn't tell them the whole of the facts," said Wimsey. "I don't

blame you," he added, kindly, "I've only just thought of the rest of the

Suppose we put down a few things we know about this supposed heir of the
Romanovs."

     1. He is known to have been very ill as a child, through being
     knocked down in the playground.

     completely drained of blood.

     11. And, finally, one may inherit other things besides Imperial
     crowns through the female line.

Harriet laughed:

"Of course!" she said. "I thought your style was a little laboured in
places! But as an impromptu effort it's creditable."

"I don't see what you get from all that," said Umpelty. And then,
suspiciously: "Is it a joke? Is it another of these ciphers?" He
snatched up the paper and ran a large thumb down the lines. "Here!" he
said, "what are you playing at? Is it a riddle?"

==> "No, it's the answer," said Harriet. "You're right, Peter, you're <==
right--you must be. It would explain such a lot. Only I didn't know
about antipyrin."

"I'm almost sure that is right; I remember reading about it somewhere."

Hence, if I remember rightly, the antipyrin. And what's more, it
generally ends up by ankylosing your joints and making you a permanent
cripple."

those books of Alexis--but like a fool, I never thought about it in
connection with the murder."

"I don't know that I see it now," said the Inspector, "except that it
explains why Alexis was such a namby-pamby and all that. Do you mean it

characteristic thickening of the joints that accompanies hæmophilia. And
I daresay you might get conclusive evidence by inquiring among the
people who knew Alexis in London and America. I'm pretty sure he had the
disease."

==> "It's funny," said Harriet, "the way all this worked out for Weldon & <==
Co. They had such good luck in one way and such bad luck in another. I
mean: first of all they laid a fairly good plot, which turned on an
alibi and a disguise. Then I came along unexpectedly and busted up the
disguise. That was bad luck. But at the same time I produced a lot of
unnecessary cleverness and observation which gave them a far better

suicide, and we'd better let it go at that. He's as mad as a dog with us
for arresting those people anyhow, and if I come along with this story
about hæmo-what-you-call, he'll have fifty thousand fits. See here, my
lord, if we do prosecute, d'you really think we've a hope in Hades?"

==> "I'll tell you this," said Harriet. "Last night, Mrs. Weldon consented <==
to dance with M. Antoine, and Henry didn't like it at all. If you let
Henry Weldon and Morecambe loose again, what premium would you take on
those two lives--Antoine's and Mrs. Weldon's?"

There was silence after the Inspector left them.

Mrs. Morecambe smiled graciously. Well, Mr. Morecambe was at home, as it

him to come down. Inspector Umpelty indicated that this was not really
