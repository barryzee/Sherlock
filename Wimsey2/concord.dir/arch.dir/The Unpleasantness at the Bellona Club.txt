==> ‘What in the world, Wimsey, are you doing in this Morgue?’ demanded <==
Captain Fentiman, flinging aside the _Evening Banner_ with the air of a
man released from an irksome duty.

the palms and the chaste bronze nude in the corner.’

‘Yes, and look at the corpses. Place always reminds me of that old thing

like that one of these days. I wish to God Jerry had put me out with the
rest of ’em. What’s the good of coming through for this sort of thing?
What’ll you have?’

==> ‘Dry Martini,’ said Wimsey. ‘And you? Two dry Martinis, Fred, please. <==
Cheer up. All this remembrance-day business gets on your nerves, don’t
it? It’s my belief most of us would only be too pleased to chuck these
community hysterics if the beastly newspapers didn’t run it for all it’s
worth. However, it don’t do to say so. They’d hoof me out of the Club if
I raised my voice beyond a whisper.’

I raised my voice beyond a whisper.’

‘They’d do that anyway, whatever you were saying,’ said Fentiman
gloomily. ‘What _are_ you doing here?’

==> ‘Waitin’ for Colonel Marchbanks,’ said Wimsey. ‘Bung-ho!’ <==

‘Dining with him?’

‘Yes.’

‘I don’t mind old Marchbanks,’ he said, after a pause. ‘He’s a dear old
boy.’

‘And how are things going with you?’ he asked.

‘Oh, rotten as usual. Tummy all wrong and no money. What’s the damn good

Fentiman’s voice had risen in nervous excitement. A shocked veteran,
till then invisible in a neighbouring armchair, poked out a lean head

Fentiman’s voice had risen in nervous excitement. A shocked veteran,
till then invisible in a neighbouring armchair, poked out a lean head
like a tortoise and said ‘Sh!’ viperishly.

==> ‘Oh, I wouldn’t do that,’ said Wimsey lightly. ‘Crime’s a skilled <==
occupation, y’know. Even a comparative imbecile like myself can play the
giddy sleuth on the amateur Moriarty. If you’re thinkin’ of puttin’ on a
false moustache and lammin’ a millionaire on the head, don’t do it. That
disgustin’ habit you have of smoking cigarettes down to the last
millimetre would betray you anywhere. I’d only have to come on with a

nearest ashtray.

‘I wonder anybody cares to know you,’ he said. The strain and bitterness
had left his voice and he sounded merely amused.

==> ‘They wouldn’t,’ said Wimsey, ‘only they think I’m too well-off to have <==
any brains. It’s like hearing that the Earl of Somewhere is taking a
leading part in a play. Everybody takes it for granted he must act
rottenly. I’ll tell you my secret. All my criminological investigations
are done for me by a ‘ghost’ at three pounds a week, while I get the
headlines and frivol with well-known journalists at the Savoy.’

the least witty, but you have a kind of obvious facetiousness which
reminds me of the less exacting class of music-hall.’

‘It’s the self-defence of the first-class mind against the superior
person,’ said Wimsey. ‘But, look here, I’m sorry to hear about Sheila. I

‘Damned good of you,’ said Fentiman, ‘but I don’t care to. There’s
honestly not the faintest chance I could ever pay you, and I haven’t
quite got to the point yet—’

another time. Good evening, Colonel.’

‘Evening, Peter. Evening, Fentiman. Beautiful day its been. No—no
cocktails, thanks, I’ll stick to whisky. So sorry to keep you waiting
like this, but I was having a yarn with poor old Grainger upstairs. He’s

frail state. Ah, well! it’s what we must all come to. Dear me, there’s
your grandfather, Fentiman. He’s another of Penberthy’s miracles. He
must be ninety, if he’s a day. Will you excuse me for a moment? I must
just go and speak to him.’

==> Wimsey’s eyes followed the alert, elderly figure as it crossed the <==
spacious smoking-room, pausing now and again to exchange greetings with
a fellow-member of the Bellona Club. Drawn close to the huge fireplace
stood a great chair with ears after the Victorian pattern. A pair of
spindle shanks with neatly-buttoned shoes propped on a footstool was all
that was visible of General Fentiman.

‘Queer, isn’t it,’ muttered his grandson, ‘to think that for Old
Mossy-face the Crimea is still _the_ War, and the Boer business found
him too old to go out. He was given his commission at seventeen, you
know—was wounded at Majuba—’

==> He broke off. Wimsey was not paying attention. He was still watching <==
Colonel Marchbanks.

The Colonel came back to them, walking very quietly and precisely.
Wimsey rose and went to meet him.


[line number in individual story] matching line = 134    window = 129 139

He broke off. Wimsey was not paying attention. He was still watching
Colonel Marchbanks.

The Colonel came back to them, walking very quietly and precisely.

‘I say, Peter,’ said the Colonel, his kind face gravely troubled, ‘just
come over here a moment. I’m afraid something rather unpleasant has
happened.’

happened.’

Fentiman looked round, and something in their manner made him get up and
follow them over to the fire.

==> Wimsey bent down over General Fentiman and drew the _Morning Post_ <==
gently away from the gnarled old hands, which lay clasped over the thin
chest. He touched the shoulder—put his hand under the white head
huddled against the side of the chair. The Colonel watched him
anxiously. Then, with a quick jerk, Wimsey lifted the quiet figure. It
came up all of a piece, stiff as a wooden doll.

Fentiman laughed. Peal after hysterical peal shook his throat. All round
the room, scandalised Bellonians creaked to their gouty feet, shocked by
the unmannerly noise.

Dr Penberthy was just changing for dinner. He came down hurriedly,
caught just as he was going out to an Armistice dinner, his silk hat
tilted to the back of his head, his coat and muffler pushed loosely
open. He was a thin, dark man with the abrupt manner which distinguishes
the Army Surgeon from the West End practitioner. The group by the fire
==> made way for him, except Wimsey, who hung rather foolishly upon the big <==
elbow-chair, gazing in a helpless way at the body.

Penberthy ran practised hands quickly over neck, wrists and knee-joints.

‘Dead several hours,’ he pronounced sharply. ‘_Rigor_ well

‘All right. Ah! is the room ready, Culyer? Then we’ll move him. Will
somebody take his shoulders—no, not you, Culyer’ (for the Secretary had
only one sound arm), ‘Lord Peter, yes, thank you—lift carefully.’

==> Wimsey put his long, strong hands under the stiff arms; the doctor <==
gathered up the legs; they moved away. They looked like a dreadful
little Guy Fawkes procession, with that humped and unreverend manikin
bobbing and swaying between them.

The door closed after them, and a tension seemed removed. The circle

fellow-members. He retired, murmuring, to his chair and the evening
paper, and the Colonel stepped into the telephone-cabinet to call up
Lady Dormer’s house in Portman Square.

Presently he came out through the library into the entrance-hall, and
==> met Penberthy and Wimsey just descending the staircase. <==

‘Have you broken the news to Lady Dormer?’ asked Wimsey.

‘Lady Dormer is dead,’ said the Colonel. ‘Her maid tells me she passed
quietly away at half-past ten this morning.’

==> About ten days after that notable Armistice Day, Lord Peter Wimsey was <==
sitting in his library, reading a rare fourteenth-century manuscript of
Justinian. It gave him particular pleasure, being embellished with a
large number of drawings in sepia, extremely delicate in workmanship,
and not always equally so in subject. Beside him on a convenient table
stood a long-necked decanter of priceless old port. From time to time he

‘A certain amount, sir. But merely of a pictorial description, if I may
venture to call it so. Criminological material, sir, has been
distressingly deficient of late.’

==> ‘Perhaps Mr Murbles has brought us something,’ suggested Wimsey. <==

‘No,’ said Mr Murbles, holding the Cockburn ‘86 beneath his nostrils and
gently agitating the glass to release the ethers, ‘no, I can’t say I
have, precisely. I will not disguise that I have come in the hope of
deriving benefit from your trained habits of observation and deduction,

by a long chalk.’

‘By how long a chalk?’ asked Mr Murbles eagerly. ‘That is just what I am
trying to find out.’

==> ‘That’s very inquisitive of you,’ said Wimsey. ‘I think perhaps it would <==
be better’—he lifted his glass and tilted it thoughtfully, watching the
wine coil down in thin flower petallings from rim to stem—‘if you were
to tell me exactly what you want to know . . . and why. After all . . .
I’m a member of the Club . . . family associations chiefly, I suppose

==> Mr Murbles looked up sharply, but Wimsey’s attention seemed focused upon <==
the port.

‘Quite so,’ said the solicitor. ‘Very well. The facts of the matter are
these. General Fentiman had, as you know, a sister Felicity, twelve
years younger than himself. She was very beautiful and very wilful as a

family way—the old people put the best face they could on it in the
grand Victorian manner. That is, they gave their consent to the
marriage, forwarded their daughter’s belongings to her new home in
Manchester, and forbade her to darken their doors again.’

==> ‘Highly proper,’ murmured Wimsey. ‘I’m determined never to be a parent. <==
Modern manners and the break-up of the fine old traditions have simply
ruined the business. I shall devote my life and fortune to the endowment
of research on the best method of producin’ human beings decorously and
unobtrusively from eggs. All parental responsibility to devolve upon the
incubator.’

she should perform her maternal functions), leaving a numerous but
feeble family of children. Of these, the only one to attain maturity was
the father of the two Fentimans you know—Major Robert and Captain
George Fentiman.’

==> ‘I don’t know Robert very well,’ interjected Wimsey. ‘I’ve met him. <==
Frightfully hearty and all that—regular army type.’

‘Yes, he’s of the old Fentiman stock. Poor George inherited a weakly
strain from his grandmother, I’m afraid.’

Frightfully hearty and all that—regular army type.’

‘Yes, he’s of the old Fentiman stock. Poor George inherited a weakly
strain from his grandmother, I’m afraid.’

==> ‘Well, nervous, anyhow,’ said Wimsey, who knew better than the old <==
solicitor the kind of mental and physical strain George Fentiman had
undergone. The War pressed hardly upon imaginative men in responsible
positions. ‘And then he was gassed and all that, you know,’ he added
apologetically.

Honours List, he became Sir Henry Dormer, Bart. His only child—a
girl—had died, and there was no prospect of any further family, so
there was, of course, no reason why he should not be made a baronet for
his trouble.’

anything of that kind. Do lawyers ever go to heaven?’

‘I have no information on that point,’ said Mr Murbles dryly. ‘Lady
Dormer—’

anything of that kind. Do lawyers ever go to heaven?’

‘I have no information on that point,’ said Mr Murbles dryly. ‘Lady
Dormer—’

==> ‘Did the marriage turn out well otherwise?’ inquired Wimsey. <==

‘I believe it was perfectly happy,’ replied the lawyer; ‘an unfortunate
circumstance in one way, since it entirely precluded the possibility of
any reconciliation with her relatives. Lady Dormer, who was a fine,
generous-hearted woman, frequently made overtures of peace, but the

occasional visits and so forth, and so did George at one time. Of
course, they never let the General know a word about it, or he would
have had a fit. After the War, George rather dropped his great-aunt—I
don’t know why.’

==> ‘I can guess,’ said Wimsey. ‘No job—no money, y’know. Didn’t want to <==
look pointed. That sort of thing, what?’

‘Possibly. Or there may have been some kind of quarrel. I don’t know.
Anyway, those are the facts. I hope I am not boring you, by the way?’

‘Possibly. Or there may have been some kind of quarrel. I don’t know.
Anyway, those are the facts. I hope I am not boring you, by the way?’

==> ‘I am bearing up,’ said Wimsey, ‘waiting for the point where the money <==
comes in. There’s a steely legal glitter in your eye, sir, which
suggests that the thrill is not far off.’

‘Quite correct,’ said Mr Murbles. ‘I now come—thank you, well, yes—I
will take just one more glass. I thank Providence I am not of a gouty

‘Quite correct,’ said Mr Murbles. ‘I now come—thank you, well, yes—I
will take just one more glass. I thank Providence I am not of a gouty
constitution. Yes, Ah!—We now come to the melancholy event of November
11th last, and I must ask you to follow me with the closest attention.’

==> ‘By all means,’ said Wimsey politely. <==

‘Lady Dormer,’ pursued Mr Murbles, leaning earnestly forward, and
punctuating every sentence with sharp little jabs of his gold-mounted
eye-glasses, held in his right finger and thumb, ‘was an old woman, and
had been ailing for a very long time. However, she was still the same

‘Now then, at last—and you have been very patient with my tedious way
of explaining all this—we come to the point at which we want your
help.’

Mr Murbles refreshed himself with a sip of port, and, looking a little
==> anxiously at Wimsey, who had closed his eyes and appeared to be nearly <==
asleep, he resumed.

‘I have not mentioned, I think, how I come to be involved in this matter
myself. My father was the Fentimans’ family solicitor, a position to
which I naturally succeeded when I took over the business at his death.

‘Clear as a bell. Was Robert satisfied with that arrangement?’

‘Oh, dear, yes; perfectly. He knew all about the will beforehand and had
agreed that it was quite fair and right.’

==> ‘Nevertheless,’ said Wimsey, ‘it appears to be such a small matter on <==
the face of it, that you must be concealing something perfectly
devastating up your sleeve. Out with it, man, out with it! Whatever the
shock may be, I am braced to bear it.’

‘The shock,’ said Mr Murbles, ‘was inflicted on me, personally, last

hand, he should predecease her, the conditions were reversed. In that
case the bulk of the money came to Miss Dorland, and fifteen thousand
pounds were to be equally divided between Major Robert Fentiman and his
brother George.’

==> Wimsey whistled softly. <==

‘I quite agree with you,’ said Mr Murbles. ‘It is a most awkward
situation. Lady Dormer died at precisely 10.37 a.m. on November 11th.
General Fentiman died that same morning at some time, presumably after
10 o’clock, which was his usual hour for arriving at the Club, and

twelve thousand pounds, George Fentiman is left with the small pittance
bequeathed to him under his father’s will—while Robert Fentiman, the
residuary legatee, inherits a very considerable fortune of well over
half a million.’

==> ‘And what,’ said Wimsey, ‘do you want me to do about it?’ <==

‘Why,’ replied the lawyer, with a slight cough, ‘it occurred to me that
you, with your—if I may say so—remarkable powers of deduction and
analysis, might be able to solve the extremely difficult and delicate
problem of the precise moment of General Fentiman’s decease. You were in

personal character, exceptionally well fitted to carry out the necessary
investigations without creating any—ahem!—public agitation
or—er—scandal, or, in fact notoriety, which would, I need hardly say,
be extremely painful to all concerned.’

==> ‘It’s awkward,’ said Wimsey, ‘uncommonly awkward.’ <==

‘It is indeed,’ said the lawyer with some warmth, ‘for, as we are now
situated, it is impossible to execute either will or—or, in short, do
anything at all. It is most unfortunate that the circumstances were not
fully understood at the time, when the—um—the body of General Fentiman

will, I had no idea that anything beyond Dr Penberthy’s certificate was,
or ever could become, necessary.’

‘Couldn’t you get the parties to come to some agreement?’ suggested
==> Wimsey. <==

‘If we are unable to reach any satisfactory conclusion about the time of
the death, that will probably be the only way out of the difficulty. But
at the moment there are certain obstacles—’

suppose? No. H’m, well! From a purely detached point of view it’s a very
pleasin’ and pretty little problem, you know.’

‘You will undertake to solve it for us, then, Lord Peter?’

==> Wimsey’s fingers tapped out an intricate fugal passage on the arm of his <==
chair.

‘If I were you, Murbles, I’d try again to get a settlement.’

‘Do you mean,’ asked Mr Murbles, ‘that you think my clients have a

‘None to speak of. I would rather you undertook the whole investigation
from the beginning.’

‘Very well. I’ll start tomorrow and let you know how it gets on.’

==> The lawyer thanked him and took his departure. Wimsey sat pondering for <==
a short time, then rang the bell for his manservant.

‘A new notebook, please, Bunter. Head it “Fentiman”, and be ready to
come round with me to the Bellona Club tomorrow, complete with camera
and the rest of the outfit.’

example by the bloodhound, who will follow up with equal and impartial
zest the trail of a parricide or of a bottle of aniseed.

‘I will bear it in mind, my lord.’

==> Wimsey moved slowly across to the little black baby grand that stood in <==
the corner of the library.

‘Not Bach this evening,’ he murmured to himself. ‘Bach for tomorrow,
when the grey matter begins to revolve.’ A melody of Parry’s formed
itself crooningly under his fingers. ‘For man walketh in a vain shadow

‘You are quite sure this suit is all right, Bunter?’ said Lord Peter
anxiously.

It was an easy lounge suit, tweedy in texture, and a trifle more
==> pronounced in colour and pattern than Wimsey usually permitted himself. <==
While not unsuitable for town wear, it yet diffused a faint suggestion
of hills and the sea.

‘I want to look approachable,’ he went on, ‘but on no account loud. I
can’t help wondering whether that stripe of invisible green wouldn’t

‘Thanks. Well, I think that’s all. I’ll go on now, and I want you to
follow on with the doings in about an hour’s time.’

The Bellona Club is situated in Piccadilly, not many hundred yards west
==> of Wimsey’s own flat, which overlooks the Green Park. The commissionaire <==
greeted him with a pleased smile.

‘Mornin’, Rogers. How are you?’

‘Very well, my lord. I thank you.’

And then, “Fine morning,” he’d say, as like as not. And sometimes ask
after Mrs Rogers and the family. A fine old gentleman, my lord. We shall
all miss him.’

‘Did you notice whether he seemed specially feeble or tired that morning
==> at all?’ inquired Wimsey casually, tapping a cigarette on the back of <==
his hand.

‘Why, no, my lord. I beg your pardon; I fancied you knew. I wasn’t on
duty that day, my lord. I was kindly given permission to attend the
ceremony at the Cenotaph. Very grand sight it was, too, my lord. Mrs

already engaged with two or three inquiries, plunged abruptly into the
cloak-room, where the attendant, a bright Cockney with a Sam Weller face
and an artificial leg, was ready enough to talk about General Fentiman.

‘Well, now, my lord, that’s funny you should ask me that,’ he said, when
==> Wimsey had dexterously worked in an inquiry as to the time of the <==
General’s arrival at Bellona. ‘Dr Penberthy was askin’ the same
question. It’s a fair puzzle that is. I could count on the fingers of
one ’and the mornings I’ve missed seein’ the General come in. Wonderful
regular, the General was, and him being such a very old gentleman, I’d
make a point of being ’andy, to ’elp him off with his overcoat and such.

‘Oh, yes, my lord. ’Alf-past twelve I goes off, and his hat and coat
were on the peg then, because I seen ’em.’

come to, after all? They’re all sayin’ as it’s an unpleasant thing for
the Club, but _I_ say, where’s the odds? There ain’t many ’ouses what
somebody ain’t died in, some time or another. We don’t think any the
worse of the ’ouses, so why think the worse of the Club?’

==> ‘You’re a philosopher, Williamson.’ Wimsey climbed the short flight of <==
marble steps and turned into the bar. ‘It’s narrowin’ down,’ he muttered
to himself. ‘Between ten-fifteen and twelve-thirty. Looks as if it was
goin’ to be a close run for the Dormer stakes. But—dash it all! Let’s
hear what Penberthy has to say.’

The doctor was already standing at the bar with a whisky-and-soda before

more ado.

‘Look here,’ he said, ‘I just wanted a word with you about old Fentiman.
Frightfully confidential, and all that. But it seems the exact time of
the poor old blighter’s departure has become an important item. Question

‘Nothing about the body struck you as queer?’

‘What sort of thing?’

==> ‘You know what I mean as well as I do,’ said Wimsey, suddenly turning <==
and looking the other straight in the face. The change in him was almost
startling—it was as if a steel blade had whipped suddenly out of its
velvet scabbard. Penberthy met his eye, and nodded slowly.

‘Yes, I do know what you mean. But not here. We’d better go up to the

Strategy and Tactics, or to hunt up an ancient Army List, but for the
most part it was deserted. Sitting in the farthest bay, immured by books
and silence, confidential conversation could be carried on with all the
privacy of the confessional.

==> ‘Well, now,’ said Wimsey, ‘what about it?’ <==

‘About—?’ prompted the doctor, with professional caution.

‘About that leg?’

‘No—I wanted to think it over. You see, it suggested, at the first
blush, something rather—’

the last two days! Well, let’s face it. Let’s admit, straight away that,
once _rigor_ sets in, it stays in till it starts to pass off, and that,
when it _does_ start to go, it usually begins with the face and jaw, and
not suddenly in one knee-joint. Now Fentiman’s jaw and neck were as
rigid as wood—I felt ’em. But the left leg swung loose from the knee.

‘It might seem alarming to a man in a very nervous state. We have one or
two shell-shock cases here that I wouldn’t answer for in an emergency.
It would be worth considering, perhaps, if anyone had shown special
signs of agitation or shock that day.’

==> ‘That’s an idea,’ said Wimsey slowly. ‘Suppose—suppose, for instance, <==
there was somebody connected in some way with the General who was in an
unnerved state of mind—and suppose he came suddenly on this stiff
corpse. You think he might—possibly—lose his head?’

‘It’s certainly possible. I can imagine that he might behave

annoyin’ly few of them in this case. Won’t you have another whisky?’

‘No, thanks. Due at my surgery. See you another time. Cheerio!’

==> Wimsey remained for a few moments after he had gone, smoking <==
meditatively. Then he turned his chair to the table, took a sheet of
paper from the rack and began to jot down a few notes of the case with
his fountain pen. He had not got far, however, before one of the Club
servants entered, peering into all the bays in turn, looking for
somebody.

‘Want me, Fred?’

‘Your lordship’s man is here, my lord, and says you may wish to be

his notes. Then his face changed. The corner of a sheet of paper
protruded slightly. On the principle that nothing is too small to be
looked at, Wimsey poked an inquisitive finger between the leaves, and
extracted the paper. It bore a few scrawls relating to sums of money,
very carelessly and shakily written. Wimsey looked at it attentively for

asked him questions—together with distant allusions to the telephones

asked if he’d dined. Fact is, there’s a bit of a muddle about the exact

‘Well, you can’t expect an outsider to grasp a thing like that. Wait a
minute. Culyer, you seem to have a fairly juicy pipe there. Give us a
cleaner.’

==> Wimsey thrust the instrument energetically through the stem of the pipe, <==
bringing out a revolting collection of brown, oily matter.

‘Nicotine poisoning, Culyer—that’s what you’ll die of if you aren’t
jolly careful. Here you are, Bunter. Judiciously smeared upon the
fingertips, that should give quite the right effect. Now, look here, Mr

‘Thanks frightfully, Culyer. I’ll make myself scarce now. Carry on,
Bunter.’

exchanged a mute greeting with one or two of the assembled veterans,
picked up the _Morning Post_, and looked round for a seat. The great
armchair with ears still stood before the fire, but some dim feeling of

the members, having only just taken over his new duties. He thought it
odd that he should not have noticed so very venerable a gentleman, but
==> the fact remained that he had not. He regretted it extremely. Wimsey <==
gathered that Weston was annoyed at having lost a chance of reflected
celebrity. He had missed his scoop, as the reporters say.

Nor was the hall-porter any more helpful. The morning of November 11th
had been a busy one. He had been in and out of his little glass

Nor was the hall-porter any more helpful. The morning of November 11th
had been a busy one. He had been in and out of his little glass
pigeon-hole continually, shepherding guests into various rooms to find
the members they wanted, distributing letters and chatting to country
members who visited the Bellona seldom and liked to ‘have a chat with
==> Piper’ when they did. He could not recollect seeing the General. Wimsey <==
began to feel that there must have been a conspiracy to overlook the old
gentleman on the last morning of his life.

‘You don’t think he never was here at all, do you, Bunter?’ he
suggested. ‘Walkin’ about invisible and tryin’ hard to communicate, like

Bunter was inclined to reject the psychic view of the case.

‘The General must have been here in the body, my lord, because there
_was_ the body.’

==> ‘That’s true,’ said Wimsey. ‘I’m afraid we can’t explain away the body. <==
S’pose that means I’ll have to question every member of this beastly
Club separately. But just at the moment I think we’d better go round to
the General’s flat and hunt up Robert Fentiman. Weston, get me a taxi,
please.’

The door of the little flat in Dover Street was opened by an elderly
manservant, whose anxious face bore signs of his grief at his master’s
death. He informed them that Major Fentiman was at home and would be
==> happy to receive Lord Peter Wimsey. As he spoke, a tall, soldierly man <==
of about forty-five came out from one of the rooms and hailed his
visitor cheerily.

‘That you, Wimsey? Murbles told me to expect you. Come in. Haven’t seen

all this fuss about the will. However, I’m his executor, so all this
part of it falls to me in any case. It’s very decent of you to lend us a
hand. Queer old girl, Great Aunt Dormer. Meant well, you know, but made
it damned awkward for everybody. How are you getting along?’

==> Wimsey explained the failure of his researches at the Bellona. <==

‘Thought I’d better get a line on it at this end,’ he added. ‘If we know
exactly what time he left here in the morning, we ought to be able to
get an idea of the time he got to the Club.’

Was the General all right that morning? Usual health and spirits, and
all that?’

‘Entirely so, my lord. General Fentiman was accustomed to rise early, my

‘Yes, sir. General Fentiman was good enough to say, sir, he did not wish
me to have the heavy responsibility of looking after him alone in case
of illness. He was a very kind, thoughtful gentleman.’ The man’s voice
faltered.

==> ‘Just so,’ said Wimsey. ‘I’m sure you must be very sorry to lose him, <==
Woodward. Still, one couldn’t expect otherwise, you know. I’m sure you
looked after him splendidly. What was it happened about three o’clock?’

‘Why, my lord, they rang up from Lady Dormer’s to say as how her
ladyship was very ill, and would General Fentiman please come at once if

taxi, and he says, ‘You needn’t come with me, Woodward. I don’t quite
know how long I shall stay there. They will see that I get home quite
safely.’ So I told the man where to take him and came back to the flat.
And that, my lord, was the last time I see him.’

==> Wimsey made a sympathetic clucking sound. <==

‘Yes, my lord. When General Fentiman didn’t return at his usual time, I
thought he was maybe staying to dine at Lady Dormer’s, and took no
notice of it. However, at half-past eight I began to be afraid of the
night air for him; it was very cold that day, my lord, if you remember.

rang off. And that was all I knew till I heard next day of the General
being dead, my lord.’

‘There now,’ said Robert Fentiman. ‘What do you think of that?’

==> ‘Odd,’ said Wimsey, ‘and most unfortunate as it turns out. Did the <==
General often stay out at night, Woodward?’

‘Never, my lord. I don’t recollect such a thing happening once in five
or six years. In the old days, perhaps, he’d visit friends occasionally,
but not of late.’

He may be older—must be, if he’s an old friend of grandfather’s. I

suburb, but I’m hanged if I can remember which.’

there’s quite a lot to be said for women.’

‘What’s that got to do with it?’

‘So she would,’ said Fentiman, with a grin. ‘That’s why I’ve never
married.’

information you’re simply a washout. Do, for goodness’ sake, pull
yourself together and try to remember something a bit more definite
about the fellow. It may mean half a million to you to know what time

‘I suppose it is. I’ll do my best to remember. But I’m not sure that I
ever knew.’

us, but it’s not a police case. And I don’t suppose you particularly
want to advertise.’

‘Well—it may come to that. But, naturally, we’re not keen on publicity
if we can avoid it. If only I could remember exactly what work he said

‘Right.’

were conversing in the next room. A glance told Wimsey that this was the
General’s bedroom.

On a table beside the narrow iron bedstead was an old-fashioned
writing-desk. Wimsey took it up, weighed it in his hands a moment and

Robert Fentiman greeted his feeble pleasantry with an indulgent grin,
and produced the telephone directory, to which Bunter immediately
applied himself. Finding two and a half columns of Olivers, he removed
the receiver and started to work steadily through them in rotation.

neatly made, the wash-hand apparatus set in order, as though the
occupant might return at any moment, every speck of dust removed—a
tribute to Woodward’s reverent affection, but a depressing sight for an
investigator. Wimsey sat down and let his eye rove slowly from the
hanging wardrobe, with its polished doors, over the orderly line of

furniture.

‘Did he brush his own teeth, or dental plate, or whatever it was?’

‘Oh, yes, my lord. General Fentiman had an excellent set of teeth for
his age.’

toothbrush over to the window. The result of the scrutiny was
unsatisfactory. He looked around again.

‘Is that his walking-stick?’

Will you be very careful to see that it is not touched by anybody
beforehand?’

‘Certainly, my lord.’

==> Wimsey stood the stick carefully in its corner again, and then, as <==
though it had put a new train of ideas into his mind, walked across to
the shoe-shelf.

‘Which were the shoes General Fentiman was wearing at the time of his
death?’

me, my lord.’

‘That’s very fortunate.’

==> Wimsey turned them over and examined the soles very carefully, both with <==
the lens and with the naked eye. With a small pair of tweezers, taken
from his pocket, he delicately removed a small fragment of
pile—apparently from a thick carpet—which was clinging to a projecting
brad, and stored it carefully away in an envelope. Then, putting the
right shoe aside, he subjected the left to a prolonged scrutiny,

been a piece of priceless Waterford glass.

‘I should like to see all the clothes General Fentiman was wearing that
day—the outer garments, I mean—hat, suit, overcoat, and so on.’

==> The garments were produced, and Wimsey went over every inch of them with <==
the same care and patience, watched by Woodward with flattering
attention.

‘Have they been brushed?’

‘No, my lord—only shaken out.’ This time Woodward offered no apology,
having grasped dimly that polishing and brushing were not acts which
called for approval under these unusual circumstances.

small ruffling of the threads on the left-hand trouser leg, ‘we might be
able to get some sort of a clue from the dust on the clothes, if any—to
show us where the General spent the night. If—to take a rather unlikely

suppose that he had been visiting a carpenter. Or a dead leaf might

Bunter set up the camera and focused it.

‘Unless,’ observed Major Fentiman, ‘they are Mr Oliver’s. That would be
a good joke, wouldn’t it?’

insertions, to run for three days unless cancelled, ‘Oliver had a car
and ran the old boy up himself. Still, it’s just worth trying.’

He had a parcel under his arm, and his next proceeding was to hail a cab
and drive to the residence of Sir James Lubbock, the well-known analyst.

in superintending a Marsh’s test for arsenic.

‘D’ye mind just taking a pew for a moment, while I finish this off?’

burner playing steadily upon the glass tube, and the dark brown deposit
slowly forming and deepening at the narrow end. From time to time the
analyst poured down the thistle-funnel a small quantity of a highly
disagreeable-looking liquid from a stoppered phial; once his assistant

people are with their drugs. You can’t teach ’em. An office-boy who was
as incompetent as the average murderer would be sacked with a kick in

General Fentiman’s left boot; ‘it’s cheek to come to you about it. But I
want very much to know what this is, and as it’s strictly a private

and a dozen or so antiquated anatomical treatises. Presently Saunders
returned with his report. The deposit was nothing more nor less than an
ordinary brown paint and varnish of a kind well known to joiners and
furniture makers. It was a modern preparation, with nothing unusual
about it; one might find it anywhere. It was not a floor-varnish—one

analysed it and that this is the varnish he analysed. All according to
Cocker. Here you are. Sign here and here, and that will be

and sixty.’

Sir James Lubbock looked properly thrilled.

General Fentiman died before his sister, you get seven thousand; if he

go to Murbles and get him to advance you the money on your expectations.
You can’t get away with less than two thousand, whatever happens, so

must have been rather talkative. I suppose he told Pritchard he was

The servant still stood mutely by, with an air of almost violently
disassociating himself from all commentary.

faithful—and I’m sure your brother’s all that—as for their opening
doors and saying “thank you”. I’ve noticed it lots of times.’

‘A man ought to be just as courteous after marriage as he was before,’
declared Robert Fentiman virtuously.

‘So he ought, but he never is. Possibly there’s some reason we don’t

inquisitiveness—and they generally just grunt and say that _their_
wives are sensible and take their affection for granted. But I don’t
believe women ever get sensible, not even through prolonged association
with their husbands.’

amblin’ off. Many thanks, and let me know if you get hold of Oliver.’

‘Oh, rather!’

==> Wimsey considered a few moments on the doorstep, and then drove straight <==
down to New Scotland Yard, where he was soon ushered into
Detective-Inspector Parker’s office.

Parker, a square-built man in the late thirties, with the nondescript
features which lend themselves so excellently to detective purposes, was

Parker, a square-built man in the late thirties, with the nondescript
features which lend themselves so excellently to detective purposes, was
possibly Lord Peter’s most intimate—in some ways his only
intimate—friend. The two men had worked out many cases together and
each respected the other’s qualities, though no two characters could

combination—quick, impulsive, careless, and an artistic
jack-of-all-trades. Parker was the Oliver—cautious, solid, painstaking,
his mind a blank to art and literature, and exercising itself, in spare
moments, with Evangelical theology. He was the one person who was never
irritated by Wimsey’s mannerisms, and Wimsey repaid him with a genuine

‘Well, how goes it?’

‘Not so bad. I want you to do something for me.’

As a matter of fact, I’m rather expecting to hear something about it

these two handwritings are the same.’

The expert took up the paper and the cheques, and looked them over
attentively.

‘That’s fine. That checks up the results of the fingerprint test too. I
don’t mind telling you, Charles,’ he added, when Collins had departed,
‘that this case is getting damned interesting.’

At this point the telephone rang, and Parker, after listening for some
==> time, ejaculated, ‘Good work!’ and then, turning to Wimsey: <==

‘That’s our man. They’ve got him. Excuse me if I rush off. Between you
and me, we’ve pulled this off rather well. It may mean rather a big
thing for me. Sure we can’t do anything else for you? Because I’ve got
to get to Sheffield. See you tomorrow or next day.’

==> He caught up his coat and hat and was gone. Wimsey made his own way out <==
and sat for a long time at home, with Bunter’s photographs of the
Bellona Club before him, thinking.

At six o’clock, he presented himself at Mr Murbles’s chambers in Staple
Inn. The two taxi-drivers had already arrived and were seated, well on

solicitor.

‘Ah!’ said Mr Murbles, ‘this is a gentleman who is interested in the
inquiry we are making. Perhaps you would have the goodness to repeat to
him what you have already told me. I have ascertained enough,’ he added,
==> turning to Wimsey, ‘to feel sure that these are the right drivers, but I <==
should like you to put any questions you wish yourself. This gentleman’s
name is Swain, and his story should come first, I think.’

‘Well, sir,’ said Mr Swain, a stout man of the old type of driver, ‘you
was wanting to know if anybody picked up an old gent in Portman Square

speakin’, if you understand me, sir. So the footman tells me to drive
’im to a number in ’Arley Street.’

‘Do you remember it?’

==> Swain mentioned a number which Wimsey recognised as Penberthy’s. <==

‘So I drives ’im there. And ’e asks me to ring the bell for ’im, and
when the young man comes to the door to ask if the doctor could please
see General Fenton, or Fennimore, or some such name, sir.’

sir, ’e won’t be ’ere long, I thinks. So we ’elps him up the steps into
the ’ouse and ’e gives me my fare and a shilling for myself, and that’s
the last I see of ’im, sir.’

==> ‘That fits in all right with what Penberthy said,’ agreed Wimsey. ‘The <==
General felt the strain of his interview with his sister and went
straight round to see him. Right. Now, how about this other part of the
business?’

‘Well,’ said Mr Murbles, ‘I think this gentleman, whose name is—let me

‘Yes, sir. Well, he gets in, and he says, ‘Take me to Dover Street,’ he
says, but if you was to ask me the number, sir, I’m afraid I don’t
rightly remember, because, you see we never went there after all.’

==> ‘Never went there?’ cried Wimsey. <==

‘No, sir. Just as we was comin’ out into Cavendish Square, the old
gentleman puts his head out and says, ‘Stop!’ So I stops, and I see him
wavin’ his hand to a gentleman on the pavement. So this other one comes
up, and they has a few words together and then the old—’

down there, and the old gentleman says, “Good-bye, George, bear in mind
what I have said.” So the gentleman says, “I will, sir,” and I see him
cross the road, like as if he might be going up Park Street.’

==> Mr Murbles and Wimsey exchanged glances. <==

‘And then where did you go?’

‘Then, sir, the fare says to me, “Do you know the Bellona Club in
Picadilly?” he says. So I says, “Yes, sir.”’

‘It might be getting on for half-past six, sir. I’d been driving very
slow, as I tells you, sir. So I takes him to the Club, like he said, and
in he goes, and that’s the last I see of him, sir.’

==> ‘Thanks very much,’ said Wimsey. ‘Did he seem to be at all upset or <==
agitated when he was talking to the man he called George?’

‘No, sir, I couldn’t say that. But I thought he spoke a bit sharp-like.
What you might call telling him off, sir.’

suitable acknowledgement and departed, leaving their addresses behind
them.

‘So he went back to the Bellona Club. I wonder what for?’

==> ‘I think I know,’ said Wimsey. ‘He was accustomed to do any writing or <==
business there, and I fancy he went back to put down some notes as to
what he meant to do with the money his sister was leaving him. Look at
this sheet of paper, sir. That’s the General’s handwriting, as I’ve
proved this afternoon, and those are his fingerprints. And the initials

‘That,’ said Mr Murbles, with a look of horror, ‘would be _most_
undesirable.’

Fentiman was saying to Captain George.’

‘When did you last see George Fentiman?’

practically gone.’

He went. He never stopped going till he came to Finsbury Park. George
was out, and so, of course, was Mrs Fentiman, but the charwoman said she
had heard the Captain mention he was going down to Great Portland
==> Street. Wimsey went in pursuit. A couple of hours spent lounging round <==
showrooms and talking to car-demonstrators, nearly all of whom were, in
one manner or another, his dear old pals, resulted in the discovery that
George Fentiman was being taken on by the Walmisley-Hubbard outfit for a
few weeks to show what he could do.

Oh, lord, yes! _He’s_ all right.’

‘He looks a bit nervy,’ said the particular dear old pal attached to the
Walmisley-Hubbard show. ‘Wants bucking up, what? That reminds me. What

At Gatti’s he left George in a corner while he went to have a chat with

which aroused even George’s curiosity, full as he was of his own

‘It’s all so damned unfair,’ said George. ‘Do you know,’ he burst out,
the sense of grievance suddenly overpowering his wounded vanity, ‘the

but of course I didn’t mean half I said. She knows that, but the old man
took it all seriously.’

==> ‘Half a moment,’ broke in Wimsey. ‘Did he say all this to you in the <==
taxi that day?’

‘Yes, he did. A long lecture, all about the purity and courage of a good
woman, driving round and round Regent’s Park. I had to promise to turn
over a new leaf and all that. Like being back at one’s prep school.’

swollen great rats for a penny a time, and laughing at them. Rats. Alive
and putrid with what they’d been feeding on. Oh, yes. Robert was thought
a damn’ good soldier.’

==> ‘Very fortunate for him,’ said Wimsey. <==

‘Yes. He’s the same sort as grandfather. They liked each other. Still,

Lunch ended on a more cheerful note than it had begun. As they came out

‘Haven’t you, by Jove? Well, _I’ve_ seen _you_ hanging about, and if you
do it any more I’ll give you something to remember me by. D’you hear?’

‘what’s up—Here, you, wait a moment!’

But at sight of Wimsey the man had slipped like an eel among the roaring
Strand traffic, and was lost to view.

“Did you see that? The lousy little beggar! Made off like a shot when I
threatened him. That’s the fellow who’s been dogging me about for three
days.’

my awful aspect that drove him away. What is it about me? Have I a front
like Jove to threaten and command? Or am I wearing a repulsive tie?’

‘He’s gone, anyway.’

‘Yes—well, while you’re on duty the detective must keep watch.’

Cross. And after that I’m going down to Chelsea, and I don’t quite know
when I shall be back. You’d better take the afternoon off. Put me out
some sandwiches or something, and don’t wait up if I’m late.’

==> Wimsey disposed quickly of his business with Sleuths Incorporated, and <==
then made his way to a pleasant little studio overlooking the river at
Chelsea. The door, which bore a neat label, ‘Miss Marjorie Phelps’, was
opened by a pleasant-looking young woman with curly hair and a blue
overall heavily smudged with clay.

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 31313    window = 31308 31318



Miss Phelps cocked her head on one side and looked critically at the
little dancing lady she was modelling. She had made a line of her own in
pottery figurines, which sold well and were worth the money.

==> ‘That’s rather attractive,’ said Wimsey. <==

‘Rather pretty-pretty. But it’s a special order, and one can’t afford to
be particular. I’ve done a Christmas present for you, by the way. You’d
better have a look at it, and if you think it offensive we’ll smash it
together. It’s in that cupboard.’

==> Wimsey opened the cupboard and extracted a little figure about nine <==
inches high. It represented a young man in a flowing dressing-gown,
absorbed in the study of a huge volume held on his knee. The portrait
was life-like. He chuckled.

‘It’s damned good, Marjorie. A very fine bit of modelling. I’d love to

‘That’ll please her no end. Thanks ever so. I shall look forward to
Christmas for once. Shall I make some toast?’

‘Rather!’

==> Wimsey squatted happily down before the gas fire, while the modeller <==
went on with her work. Tea and figurine were ready almost at the same
moment, and Miss Phelps, flinging off her overall, threw herself
luxuriously into a battered armchair by the hearth.

‘And what can I do for you?’

her, and the wonderful thing is that she didn’t try to monopolise her.
She let her have a big place for a studio and bring in any friends she
liked and go about as she chose—in reason, of course.’

‘Lady Dormer suffered a good deal from oppressive relations in her own
==> youth,’ said Wimsey. <==

‘I know, but most old people seem to forget that. I’m sure Lady Dormer
had time enough. She must have been rather unusual. Mind you, I didn’t
know her very well, and I don’t really know a great deal about Ann
Dorland. I’ve been there, of course. She gave parties—rather

have the pleasure. And it doesn’t matter not being able to paint. Look
at Bobby Hobart and his ghastly daubs—he’s a perfect dear and everybody
loves him. I think Ann Dorland must have a complex of some kind.
Complexes explain so much, like the blessed word hippopotamus.’

==> Wimsey helped himself lavishly to honey and looked receptive. <==

‘I think really,’ went on Miss Phelps, ‘that Ann ought to have been
something in the City. She has brains, you know. She’d run anything
awfully well. But she isn’t creative. And then, of course, so many of
our little lot seem to be running love-affairs. And a continual

identity and good faith, and after persuading him to give a promise to
keep the peace. He had then reminded Fentiman that private persons were
not entitled to assault or arrest peaceable people against whom no
charge could be made, pointing out to him that his proper course, when
Oliver denied being Oliver, would have been to follow on quietly and
==> keep a watch on him, while communicating with Wimsey or Mr Murbles or <==
Sleuths Incorporated. He added that he was himself now waiting at
Southampton for further instructions from Lord Peter. Should he follow
to Venice, or send his subordinate, or should he return to London? In
view of the frank behaviour of Mr Postlethwaite, it seemed probable that
a genuine mistake had been made as to identity, but Fentiman insisted

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 31619    window = 31614 31624


that I ought to have followed him up quietly. But how was I to know that
he wouldn’t answer to his name?’

‘But you ought to have guessed, when he didn’t, that either you had made
a mistake or that he had some very good motive for trying to get away,’
==> said Wimsey. <==

‘I wasn’t accusing him of anything.’

‘Of course not, but he seems to have thought you were.’

trying to hop off like that, without giving us any help, and when I
thought about that half-million, it made me so mad I just collared him.
“Oh, no, you don’t,” I said—and that was how the fun began, don’t you
see.’

==> ‘I see perfectly,’ said Wimsey. ‘But don’t _you_ see, that if he really <==
_is_ Oliver and has gone off in that elaborate manner, with false
passports and everything, he must have something important to conceal?’

Fentiman’s jaw dropped.

‘There’s only Oliver—and I may have been mistaken about him.’

‘But I thought you were so sure?’

scandal it would make!’

‘Why should it? You are the executor. You can make a private application
and the whole thing can be done quite privately.’

‘Good Lord!—that would be a poor look-out for me.’

‘It might be the other way, you know.’

==> ‘I don’t like it, Wimsey. It’s very unpleasant. I wish to goodness we <==
could compromise on it’

‘But the lady in the case won’t compromise. You know that. We’ve got to
get at the facts somehow. I shall certainly get Murbles to suggest the
exhumation to Pritchard.’

if _you’re_ an honest man, you’ll give your consent. _You’ve_ nothing to
conceal, I suppose?’

‘Of course not. Still, it seems rather—’

==> ‘They suspect us already of some kind of dirty work,’ persisted Wimsey. <==
‘That brute Pritchard as good as told me so. I’m expecting every day to
hear that he has suggested exhumation off his own bat. I’d rather we got
in first with it.’

‘If that’s the case, I suppose we must do it. But I can’t believe it’ll

The disconcerted Major refused the drink rather shortly, and prepared to
depart.

==> ‘You mustn’t think I’m not grateful, Wimsey, and all that. But it is <==
rather unseemly.’

‘With all your experience,’ said Wimsey, ‘you oughtn’t to be so
sensitive about corpses. We’ve seen many things much unseemlier than a
nice, quiet little resurrection in a respectable cemetery.’

‘Oh, I don’t care twopence about the corpse,’ retorted the Major, ‘but
the thing doesn’t look well. That’s all.’

==> ‘Think of the money,’ grinned Wimsey, shutting the door of the flat upon <==
him.

He returned to the library, balancing the two letters in his hand.
‘There’s many a man now walking the streets of London,’ said he,
‘through not clearing trumps. Take these letters to the post, Bunter.

‘Very good, my lord.’

official whom he knew very well at the Home Office. This done, he
returned to the telephone and asked for Penberthy’s number.

‘That you, Penberthy? . . . Wimsey speaking . . . Look here, old man,

the Bellona affair with the cheerful appreciation of a connoisseur
sampling a vintage port. Mr Murbles, on the other hand, grew more and
more depressed as the story was unfolded.

Parker opened his mouth to reply, but Mr Murbles was beforehand with
him.

‘This Oliver appears to be a very elusive person,’ said he.

Harris. Would it altogether surprise you to learn that when I asked a
few discreet questions at Gatti’s, I discovered not only that nobody
there had the slightest recollection of Oliver, but that no inquiries
about him had ever been made by Major Fentiman?’

words. Do you suspect him of—er—?’

==> ‘Well,’ said Wimsey, ‘I knew _something_ odd had happened, you know, as <==
soon as I saw the General’s body—when I pulled the _Morning Post_ away
so easily from under his hands. If he had really died clutching it, the
_rigor_ would have made his clutch so tight that one would have had to
prise the fingers open to release it. And then, that knee-joint!’

‘No, no,’ said Mr Murbles, seized with an idea. ‘Repellent as the whole
notion is to me, I see no difficulty about that. Robert Fentiman was at
that time living in the Club. No doubt the General died in Robert’s
bedroom and was concealed there till the next morning!’

==> Wimsey shook his head. ‘That won’t work. I think the General’s hat and <==
coat and things were in Robert’s bedroom, but the corpse couldn’t have
been. Think, sir. Here is a photograph of the entrance-hall, with the
big staircase running up in full view of the front door and the desk and

‘Where, then?’

‘Yes, where? After all, Peter, we’ve got to make this story hold water.’

==> Wimsey spread the rest of the photographs out upon the table. <==

‘Look for yourselves,’ he said. ‘Here is the end bay of the library,
where the General was sitting making notes about the money he was to
inherit. A very nice, retired spot, invisible from the doorway, supplied
with ink, blotter, writing-paper and every modern convenience, including

‘Which, you will remember, was so annoyingly labelled “Out of Order”
when Wetheridge wanted to telephone. I can’t find anybody who remembers
putting up that notice, by the way.’

==> ‘Good God, Wimsey! Impossible. Think of the risk.’ <==

‘What risk? If anybody opened the door, there was old General Fentiman,
who had gone in, not seeing the notice, and died of fury at not being
able to get his call. Agitation acting on a weak heart and all that. Not
_very_ risky, really. Unless somebody was to think to inquire about the

‘Aren’t I? But we can prove it. We’re going down to the Bellona Club to
prove it now. Half-past eleven. A nice, quiet time. Shall I tell you

‘Bless my soul,’ said Mr Murbles. ‘Let us go at once. Really, this is
most exciting. That is, I am profoundly grieved. I hope it is not as you
say.’

They hastened downstairs and stood for a few moments waiting for a taxi

There was a scuffle, and out into the light came a small man, heavily
muffled in an overcoat, with his hat thrust down to his eyebrows in the
manner of a stage detective. Wimsey unbonneted him with the air of a
conjuror producing a rabbit from a hat.

conspirator when I called on him. The only thing that puzzles me now is
why he should have suddenly offered to compromise.’

‘Probably Miss Dorland lost patience, or they despaired of proving
anything,’ said Parker. ‘While Robert stuck to that Oliver story, it

‘Probably Miss Dorland lost patience, or they despaired of proving
anything,’ said Parker. ‘While Robert stuck to that Oliver story, it
would be very hard to prove anything.’

==> ‘Exactly,’ said Wimsey. ‘That is why I had to hang on so long, and press <==
Robert so hard about it. I might suspect Oliver to be non-existent, but
one can’t prove a negative.’

‘And suppose he still sticks to the story now?’


[line number in individual story] matching line = 4726    window = 4721 4731

Robert so hard about it. I might suspect Oliver to be non-existent, but
one can’t prove a negative.’

‘And suppose he still sticks to the story now?’

==> ‘Oh! I think we can put the wind up him all right,’ said Wimsey. ‘By the <==
time we’ve displayed our proofs and told him exactly what he was doing
with himself on November 10th and 11th, he’ll have no more spirit in him
than the Queen of Sheba.’

‘It must be done at once,’ said Mr Murbles. ‘And of course this

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 32325    window = 32320 32330



‘It must be done at once,’ said Mr Murbles. ‘And of course this
exhumation business will have to be stopped. I will go round and see
Robert Fentiman tomorrow—this morning, that is.’

==> ‘Better tell him to trot round to your place,’ said Wimsey. ‘I’ll bring <==
all the evidence round there, and I’ll have the varnish on the cabinet
analysed and shown to correspond with the sample I took from the
General’s boots. Make it for two o’clock, and then we can all go round
and interview Pritchard afterwards.’

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 32338    window = 32333 32343


It being, however, pointed out to him that Fentiman was in Richmond,
that an alarm at this ungodly hour might drive him to do something
desperate, and also that all three investigators needed repose, the old
gentleman gave way and permitted himself to be taken home to Staple Inn.

==> Wimsey went round to Parker’s flat in Great Ormond Street to have a <==
drink before turning in, and the session was prolonged till the small
hours had begun to grow into big hours and the early workmen were
abroad.

I wished to do so, but permitted myself to be persuaded against my
better judgement. It will be a lesson to me.’

He sat down, panting a little.

==> ‘My dear Mr Murbles,’ said Wimsey pleasantly, ‘your method of recalling <==
one to the dull business of the day is as delightful as it is
unexpected. Anything better calculated to dispel that sluggish feeling I
can scarcely imagine. But, pardon me—you are somewhat out of breath.
Bunter! a whisky-and-soda for Mr Murbles.’

‘Robert Fentiman,’ announced Mr Murbles impressively, ‘has disappeared.’

He thumped his umbrella.

==> ‘Good God!’ said Wimsey. <==

‘He has gone,’ repeated the solicitor. ‘At ten o’clock this morning I
attended in person at his rooms in Richmond—in _person_—in order to
bring him the more effectually to a sense of his situation. I rang the
bell, I asked for him. The maid told me he had left the night before. I

going nor how soon he would return. I left a note addressed to him, and
hastened back to Dover Street. The flat there was shut up and
untenanted. The man Woodward was nowhere to be found. I then came
immediately to you. And I find you—’

==> Mr Murbles waved an expressive hand at Wimsey, who was just taking from <==
Bunter’s hands a chaste silver tray, containing a Queen Anne coffee pot
and milk jug and a small pile of correspondence.

‘So you do,’ said Wimsey. ‘A depraved sight, I am afraid. H’m! It looks
very much as though Robert had got wind of trouble and didn’t like to

very much as though Robert had got wind of trouble and didn’t like to

He sipped his _café au lait_ delicately, his rather bird-like face
cocked sideways. ‘But why worry? He can’t have got very far.’

‘Well, I’m damned!’

‘The man must be mistaken, Lord Peter.’

==> ‘I jolly well hope so,’ said Wimsey, rather red in the face. ‘It’ll be a <==
bit galling to have Oliver turning up, just when we’ve proved so
conclusively that he doesn’t exist. Paris! I suppose he means that
Fentiman spotted the right man at Waterloo and lost him on the train or
in the rush for the boat. And got hold of Postlethwaite instead. Funny.
Meanwhile, Fentiman’s off to France. Probably taken the 10.30 boat to

Folkestone. I don’t know how we’re to get hold of him.’

‘How very extraordinary!’ said Mr Murbles. ‘Where does that detective
person write from?’

==> ‘Just “Paris”,’ said Wimsey. ‘Bad paper and worse ink. And a small stain <==
of _vin ordinaire_. Probably written in some little café yesterday
afternoon. Not much hope there. But he’s certain to let me know where
they get to.’

‘We must send someone to Paris immediately in search of them,’ declared

don’t find Robert for a few days and the old boy has to be dug up after
all, it won’t make things any worse. Will it?’

Mr Murbles agreed dubiously.

==> ‘Then I’ll pull the old carcase together,’ said Wimsey brightly, <==
flinging the bedclothes aside and leaping to his feet, ‘and toddle off
to the City of Light. Will you excuse me for a few moments, sir? The
bath awaits me. Bunter, put a few things into a suitcase and be ready to
come with me to Paris.’

==> On second thoughts, Wimsey waited till the next day, hoping, as he <==
explained, to hear from the detective. As nothing reached him, however,
he started in pursuit, instructing the head office of Sleuths
Incorporated to wire any information received to him at the Hotel
Meurice. The next news that arrived from him was a card to Mr Murbles
written on a P.L.M. express, which said simply:

[line number in individual story] matching line = 4944    window = 4939 4949

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 32534    window = 32529 32539



In reply to this, Mr Murbles wired:

    ‘Exhumation fixed for day after tomorrow. Please make haste.’

==> To which Wimsey replied: <==

    ‘Returning for exhumation.—P.W.’

He returned alone.


[line number in individual story] matching line = 4952    window = 4947 4957

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 32542    window = 32537 32547



He returned alone.

‘Where is Robert Fentiman?’ demanded Mr Murbles agitatedly.

==> Wimsey, his hair matted damply and his face white from travelling day <==
and night, grinned feebly.

‘I rather fancy,’ he said in a wan voice, ‘that Oliver is at his old
tricks again.’


[line number in individual story] matching line = 4986    window = 4981 4991

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 32576    window = 32571 32581



Dr Penberthy also appeared abstracted and anxious to get the business
over. He made the journey to the cemetery ensconced in the farthest
corner of the big limousine, and discussed thyroid abnormalities with Dr
Horner, Sir James Lubbock’s assistant, who had come to help with the
==> autopsy. Mr Murbles was, naturally, steeped in gloom. Wimsey devoted <==
himself to his accumulated correspondence, out of which one letter only
had any bearing on the Fentiman case. It was from Marjorie Phelps, and
ran:

    ‘If you want to meet Ann Dorland, would you care to come along

    and alter your face, or something. Do come, because if you don’t
    I shall be fastened on by some deadly bore or other—and I shall
    have to hear all Naomi’s raptures about the man, which will be
    too awful.’

==> Wimsey made a note to be present at this enlivening party, and looking <==
round, saw that they were arriving at the Necropolis—so vast, so
glittering with crystal-globed wreaths, so towering with sky-scraping
monuments, that no lesser name would serve it. At the gate they were met
by Mr Pritchard in person (acidulated in his manner and elaborately
polite to Mr Murbles), and by the Home Office representative (suave and

matter of form—and sections of the rest—yes—better have a look at the
brain while we are about it, I suppose. Have you got the large saw?’

‘How callous these medical men seem,’ murmured Mr Murbles.

==> ‘It’s nothing to them,’ said Wimsey. ‘Horner does this kind of job <==
several times a week.’

‘Yes, but he need not be so noisy. Dr Penberthy behaves with decorum.’

‘Penberthy runs a practice,’ said Wimsey with a faint grin. ‘He has to

‘It’s nothing to them,’ said Wimsey. ‘Horner does this kind of job

‘Yes, but he need not be so noisy. Dr Penberthy behaves with decorum.’

==> ‘Penberthy runs a practice,’ said Wimsey with a faint grin. ‘He has to <==
exercise a little restraint over himself. Besides, he knew old Fentiman,
and Horner didn’t.’

At length the relevant portions of General Fentiman’s anatomy having
been collected into suitable jars and bottles, the body was returned to

and Horner didn’t.’

At length the relevant portions of General Fentiman’s anatomy having
been collected into suitable jars and bottles, the body was returned to
==> the coffin and screwed down. Penberthy came across to Wimsey and took <==
his arm.

‘We ought to be able to get a pretty good idea of what you want to
know,’ he said. ‘Decomposition is very little advanced, owing to an
exceptionally well-made coffin. By the way’ (he dropped his voice),

[line number in individual story] matching line = 5072    window = 5067 5077

know,’ he said. ‘Decomposition is very little advanced, owing to an
exceptionally well-made coffin. By the way’ (he dropped his voice),
‘that leg, you know—did it ever occur to you—or rather, did you ever
discover any explanation of that?’

==> ‘I _did_ have an idea about it,’ admitted Wimsey, ‘but I don’t yet know <==
whether it was the right one. I shall probably know for certain in a day
or two.’

‘You think the body was interfered with?’ said Penberthy, looking him
steadily in the face.

[line number in individual story] matching line = 5079    window = 5074 5084

or two.’

‘You think the body was interfered with?’ said Penberthy, looking him
steadily in the face.

==> ‘Yes, and so do you,’ replied Wimsey, returning the gaze. <==

‘I’ve had my suspicions all the time, of course. I told you so, you
know. I wonder whether—you don’t think I was wrong to give the
certificate, do you?’


[line number in individual story] matching line = 5086    window = 5081 5091

‘I’ve had my suspicions all the time, of course. I told you so, you
know. I wonder whether—you don’t think I was wrong to give the
certificate, do you?’

‘Not unless you suspected anything wrong with the death itself,’ said
==> Wimsey. ‘Have you and Horner noticed anything queer?’ <==

‘No. But—oh, well! having a patient dug up always makes me worried, you
know. It’s easy to make a mistake, and one looks an awful fool in court.
I’d hate being made to look a fool just at present,’ added the doctor
with a nervous laugh. ‘I’m thinking of—Great Scott, man! how you

Tuesday—Lord Peter walked briskly into Mr Murbles’s chambers in Staple
Inn, with Detective-Inspector Parker at his heels.

‘Good morning,’ said Mr Murbles, surprised.

==> ‘Good morning,’ said Wimsey. ‘Hark! hark! the lark at heaven’s gate <==
sings. He is coming, my own, my sweet, were it ever so airy a tread. He
will be here in a quarter of an hour.’

‘Who will?’ demanded Mr Murbles, somewhat severely.

opening roar.’

It was, indeed, the voice of Robert Fentiman, not in the best of
tempers. In a few seconds he was shown in. He nodded curtly to Mr
Murbles, who replied with a stiff bow, and then turned violently upon
==> Wimsey. <==

‘Look here, what’s the meaning of all this? Here’s that damned detective
fellow of yours leading me a devil of a dance all over Europe and home
again, and then this morning he suddenly turns round and tells me that
you want to see me here with news about Oliver. What the devil do you

fellow of yours leading me a devil of a dance all over Europe and home
again, and then this morning he suddenly turns round and tells me that
you want to see me here with news about Oliver. What the devil do you
know about Oliver?’

==> ‘Oliver?’ said Wimsey. ‘Oh, yes—he’s an elusive personality. Almost as <==
elusive in Rome as he was in London. Wasn’t it odd, Fentiman, the way he
always seemed to bob up directly your back was turned? Wasn’t it funny,
the way he managed to disappear from places the moment you set foot in
’em? Almost like the way he used to hang about Gatti’s and then give you
and me the slip. Did you have a jolly time abroad, old man? I suppose

‘Has this detective vouchsafed any explanation of his extraordinary
behaviour, in keeping us in the dark for nearly a fortnight as to his
movements?’

==> ‘I’m afraid I owe you the explanation,’ said Wimsey airily. ‘You see, I <==
thought it was time the carrot was dangled before the other donkey. I
knew that if we pretended to find Oliver in Paris, Fentiman would be in
honour bound to chase after him. In fact, he was probably only too
pleased to get away—weren’t you, Fentiman?’

pleased. But when the hare started to double back to England, home and
beauty, I began to get the idea that somebody was pullin’ my leg. By the
way, was that why I was able to get all my _visas_ with that uncanny
facility at an unearthly hour overnight?’

==> ‘It was,’ said Wimsey modestly. <==

‘I might have known there was something wrong about it. You devil!
Well—what now? If you’ve exploded Oliver, I suppose you’ve spilled all
the rest of the beans, eh?’

bloodhound like you on the trail. But it was fun while it lasted. Even
now, the thought of old Bunter solemnly callin’ up two and a half
columns of Olivers makes me shout with joy. It’s almost as good as
getting the half-million.’

==> ‘That reminds me,’ said Wimsey. ‘The one thing I don’t know is how you <==
knew about the half-million. Did Lady Dormer tell you about her will? Or
did you hear of it from George?’

‘George? Great Scott, no! George knew nothing about it. The old boy told
me himself.’

‘General Fentiman?’

‘Of course. When he came back to the Club that night, he came straight
up to see me.’

suppose.’

‘You can’t be expected to think of everything,’ said Robert
condescendingly. ‘I think you did very well, take it all round. Yes—the
old boy toddled up to me and told me all about it. He said I wasn’t to

might say. In three minutes I’d lugged him along and stuck him up on the
seat, and then I hopped back to write a label for the door. I say, I
thought I was jolly smart to remember not to blot that label on the
library blotting-paper.’

==> ‘Believe me,’ said Wimsey, ‘I appreciated that point.’ <==

‘Good. I’m glad you did. Well, it was pretty plain sailing after that. I
got the guv’nor’s togs from the cloak-room and took ’em up to my room,
and then I thought about old Woodward sittin’ up waitin’ for him. So I
trundled out and went down to Charing Cross—how do you think?’

‘I perceive,’ replied Mr Murbles icily, ‘that any appeal to your better

fraud is a penal offence.’

‘This came last night,’ he said. ‘And, by Jove, my lad, it’s lucky for
you that you had a good bit to lose by the old man’s death. This is from
Lubbock:

Mr Murbles sat petrified.

known—if I’d had the faintest idea—I wouldn’t have touched the body
for twenty millions. Poison! Poor old blighter! What a damned shame! I
remember now his saying that night he felt a bit sickish, but I never

he said, ‘and you’ve handled it finely, Peter. I didn’t know you had it

putting pressure on Major Fentiman was simply masterly! Pretty work!
Pretty work!’

eye.’

And at this remark, even Mr Murbles showed signs of returning animation.

A hasty consultation with the powers that be at Scotland Yard put
Detective-Inspector Parker in charge of the Fentiman case, and he

‘What put you on to this poison business?’ he asked.

‘Aristotle, chiefly,’ replied Wimsey. ‘He says, you know, that one

‘That’s in his favour, if anything,’ said Parker cheerfully, ‘unless
he’s very reckless indeed.’

‘My dear man!’

‘I beg your pardon. I was forgetting for the moment. I’m afraid you are
getting a little above your job, Charles. So much intelligence will

‘You’re scintillating with good plots today, Peter. If they quarrelled,
he might possibly have knocked his grandfather down—though I don’t
think he’d do such a rotten and unsportsmanlike thing—but he surely
wouldn’t have poisoned him.’

==> Wimsey sighed. <==

‘There’s something in what you say,’ he admitted. ‘Still, you never
know. Now then, is there any name we’ve thought of which appears in all
three columns of our list?’

‘You can trust your father. And, I say, you might take me down to the
Bellona in a tactful way. I’d like to ask a question or two there.’

‘I shall be asked to resign if this goes on. Not that it’s much loss.
But it would please Wetheridge so much to see the back of me. Never

The entrance of the Bellona Club was filled with an unseemly confusion.
Culyer was arguing heatedly with a number of men, and three or four
members of the committee stood beside him with brows as black as

This was agreed and, a suitable paragraph having been provided by

He’s fearfully keen on glands and things, so I’ve brought him along.
And, Naomi, do tell me all about your news. Who is it? Do I know him?’

Mrs Rushworth was a long, untidy woman, with long, untidy hair wound
into bell-pushes over her ears. She beamed short-sightedly at Peter.

character is so interesting, you know. Are you devoted to young
criminals, by any chance?’

‘How very true. So perplexing. And just to think that we have been quite
wrong about them all these thousands of years. Flogging and
bread-and-water, you know, and Holy Communion, when what they really
needed was a little bit of rabbit-gland or something to make them just

and they come right again. Though I dare say they make a great deal more
money as they are, which throws such a distressing light on
unemployment, does it not?’

‘Yes, indeed,’ agreed Mrs Rushworth. ‘But I think it is so infinitely
more heartening to look at it from the opposite point of view.
Everything has the qualities of its defects, too, has it not? It is so

important to see these things in their true light. It will be such a joy
for Naomi to be able to help dear Walter in this great work. I hope you
will feel eager to subscribe to the establishment of the new Clinic.’

==> Wimsey asked, what new Clinic. <==

‘Oh! hasn’t Marjorie told you about it? The new Clinic to make everybody
good by glands. That is what dear Walter is going to speak about. He is
so keen, and so is Naomi. It was such a joy to me when Naomi told me
that they were really engaged, you know. Not that her old mother hadn’t

that they were really engaged, you know. Not that her old mother hadn’t
suspected something, of course,’ added Mrs Rushworth archly. But young
people are so odd nowadays, and keep their affairs so much to
themselves.’

==> Wimsey said that he thought both parties were heartily to be <==
congratulated. And indeed, from what he had seen of Naomi Rushworth, he
felt that she at least deserved congratulation, for she was a singularly
plain girl, with a face like a weasel.

He got up quickly. Father Whittington was approaching with Penberthy.

‘Well,’ said Lord Peter, ‘have the altars reeled?’

‘Not at all. Why should I? So long as they _are_ cast out. And provided
you are certain of your diagnosis.’

Penberthy crimsoned and turned away sharply.

==> ‘Oh, lord!’ said Wimsey. ‘That was a nasty one. From a Christian priest, <==
too!’

‘What have I said?’ cried Father Whittington, much disconcerted.

‘You have reminded Science,’ said Wimsey, ‘that only the Pope is

that, and the dabs of paint on the palette were still soft and sticky.
Work had been done there within the last two days, he was sure. The
brushes had been stuck at random into a small pot of turpentine. He
lifted them out; they were still clogged with paint. The picture itself
was a landscape, he thought, roughly drawn and hot and restless in
==> colour. Parker was no judge of art; he would have liked to get Wimsey’s <==
opinion. He explored further. The table with the Bunsen burner was bare,
but in a cupboard close by he discovered a quantity of chemical
apparatus of the kind he remembered using at school. Everything had been
tidily washed and stacked away. Nellie’s job, he imagined. There were a
number of simple and familiar chemical substances in jars and packages

Parker considered this apparent _non sequitur_ for a few moments, and
gave it up.

‘George Fentiman—’ he began.

==> ‘Yes,’ said Wimsey, ‘George Fentiman. I must be getting emotional in my <==
old age, Charles, for I have an unconquerable dislike to examining the
question of George Fentiman’s opportunities.’

‘Bar Robert,’ pursued Parker ruthlessly, ‘he was the last interested
person to see General Fentiman.’

‘Yes—by the way, we have only Robert’s unsupported word for what
happened in that last interview between him and the old man.’

==> ‘Come, Wimsey—you’re not going to pretend that Robert had any interest <==
in his grandfather’s dying before Lady Dormer. On the contrary.’

‘No—but he might have had some interest in his dying before he made a
will. Those notes on that bit of paper. The larger share was to go to
George. That doesn’t entirely agree with what Robert said. And if there

one devoted to those who tempt others to murder them. I wash my hands of
this case, Charles. There’s nothing for me to do now you have come into
it. It bores and annoys me. Let’s talk about something else.’

==> Wimsey might wash his hands, but, like Pontius Pilate, he found society <==
irrationally determined to connect him with an irritating and
unsatisfactory case.

At midnight the telephone bell rang.

‘Oh, Hades!’

Bunter advanced gently with his master’s dressing-gown and slippers.

‘Hallo!’

‘Is that Lord Peter?—Oh, _good_!’ The line sighed with relief—a harsh

‘Yes, please . . . oh, don’t cut us off . . . wait . . . oh! I haven’t
any more pennies . . . Lord Peter . . .’

‘Oh, thank you—thank you so much!’

‘I say—where’s Robert?’

‘Your six minutes are up,’ said the voice finally, and the line went
dead with a metallic crash.

despicable rags which I hoped to have put off for ever. Get me a taxi.
Get me a drink. Macbeth has murdered sleep. Oh! and get me Robert
Fentiman, first.’

Major Fentiman was not in town, said Woodward. He had gone back to

Major Fentiman was not in town, said Woodward. He had gone back to
==> Richmond again. Wimsey tried to get through to Richmond. After a long <==
time, a female voice, choked with sleep and fury, replied. Major
Fentiman had not come home. Major Fentiman kept very late hours. Would
she give Major Fentiman a message when he did come in? Indeed she would
not. She had other things to do than to stay up all night answering
telephone calls and giving messages to Major Fentiman. This was the

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 34741    window = 34736 34746


Would she leave a note for Major Fentiman, asking him to go round to his
brother’s house at once? Well, now, was it reasonable to expect her to
sit up on a bitter cold night writing letters? Of course not; but this
was a case of urgent illness. It would be a very great kindness. Just
that—to go round to his brother’s house and say the call came from Lord

‘Who?’

‘Lord Peter Wimsey.’

that—to go round to his brother’s house and say the call came from Lord
Peter Wimsey.

‘Who?’

==> ‘Lord Peter Wimsey.’ <==

‘Very well, sir. I beg your pardon if I was a bit short, but really—’

‘You weren’t, you snobby old cat, you were infernally long,’ breathed
his lordship inaudibly. He thanked her, and rang off.

‘Oh, it is good of you! I’m so worried. I say, don’t make a noise, will
you? They complain, you know.’ She spoke in a harassed whisper.

==> ‘Blast them, let them complain,’ said Wimsey cheerfully. ‘Why shouldn’t <==
you make a row when George is upset? Besides, if we whisper, they’ll
think we’re no better than we ought to be. Now, my child, what’s all
this? You’re as cold as a _pêche Melba_. That won’t do. Fire half
out—where’s the whisky?’

from my warm bed and going into the cold night air doesn’t suit me.’ He
flung a generous shovelful of coals on the fire and thrust the poker
between the bars. ‘And you’ve had no grub. No wonder you’re feeling
awful.’

==> Two places were set at the table—untouched—waiting for George. Wimsey <==
plunged into the kitchen premises, followed by Sheila uttering agitated
remonstrances. He found some disagreeable remnants—a watery stew, cold
and sodden; a basin half-full of some kind of tinned soup; a chill suet
pudding put away on a shelf.

‘No, no, I’ll do that. You sit down and—I mean, sorry, _take_ the
kettle. Fill it, light the gas, put it on. And tell me about George.’

The trouble, it seemed, had begun at breakfast. Ever since the story of
the murder had come out, George had been very nervy and jumpy, and, to
==> Sheila’s horror, had ‘started muttering again.’ ‘Muttering’, Wimsey <==
remembered, had formerly been the prelude to one of George’s ‘queer
fits’. These had been a form of shell-shock, and they had generally
ended in his going off and wandering about in a distraught manner for
several days, sometimes with partial and occasionally with complete
temporary loss of memory. There was the time when he had been found

policemen and then heard them inquiring for George. Mr Munns ushered
them into the front room with a grim face on which ‘police’ seemed
written in capital letters. George—

At this point the kettle boiled. Sheila was taking it off the stove to
==> make the Bovril, when Wimsey became aware of a hand on his coat-collar. <==
He looked round into the face of a gentleman who appeared not to have
shaved for several days.

‘Now then,’ said this apparition, ‘what’s the meaning of this?’

‘Drink?’ cried Mrs Munns on a high note; ‘the impudence! And if I see
you, Joe, giving drinks to thieves and worse in the middle of the night
in my kitchen, you’ll get a piece of my mind. Coming in here as bold as
brass, and the Captain run away, and asking for drink—’

==> ‘Because,’ said Wimsey, fingering his note-case, ‘the public-houses in <==
this law-abiding neighbourhood are, of course, closed. Otherwise a
bottle of Scotch—’

Mr Munns appeared to hesitate.

‘Of course,’ said Mr Munns, ‘if I was to go in a friendly manner to
Jimmy Rowe at the “Dragon”, and ask him to give me a bottle of Johnnie
Walker as a friend to a friend, and provided no money was to pass
between him and me, that is—’

==> ‘A good idea,’ said Wimsey cordially. <==

Mrs Munns gave a loud shriek.

‘The ladies,’ said Mr Munns, ‘gets nervous at times.’ He shrugged his
shoulders.

He departed. Possibly he forgot what he had said about no money passing,

don’t care what anybody says.’

what you say to me.’

parricides, there’s not a halfpenny to choose between them. Only
parricides aren’t respectable—but then, they’re easier got rid of.’

‘Find? Them find anything? I should like to see them finding things in

get into trouble, not for any number of captains. But interference with
a free-born woman and no search-warrant I will _not_ stand. And they can
either come to me in a fitting way, or they can go and whistle for their
bottle.’

‘The bottle they were looking for in my dustbin, what the Captain put
there after breakfast.’

Sheila gave a faint cry.

really are one, but you meet so many bad characters nowadays that one
can’t be too careful—on account of the lavatory standing out as you may

‘So when I saw the Captain breaking the bottle as I said, and throwing
the bits into the dustbin, ‘Hallo!’ I said, ‘that’s funny,’ and I went
to see what it was and I put it in an envelope, thinking, you see, as it
might be something poisonous, and the cat such a dreadful thief as he

found, same as it might be off that tablet bottle. “Did I know where the
rest of it was?” they said. And I said, what business had they got with
the dustbin at all. So they said—’

And what did you do with the envelope and things?’

‘Not he. Disappeared completely. We shall find the car, of course—it’s

‘Yes.’

‘What have you done to your face, old man?’

it down again. ‘This one, for instance, is all about a bloke who
murdered somebody and kept him in cold storage till he was ready to
dispose of him. It would suit Robert Fentiman.’

‘These,’ he said, ‘are the paintings of a completely untalented person,

Parker had brought forward the head of the sallow, squinting man which

‘Put that up on the easel. That’s very interesting. The others, you see,

you can’t draw. Cover up one eye, Charles—not yours, the portrait’s.’

Parker did so.

after all. But, whoever it is, surely this room tells you something.’

‘Do you want to come with me to the Armstrong woman?’

Nurse Armstrong belonged to an expensive nursing-home in Great Wimpole

previous evening from escorting an invalid lady to Italy. She was a
large, good-looking, imperturbable woman, rather like the Venus of Milo,

‘She was never alone with him?’

‘Not for a moment.’

had not spoken for so long that Parker quite started.

‘She was always very pleasant to me,’ said Nurse Armstrong. ‘I shouldn’t

‘Did she ever mention Lady Dormer’s testamentary arrangements in your

train of thought.

‘Well—not exactly. But I remember her once talking about her painting,

Parker opened his mouth and shut it again.

‘How long did you stay on at the house after Lady Dormer died?’ pursued

‘I waited on till after the funeral, just in case Miss Dorland should
need anybody.’

‘Before you left, did you hear anything of this trouble about the

‘No. I said I went hoping to meet her, but she wasn’t there.’

‘Oh, I see. Well, that’ll do for the moment. How about a spot of lunch?’

At which point they turned the corner and ran slap into Salcombe Hardy,

‘I’ve remembered,’ he said.

‘What?’

‘Who that portrait reminds me of. Tell you later.’

‘Maybe,’ said Parker cautiously. ‘But that’s a hard thing to prove. We
know, of course, that they both sometimes went to Mrs Rushworth’s house,
but there’s no evidence that they knew each other well.’

snap. ‘No, I won’t. Fish it out for yourselves.’

Illumination was flooding in on him in great waves. Each point of light
touched off a myriad others. Now a date was lit up, and now a sentence.

‘He says he just knows her to speak to. But one’s got to find somebody
who has seen them together. You remember the Thompson case. It was the
interview in the teashop that clinched it.’

‘Why what?’

‘Why didn’t they compromise?’ It was not what he had been going to say,
but he felt defeated, and those words would end the sentence as well as

‘They _did_ agree to compromise in the end,’ said Parker. ‘When was
that?’

‘After I told Penberthy there was going to be an exhumation,’ said
==> Wimsey, as though in spite of himself. <==

‘There you are! They saw it was getting too dangerous.’

‘Do you remember how nervous Penberthy was at the exhumation?’ said
Parker. ‘That man—what’s his name?—his joke about Palmer, and knocking

clinic. In order not to make it too obvious, she has to pretend to get a
dickens of an interest in glands. So she drops painting and takes to
medicine. What could be clearer?’

will at least a year ago.’

‘Why not?’

‘Well, that brings us back to the old question: why the delay?’

‘And it gives us the answer,’ said Parker. ‘They waited till the
interest in the glands and things was so firmly established and
recognised by everybody that nobody would connect it with the General’s
death.’

a bewildering rate. But George was safe, anyhow.

‘How soon do you think you’ll be able to take action?’ asked Hardy. ‘I
suppose you’ll want a bit more solid proof before you actually arrest

The others stared at him.

‘How do you know that?’ demanded Parker annoyed.

_have_ you been doing, old boy?’

‘Interviewing the Rushworth’s,’ said Waffles, edging his way into a
chair by Hardy. He was a thin, sandy person, with a tired manner. Hardy

‘Got your story in?’

‘Oh, yes. Awful lot of cats these women are. Ma Rushworth—she’s the

man.’

‘We’ll have to put the stopper on this marriage business, quick,’ said
Parker, madly waving to a taxi, which swooped past and ignored him. ‘I

and we can’t take her evidence. Devil of it is, if she’s determined to
go on with it, we can’t stop it without arresting Penberthy. Very
dangerous, when there’s no real proof. I think we’d better have him down
to the Yard for interrogation and detain him.’

A taxi drew up.

‘What?’ said Parker sharply, with his foot on the step. ‘I can’t wait,
old man, what is it?’

have got the right solution, but the working of the sum’s all wrong.
Same as mine used to be at school, when I’d looked up the answer in the
crib and had to fudge in the middle part. I’ve been a fool. I ought to

For some reason, the word ‘artistic’ produces the most alarming
reactions in people who know anything about art.

I’m an ordinary person, and have met women, and talked to them like
ordinary human beings—’

‘You and your women,’ said Parker rudely.

‘I don’t despair of getting all the evidence necessary,’ said Parker
coldly, ‘provided you don’t keep me here _all_ day.’ He slammed the taxi
door.

==> ‘What a beast of a case this is,’ thought Wimsey. ‘That makes two silly, <==
sordid rows today. Well, what next?’ He considered a moment.

‘My spirit needs soothing,’ he decided. ‘Feminine society is indicated.
Virtuous feminine society. No emotions. I’ll go and have tea with
Marjorie Phelps.’

The girl fell back from the doorway and let him pass. He laid his hat

walked over to the fireplace and stood with one hand on the mantelpiece.

modelling-board, and raised the wet cloth that covered the little mound
of clay.

He was gazing with an assumption of great interest at the half-modelled
figure of an old flower-seller, when the girl said:

‘Nor am I. I wish I were.’

‘Yes—that would keep one’s mind off things with a vengeance. Draughts
or dominoes or patience would be even better. No connection with

grinding and hateful had happened to me. I played patience all day. I
was in a nursing home—with shell-shock—and other things. I only played
one game, the very simplest . . . the demon . . . a silly game with no

‘Then you, too . . .’

‘It’s a kind of drug, of course. That’s an awfully trite thing to say,

‘Yes, quite.’

She moved restlessly.

‘It usually is a man, isn’t it?’

Her eyes were turned away from him, and she answered with a kind of
shamefaced defiance.

‘Depends what it is.’

‘One gets over everything,’ repeated Wimsey firmly. ‘Particularly if one
tells somebody about it.’

Ann Dorland suddenly laughed.

as a compliment . . . But obviously you don’t. What exact form of mania
did he suggest . . . ?’

‘Oh! the gibbering sort that hangs round church doors for curates,’ she
broke out fiercely. ‘It’s a lie. He did—he _did_—pretend to—want me

She was back on the couch, crying, with large, ugly, streaming tears,

‘Poor kid,’ he said. This, then, was at the back of Marjorie’s
mysterious hints, and those scratch-cat sneers of Naomi Rushworth’s. The
girl had wanted love affairs, that was certain; imagined them, perhaps.
There had been Ambrose Ledbury. Between the normal and the abnormal, the

‘Were you keen on him then?’

‘No. I—well, I was keen on somebody else. Only that was a mistake too.
He—he was one of those people, you know.’

==> ‘They can’t help themselves,’ said Wimsey, soothingly. ‘When did the <==
change-over happen?’

‘The other man went away. And later on Dr Penberthy—oh! I don’t know!
He walked home with me once or twice, and then he asked me to dine with
him—in Soho.’

‘He made out he was fond of me,’ she said miserably.

‘Of course, my dear child; your case is not unique. Didn’t you tell any
of your friends?’

==> ‘No.’ Wimsey reflected that the Ledbury episode had probably left a <==
scar. Besides—did women tell things to other women? He had long doubted
it.

‘You were still engaged when Lady Dormer died, I take it?’

‘He told me he thought there would be some attempt to make it seem later
than it really was. I thought it was _you_ who were trying to hush
everything up. And I was so furious that, of course, I told Mr Pritchard
to have a proper inquiry made and on no account to compromise.’

==> ‘Thank God you did,’ said Wimsey. <==

‘Why?’

‘I’ll tell you presently. But Penberthy now—I can’t think why _he_
didn’t persuade you to compromise. That would have made him absolutely

absolutely impossible for you to claim him publicly. And he bolstered it
up by engaging himself to the Rushworth female.’

‘He didn’t care how _I_ suffered.’

was a perfectly diabolical thing to do. I dare say he’s feeling pretty
rotten about it.’

Ann Dorland clenched her hands.

‘No—but—’ A thought seemed to strike her. ‘Lord Peter—I can’t _prove_
a word of this. Everybody will think I was in league with him. And
they’ll think that our quarrel and his getting engaged to Naomi was just
a put-up job between us to get us both out of a difficulty.’

==> ‘You’ve got brains,’ said Wimsey admiringly. ‘_Now_ you see why I <==

make it pretty certain that you weren’t an accessory before the fact,

He released her and went out to meet Marjorie Phelps at the door.

‘Lord Peter! Good lord!’

old man—the truth about the will—the opportunity. And then,
upsettingly Robert . . . Would the jury see it like that?

Savoy. When they arrived, he handed the girl over to the cloak-room
attendant. ‘I am going up to change,’ he added, and, turning, had the

be settled without reference to Fentiman and his delusions. There’s only

He hasn’t got two ideas in his head, and he’s perfectly happy where he

ought to be grateful to me in a way. I’ve secured her the money,
anyhow.’

reminded him.

‘That’s true. All right. I’ll put it all on paper for you. Give me half
an hour, will you?’

reminded him.

‘That’s true. All right. I’ll put it all on paper for you. Give me half

He left the library and wandered into the smoking-room. Colonel
Marchbanks was there, and greeted him with a friendly smile.

‘Glad you’re here, Colonel. Mind if I come and chat to you for a

moment?’

‘By all means, my dear boy. I’m in no hurry to get home. My wife’s away.
What can I do for you?’

==> Wimsey told him, in a lowered voice. The Colonel was distressed. <==

‘Ah, well,’ he said, ‘you’ve done the best thing, to my mind. I look at
these matters from a soldier’s point of view, of course. Much better to
make a clean job of it all. Dear, dear! Sometimes, Lord Peter, I think
that the War has had a bad effect on some of our young men. But then, of

in a way that is to me quite incomprehensible. I can understand a man’s
committing murder in hot blood—but poisoning—and then putting a good,
lady-like girl into such an equivocal position—no! I fail to understand
it. Still, as you say, the right course is being taken at last.’

==> ‘Yes,’ said Wimsey. <==

‘Excuse me for a moment,’ said the Colonel, and went out.

When he returned, he went with Wimsey into the library. Penberthy had
finished writing and was reading his statement through.

‘Will that do?’ he asked.

Wimsey read it, Colonel Marchbanks looking over the pages with him.

‘Thank you,’ said Penberthy.

The Colonel closed the drawer slowly, stepped back a couple of paces,

moment, then took the Colonel’s arm. Their shadows moved, lengthened,
shortened, doubled and crossed as they passed the seven lights in the
seven bays of the library. The door shut after them.

‘How about a drink, Colonel?’ said Wimsey.

some very decent shooting. We’re having a sort of house party; my wife,
you know—must have all these young people round—awful crowd of women.
But I’m getting one or two men who can play bridge and handle a gun, and
it would be a positive charity to see me through. Deadly season,

‘I say, you fellows,’ he cried, ‘here’s another unpleasantness.
Penberthy’s shot himself in the library. People ought to have more
consideration for the members. Where’s Culyer?’

==> Wimsey pushed his way out into the entrance-hall. There, as he had <==
expected, he found the plainclothes detective who had been told off to
shadow Penberthy.

‘Send for Inspector Parker,’ he said. ‘I have a paper to give him. Your
job’s over; it’s the end of the case.’

‘Oh! there was a long argument. Miss Dorland insisted on dividing the

a woman of intelligence and character. I may not be highbrow, but I have

                        LORD PETER LEADS A CLUB


==> ‘You are quite sure this suit is all right, Bunter?’ said Lord Peter <==
anxiously.

It was an easy lounge suit, tweedy in texture, and a trifle more
pronounced in colour and pattern than Wimsey usually permitted himself.
While not unsuitable for town wear, it yet diffused a faint suggestion

‘I want to look approachable,’ he went on, ‘but on no account loud. I
can’t help wondering whether that stripe of invisible green wouldn’t
have looked better if it had been a remote purple.’

==> This suggestion seemed to disconcert Bunter. There was a pause while he <==
visualised a remote purple stripe. At length, however, the palpitating
balance of his mind seemed to settle definitely down.

‘No, my lord,’ he said firmly. ‘I do not think purple would be an
improvement. Interesting—yes; but, if I may so express myself,

appearance of being several months old.’

‘Oh, all right. Well, give me the malacca with the foot-rule marked on
it—and where’s my lens?’

==> ‘Here, my lord.’ Bunter produced an innocent-looking monocle, which was, <==
in reality, a powerful magnifier. ‘And the fingerprint powder is in your
lordship’s right-hand coat pocket.’

‘Thanks. Well, I think that’s all. I’ll go on now, and I want you to
follow on with the doings in about an hour’s time.’

extracted the paper. It bore a few scrawls relating to sums of money,
very carelessly and shakily written. Wimsey looked at it attentively for
a moment or two, and shook the blotter to see if it held anything
further. Then he folded the sheet, handling it with extreme care by the
corners, put it in an envelope and filed it away in his note-case.
==> Coming out of the library, he found Bunter waiting in the hall, camera <==
and tripod in hand.

‘Ah, here you are, Bunter. Just a minute, while I see the Secretary.’ He
looked in at the office, and found Culyer immersed in some accounts.

inconsiderate way a little time ago?’

‘Oh, right-o! What d’you want done?’

‘Certainly.’

A servant was sent to fetch Bunter, who came in looking imperturbably

all right, but you haven’t got quite the air of devil-may-care seediness

Wimsey thrust the instrument energetically through the stem of the pipe,
bringing out a revolting collection of brown, oily matter.

‘Nicotine poisoning, Culyer—that’s what you’ll die of if you aren’t
==> jolly careful. Here you are, Bunter. Judiciously smeared upon the <==
fingertips, that should give quite the right effect. Now, look here, Mr
Culyer here will take you round. I want a shot of the smoking-room from
the entrance, a close-up of the fireplace, showing General Fentiman’s
usual chair, and another shot from the door of the ante-room that leads
into the library. Another shot through the ante-room into the library,

‘I don’t think so. But I know she came from Merritt’s, the
undertakers—round Shepherd’s Market way. They’d probably put you on to
her.’

‘Thanks frightfully, Culyer. I’ll make myself scarce now. Carry on,
==> Bunter.’ <==

Wimsey thought for a moment; then strolled across to the smoking-room,
exchanged a mute greeting with one or two of the assembled veterans,
picked up the _Morning Post_, and looked round for a seat. The great
armchair with ears still stood before the fire, but some dim feeling of

gave Wimsey considerable satisfaction to see the relentless camera
pursue him into that stronghold.

It was half-past twelve before a waiter approached Lord Peter to say
that Mr Culyer would be glad to speak to him for a moment. In the
==> office, Bunter reported his job done, and was dispatched to get some <==
lunch and a fresh supply of plates. Wimsey presently went down to the
dining-room, where he found Wetheridge already established, getting the
first cut off the saddle of mutton, and grumbling at the wine. Wimsey
went deliberately over, greeted him heartily, and sat down at the same
table.

members who visited the Bellona seldom and liked to ‘have a chat with
Piper’ when they did. He could not recollect seeing the General. Wimsey
began to feel that there must have been a conspiracy to overlook the old
gentleman on the last morning of his life.

==> ‘You don’t think he never was here at all, do you, Bunter?’ he <==
suggested. ‘Walkin’ about invisible and tryin’ hard to communicate, like
the unfortunate ghost in that story of somebody or other’s?’

Bunter was inclined to reject the psychic view of the case.

yell out to you.’

‘Right.’

==> Wimsey went out, leaving him to it, and joined Woodward and Bunter, who <==
were conversing in the next room. A glance told Wimsey that this was the
General’s bedroom.

On a table beside the narrow iron bedstead was an old-fashioned
writing-desk. Wimsey took it up, weighed it in his hands a moment and

‘Well, no—I can’t very well ring up perfect strangers and—’

‘And sing ’em the Froth-Blowers’ Anthem? Good God, man, anybody’d think
you were chasing a lost umbrella, not half a million of money. The man
rang you up, so he may very well be on the phone himself. Better let

find it a positive pleasure to be tr-r-roubled by him.’

Robert Fentiman greeted his feeble pleasantry with an indulgent grin,
and produced the telephone directory, to which Bunter immediately
applied himself. Finding two and a half columns of Olivers, he removed

the receiver and started to work steadily through them in rotation.
Wimsey returned to the bedroom. It was in apple-pie order—the bed
neatly made, the wash-hand apparatus set in order, as though the
occupant might return at any moment, every speck of dust removed—a

Woodward, a trifle pained by this levity, gathered up the garments and
put them away in the wardrobe.

==> ‘How’s Bunter getting on with those calls?’ <==

‘No luck, at present.’

‘Oh!—well, he’d better come in now and do some photographs. We can
finish the telephoning at home. Bunter! Oh, and, I say, Woodward—d’you

well to make sure, as you say. Funny sort of business, what? Quite the

Bunter immediately produced a small inking-pad and roller, and a number
of sheets of smooth, white paper. The fingers of the two candidates were
carefully wiped with a clean cloth, and pressed first on the pad and
then on the paper. The impressions thus obtained were labelled and put

‘Perfectly so, sir; they are quite unlike either of the other two
specimens.’

‘Then presumably they’re the General’s. Hurry up and get a negative.’

a good joke, wouldn’t it?’

What with telephone calls and the development of photographs, it

Piccadilly, and walked abroad to divert himself in his own peculiar way.

His first visit was to one of those offices which undertake to
distribute advertisements to the press. Here he drew up an advertisement

faithful and intelligent man who looks after me like a mother.’

‘Dare say he knows when he’s well off,’ said George disagreeably.

together, and after the whole thing was over I hunted him up and took
him on. He was in service before that, of course, but his former master
was killed and the family broken up, so he was quite pleased to come
along. I don’t know what I should do without Bunter now.’

At six o’clock, he presented himself at Mr Murbles’s chambers in Staple

==> ‘I don’t often prophesy, Bunter, but I’m going to do it now. Your <==
fortune told by hands or cards. Beware of the dark stranger. That sort
of thing.’

‘Indeed, my lord?’

‘Indeed, my lord?’

‘Cross the gipsy’s palm with silver. I see Mr Oliver. I see him taking a
journey in which he will cross water. I see trouble. I see the ace of
==> spades—upside-down, Bunter.’ <==

‘And what then, my lord?’

‘Nothing. I look into the future and I see a blank. The gipsy has
spoken.’

‘Certainly, my lord.’

‘What price the gipsy’s warning now?’ said Lord Peter, as he
==> communicated this piece of intelligence to Bunter. <==

Major Fentiman came round to the flat that afternoon, in a whirl of
apology and indignation.

‘I’m sorry, old man. It was damned stupid of me, but I lost my temper.

‘Think of the money,’ grinned Wimsey, shutting the door of the flat upon
him.

He returned to the library, balancing the two letters in his hand.
‘There’s many a man now walking the streets of London,’ said he,
==> ‘through not clearing trumps. Take these letters to the post, Bunter. <==
And Mr Parker will be dining here with me this evening. We will have a
_perdrix aux choux_ and a savoury to follow, and you can bring up two
bottles of the Chambertin.’

‘Very good, my lord.’

==> Having sent this off, his lordship rang for Bunter. <==

‘Bunter, as you know, I seldom drink champagne. But I am inclined to do
so now. Bring a glass for yourself as well.’

The cork popped merrily, and Lord Peter rose to his feet.

Lord Peter, having set the springe for his woodcock, slept the sleep of
the just until close upon eleven o’clock the next morning. He was
aroused by voices without, and presently his bedroom door was flung open
to admit Mr Murbles, of all people, in a high state of agitation,
==> followed by Bunter, protesting. <==

‘Hallo, sir!’ said his lordship, much amazed. ‘What’s up?’

‘We have been outwitted,’ cried Mr Murbles, waving his umbrella, ‘we
have been forestalled! We should have gone to Major Fentiman last night.

‘My dear Mr Murbles,’ said Wimsey pleasantly, ‘your method of recalling

unexpected. Anything better calculated to dispel that sluggish feeling I
can scarcely imagine. But, pardon me—you are somewhat out of breath.

‘Indeed no!’ ejaculated the solicitor hurriedly. ‘I couldn’t touch it.
Lord Peter—’

‘A glass of sherry?’ suggested his lordship helpfully.

‘A glass of sherry?’ suggested his lordship helpfully.

‘No, no—nothing, thanks. A shocking thing has occurred. We are left—’

‘Better and better. A shock is exactly what I feel to need. My _café au
==> lait_, Bunter—and you may turn the bath on. Now, sir—out with it. I am <==
fortified against anything.’

‘Robert Fentiman,’ announced Mr Murbles impressively, ‘has disappeared.’

He thumped his umbrella.

immediately to you. And I find you—’

Mr Murbles waved an expressive hand at Wimsey, who was just taking from

and milk jug and a small pile of correspondence.

‘So you do,’ said Wimsey. ‘A depraved sight, I am afraid. H’m! It looks
very much as though Robert had got wind of trouble and didn’t like to
face the music’

Mr Murbles agreed dubiously.

to the City of Light. Will you excuse me for a few moments, sir? The

‘Oh, lord! that _was_ a bloomer. D’you know, I never thought of that.
Oh, well, I suppose I couldn’t hope to carry it off with a confounded
bloodhound like you on the trail. But it was fun while it lasted. Even

columns of Olivers makes me shout with joy. It’s almost as good as
getting the half-million.’

‘That reminds me,’ said Wimsey. ‘The one thing I don’t know is how you
knew about the half-million. Did Lady Dormer tell you about her will? Or

At midnight the telephone bell rang.

He had just gone to bed, and cursed it.

Savoy. When they arrived, he handed the girl over to the cloak-room
attendant. ‘I am going up to change,’ he added, and, turning, had the
pleasure of seeing his sleuth arguing with the porter in the entrance
hall.

==> Bunter, previously summoned by telephone, was already in attendance with <==
his master’s dress clothes. Having changed, Wimsey passed through the
hall again. The sleuth was there, quietly waiting. Wimsey grinned at him
and offered him a drink.

‘I can’t help it, my lord,’ said the detective.

He turned into the nearest telephone-booth and gave the number of
Scotland Yard. Presently an official voice replied, of which Wimsey

happy. No, thanks, my child, I don’t want another twopenn’orth—I’m

The rest of the day Wimsey was obliged to pass in idleness, so far as
the Bellona Club affair was concerned. On the following morning he was

‘I say—that phone call you asked me to trace.’

‘Yes?’

‘Oh, rather!’

Wimsey considered a few moments on the doorstep, and then drove straight

Parker, a square-built man in the late thirties, with the nondescript
features which lend themselves so excellently to detective purposes, was
possibly Lord Peter’s most intimate—in some ways his only
intimate—friend. The two men had worked out many cases together and

possibly Lord Peter’s most intimate—in some ways his only

each respected the other’s qualities, though no two characters could
have been more widely different. Wimsey was the Roland of the
combination—quick, impulsive, careless, and an artistic

his mind a blank to art and literature, and exercising itself, in spare
moments, with Evangelical theology. He was the one person who was never
irritated by Wimsey’s mannerisms, and Wimsey repaid him with a genuine
affection foreign to his usually detached nature.

He put on the table, on the one hand the bundle of used cheques, and on
the other the sheet of paper he had taken from the library at the
Bellona Club.

‘That’s a very pretty set of fingerprints you’ve been pulling up there.
What is it? Forgery?’

‘No. Nothing of that sort. I just want to know whether the same bloke

What is it? Forgery?’

‘No. Nothing of that sort. I just want to know whether the same bloke
who wrote these cheques made the notes too.’

==> Parker rang a bell, and requested the attendance of Mr Collins. <==

‘Nice fat sums involved, from the looks of it,’ he went on, scanning the
sheet of notes appreciatively. ‘£150,000 to R., £300,000 to G.—lucky
G.—who’s G.? £20,000 here and £50,000 there. Who’s your rich friend,

‘That’s fine. That checks up the results of the fingerprint test too. I
don’t mind telling you, Charles,’ he added, when Collins had departed,
‘that this case is getting damned interesting.’

==> At this point the telephone rang, and Parker, after listening for some <==
time, ejaculated, ‘Good work!’ and then, turning to Wimsey:

‘That’s our man. They’ve got him. Excuse me if I rush off. Between you
and me, we’ve pulled this off rather well. It may mean rather a big
thing for me. Sure we can’t do anything else for you? Because I’ve got

He returned to the library, balancing the two letters in his hand.
‘There’s many a man now walking the streets of London,’ said he,
‘through not clearing trumps. Take these letters to the post, Bunter.

bottles of the Chambertin.’

sampling a vintage port. Mr Murbles, on the other hand, grew more and
more depressed as the story was unfolded.

‘And what do you think of it?’ inquired Wimsey.

him.

‘This Oliver appears to be a very elusive person,’ said he.

‘Isn’t he?’ agreed Wimsey dryly. ‘Almost as elusive as the famous Mrs

‘Oh, dear me!’ said Mr Murbles.

‘You forced Fentiman’s hand very ingeniously by sending him down with

‘Well, you see, I had a feeling that unless we did something pretty
definite, Oliver would keep vanishing and reappearing like the Cheshire
Cat, whenever our investigations seemed to be taking an awkward turn.’

Mr Murbles groaned.

==> ‘Look here,’ broke in Parker, ‘this is a very pretty theory, Peter, but, <==
allowing that the General died, as you say, on the evening of the 10th,
where was the body? As Mr Murbles says, it would have been a trifle

‘No, no,’ said Mr Murbles, seized with an idea. ‘Repellent as the whole

‘Fingerprints?’ suggested Mr Murbles eagerly.

‘Afraid that’s too much to hope for after all this time. What do you
say, Charles?’

==> ‘I say we shall find a long scratch on the paint,’ said Parker, ‘where <==
the foot of the corpse rested and stiffened in that position.’

‘Holed it in one, Charles. And that, you see, was when the leg had to be
bent with violence in order to drag the corpse out.’

the foot of the corpse rested and stiffened in that position.’

‘Holed it in one, Charles. And that, you see, was when the leg had to be
bent with violence in order to drag the corpse out.’

==> ‘And as the body was in a sitting position,’ pursued Parker, ‘we shall, <==
of course, find a seat inside the cabinet.’

‘Yes, and, with luck, we _may_ find a projecting nail or something which
caught the General’s trouser-leg when the body was removed.’

The man ceased struggling and glanced sharply up at him with a pair of
dark, beady eyes.

‘Do you think it wise, my lord, to use violence?’

==> ‘Who is it?’ asked Parker. <==

‘Pritchard’s clerk. He’s been hanging around George Fentiman for days.
Now he’s hanging round me. He’s probably the fellow that’s been hanging
round the Bellona. If you go on like this, my man, you’ll find yourself
hanging somewhere else one of these days. Now, see here. Do you want me

It was close on one o’clock when the three men emerged from the solemn
portals of the Bellona Club. Mr Murbles was very much subdued. Wimsey
==> and Parker displayed the sober elation of men whose calculations have <==
proved satisfactory. They had found the scratches. They had found the
nail in the seat of the chair. They had even found the carpet. Moreover,
they had found the origin of Oliver. Reconstructing the crime, they had
sat in the end bay of the library, as Robert Fentiman might have sat,
casting his eyes around him while he considered how he could best hide

the time, had yet suggested itself an hour or so later to Fentiman,
when, calling up from Charing Cross, he had been obliged to invent a
surname on the spur of the moment.

And, finally, placing the light, spare form of the unwilling Mr Murbles,
==> in the telephone cabinet, Parker had demonstrated that a fairly tall and <==
strong man could have extricated the body from the box, carried it into
the smoking-room and arranged it in the armchair by the fire, all in
something under four minutes.

Mr Murbles made one last effort on behalf of his client. ‘There were

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 32284    window = 32279 32289


blasphemous! Really, I cannot find words. This is the most disgraceful
thing I ever heard of. At the moment when all our thoughts should be
concentrated on the brave fellows who laid down their lives for us—to
be engaged in perpetrating a fraud—an irreverent crime—’

==> ‘Half a million is a good bit of money,’ said Parker thoughtfully. <==

‘Horrible!’ said Mr Murbles.

‘Meanwhile,’ said Wimsey, ‘what do you propose to do about it?’

soul! To think that I should be mixed up in a thing like this! He will
have to find another man of business in future. We shall have to explain
matters to Pritchard and apologise. I really hardly know how to tell him
such a thing.’

==> ‘I rather gather he suspects a good deal of it already,’ said Parker <==
mildly. ‘Else why should he have sent that clerk of his to spy on you
and George and Fentiman? I dare say he has been keeping tabs on Robert,
too.’

‘I shouldn’t wonder,’ said Wimsey. ‘He certainly treated me like a

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 32307    window = 32302 32312


‘I shouldn’t wonder,’ said Wimsey. ‘He certainly treated me like a
conspirator when I called on him. The only thing that puzzles me now is
why he should have suddenly offered to compromise.’

‘Probably Miss Dorland lost patience, or they despaired of proving
==> anything,’ said Parker. ‘While Robert stuck to that Oliver story, it <==
would be very hard to prove anything.’

‘Exactly,’ said Wimsey. ‘That is why I had to hang on so long, and press
Robert so hard about it. I might suspect Oliver to be non-existent, but
one can’t prove a negative.’

[line number in individual story] matching line = 4741    window = 4736 4746

all the evidence round there, and I’ll have the varnish on the cabinet
analysed and shown to correspond with the sample I took from the
General’s boots. Make it for two o’clock, and then we can all go round
and interview Pritchard afterwards.’

==> Parker supported this suggestion. Mr Murbles was so wrought up that he <==
would gladly have rushed away to confront Robert Fentiman immediately.
It being, however, pointed out to him that Fentiman was in Richmond,
that an alarm at this ungodly hour might drive him to do something
desperate, and also that all three investigators needed repose, the old
gentleman gave way and permitted himself to be taken home to Staple Inn.

hours had begun to grow into big hours and the early workmen were
abroad.

                          GRAND SLAM IN SPADES


On the seventh morning after the exhumation—which happened to be a
Tuesday—Lord Peter walked briskly into Mr Murbles’s chambers in Staple
==> Inn, with Detective-Inspector Parker at his heels. <==

‘Good morning,’ said Mr Murbles, surprised.

‘Good morning,’ said Wimsey. ‘Hark! hark! the lark at heaven’s gate
sings. He is coming, my own, my sweet, were it ever so airy a tread. He

remember now his saying that night he felt a bit sickish, but I never
thought—I say, Wimsey—you do believe, don’t you, that I hadn’t the
foggiest? I say—that awful female—I knew she was a wrong ‘un. But
poison! that is too thick. Good lord!’

==> Parker, who had hitherto preserved the detached expression of a friendly <==
spectator, now beamed. ‘Damn good, old man!’ he cried, and smote Peter
on the back. Professional enthusiasm overcame him. ‘It’s a real case,’
he said, ‘and you’ve handled it finely, Peter. I didn’t know you had it
in you to hang on so patiently. Forcing the exhumation on ’em through
putting pressure on Major Fentiman was simply masterly! Pretty work!

A hasty consultation with the powers that be at Scotland Yard put
==> Detective-Inspector Parker in charge of the Fentiman case, and he <==
promptly went into consultation with Wimsey.

‘What put you on to this poison business?’ he asked.

‘Aristotle, chiefly,’ replied Wimsey. ‘He says, you know, that one

wouldn’t have had the slightest motive. Still, we’ll put him in the
column headed Opportunity.’

‘That’s right, Charles. I do like your methodical ways.’

==> ‘Attraction of opposites,’ said Parker, ruling a notebook into three <==
columns. ‘Opportunity: No. 1, Dr Penberthy. If the tablets or globules
or whatever they were, were Penberthy’s own prescription, he would have
a specially good opportunity. Not so good, though, if they were the kind
of things you get ready-made from the chemist in sealed bottles.’

‘Very. And I remember his saying one rather unguarded thing at least
down at the Club on the very day the murder—or rather, the death—was
discovered.’

==> ‘That’s in his favour, if anything,’ said Parker cheerfully, ‘unless <==
he’s very reckless indeed.’

‘It won’t be in his favour with the police,’ grumbled Wimsey.

‘My dear man!’

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 33321    window = 33316 33326



‘You would be,’ said Wimsey. ‘Just a moment, Culyer.’ He drew the
secretary aside. ‘See here, I’m damned annoyed about this, but it can’t
be helped. You can’t stop these boys when they’re after a story. And,
anyway, it’s all got to come out. It’s a police affair now. This is
==> Detective-Inspector Parker of Scotland Yard.’ <==

‘But what’s the matter?’ demanded Culyer.

‘Murder’s the matter, I’m afraid.’

with it. And, Salcombe, if you’ll call off your tripe-hounds, we’ll let
you have an interview and a set of photographs.’

‘That’s the stuff,’ said Hardy.

==> ‘I’m sure,’ agreed Parker pleasantly, ‘that you lads don’t want to get <==
in the way, and I’ll tell you all that’s advisable. Show us a room,
Captain Culyer, and I’ll send out a statement and then you’ll let us get
to work.’

This was agreed and, a suitable paragraph having been provided by

Captain Culyer, and I’ll send out a statement and then you’ll let us get

This was agreed and, a suitable paragraph having been provided by
==> Parker, the Fleet Street gang departed, bearing Wimsey away with them <==
like a captured Sabine maiden, to drink in the nearest bar, in the hope
of acquiring picturesque details.

‘But I wish you’d kept out of it, Sally,’ mourned Peter.

his forehead, and wept.

                 *        *        *        *        *

==> Parker’s first and most obvious move was to interview Penberthy, whom he <==
caught at Harley Street after surgery hours.

‘Now I’m not going to worry you about that certificate, doctor,’ he
began pleasantly. ‘We’re all liable to make mistakes, and I understand
that a death resulting from an overdose of digitalin would look very

specific disease, like mumps or housemaid’s knee. It is this
incompatiblity of outlook between the medical and the lay mind which
involves counsel and medical witnesses in a fog of misunderstanding and
mutual irritation.

==> ‘Just so,’ said Parker. ‘Now, General Fentiman had got heart disease <==
already, hadn’t he? Is digitalin a thing one takes for heart disease?’

‘Yes; in certain forms of heart disease, digitalin is a very valuable
stimulant.’

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 33380    window = 33375 33385


‘Stimulant? I thought it was a depressant.’

‘It acts as a stimulant at first; in later stages it depresses the
heart’s action.’

==> ‘Oh, I see.’ Parker did not see very well, since, like most people, he <==
had a vague idea that each drug has one simple effect appropriate to it,
and is, specifically, a cure for something or the other. ‘It first
speeds up the heart and then slows it down.’

‘Not exactly. It strengthens the heart’s action by retarding the beat,

[line number in individual story] matching line = 5817    window = 5812 5822

difficulty in breathing suggested the urgent necessity of a cardiac
stimulant. I gave him a prescription containing a small quantity of
digitalin to relieve this condition. Here is the prescription. I will
write it out for you.’

==> ‘A small quantity?’ repeated Parker. <==

‘Quite small, combined with other drugs to counteract the depressing
after-effects.’

‘It was not as large as the dose afterwards found in the body?’

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 33459    window = 33454 33464


‘Just so.’

‘Well, I’m very much obliged to you, Dr Penberthy. I will just see your
dispenser and take copies of the entries in your books, if I may.’

==> This done, Parker made his way to Portman Square, still a little hazy in <==
his mind as to the habits of the common foxglove when applied
internally—a haziness which was in no way improved by a subsequent
consultation of the ‘Materia Medica’, ‘Pharmacopoeia’ Dixon Mann,
Taylor, Glaister, and others of those writers who had so kindly and
helpfully published their conclusions on toxicology.

==> ‘Now, Mrs Mitcham,’ said Inspector Parker affably. He was always saying <==
‘Now, Mrs Somebody’, and he always remembered to say it affably. It was
part of the routine.

The late Lady Dormer’s housekeeper bowed frigidly, to indicate that she
would submit to questioning.

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 34008    window = 34003 34013


‘I expect it would seem very pitiful to a young lady like Miss Dorland?’

‘No doubt; she is a young lady with feelings; not like some of those you
see nowadays.’

==> Parker wagged his head sympathetically. <==

‘And then?’

‘Then Miss Dorland went away again, after a little talk with me, and
presently Nellie came in—that’s the housemaid.’

‘Oh, some time. I had just finished my cup of tea which I have at four
o’clock. It would be about half-past. She came to ask for some brandy
for the General, as he was feeling badly. The spirits are kept in my
room, you see, and I have the key.’

==> Parker showed nothing of his special interest in this piece of news. <==

‘Did you see the General when you took the brandy?’

‘I did not take it.’ Mrs Mitcham’s tone implied that fetching and
carrying was not part of her duty. ‘I sent it by Nellie.’

[line number in individual story] matching line = 6456    window = 6451 6461

wants to know, but remember he is busy and don’t start your chattering.
You can speak to Nellie here, officer.’

And she sailed out.

==> ‘A bit stiff, isn’t she?’ murmured Parker in an awestruck whisper. <==

‘She’s one of the old-fashioned sort, I don’t mind saying,’ agreed
Nellie with a laugh.

‘She put the wind up me. Now, Nellie’—he took up the old formula—‘I

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 34109    window = 34104 34114


and he put General Fentiman into it, and then Miss Dorland and nurse
went upstairs again, and that was the end of it.’

‘I see. How long have you been here, Nellie?’

==> ‘Three years—sir.’ The ‘sir’ was a concession to Parker’s nice manners <==
and educated way of speech. ‘Quite the gentleman,’ as Nellie remarked
afterwards to Mrs Mitcham, who replied, ‘No, Nellie—gentlemanlike I
will not deny, but a policeman is a person, and I will trouble you to
remember it.’

‘And Miss Dorland?’

‘Oh, she gives no trouble, except clearing up after her. But she always
speaks nicely and says please and thank you. I haven’t any complaints.’

==> ‘Modified rapture,’ thought Parker. Apparently Ann Dorland had not the <==
knack of inspiring passionate devotion. ‘Not a very lively house is it,
for a young girl like yourself?’

‘Dull as ditchwater,’ agreed Nellie frankly. ‘Miss Dorland would have
what they called studio parties sometimes, but not at all smart and

the hall at the time, you see, and she was speaking that quick and loud
I couldn’t help hearing. “I’ll fight it for all I’m worth,” that was
what she said, and “a . . . something—to defraud.” What would that be,
now?’

==> ‘Plot?’ suggested Parker. <==

‘No—a—a conspiracy, that’s it. A conspiracy to defraud. And then I
didn’t hear any more till Mr Pritchard came out, and he said to her,
“Very well, Miss Dorland, we will make an independent inquiry.” And Miss
Dorland looked so eager and angry, I was surprised. But it all seemed to

‘Well, I think it was when all this dreadful business came out about the
poor old gentleman being murdered. It is awful, sir, isn’t it? Do you
think you’ll catch the one as did it?’

==> ‘Oh, I expect so,’ said Parker cheerfully. ‘That came as a shock to Miss <==
Dorland, did it?’

‘Well, I should say so. There was a little bit in the paper, you know,
sir, about Sir James Lubbock having found out about the poisoning, and
when I called Miss Dorland in the morning I took leave to point it out.

I said, “That’s a funny thing, miss, isn’t it, about General Fentiman
being poisoned?”—just like that, I said. And she said, “Poisoned,
Nellie? You must be mistaken.” So I showed her the bit in the paper and
she looked just dreadful.’

==> ‘Well, well,’ said Parker, ‘it’s a very horrid thing to hear about a <==
person one knows. Anybody would be upset.’

‘Yes, sir; me and Mrs Mitcham was quite overcome. “Poor old gentleman!”
I said; “whatever should anybody want to do him in for? He must have
gone off his head and made away with himself,” I said. Do you think that

was it, sir?’

==> ‘It’s quite possible, of course,’ said Parker genially. <==

‘Cut up about his sister dying like that, don’t you think. That’s what I
said to Mrs Mitcham. But she said a gentleman like General Fentiman
wouldn’t make away with himself and leave his affairs in confusion like
he did. So I said, “Was his affairs in confusion, then?” and she said,

wouldn’t make away with himself and leave his affairs in confusion like
he did. So I said, “Was his affairs in confusion, then?” and she said,
“They’re not your affairs, Nellie, so you needn’t be discussing them.”
What do you think yourself, sir?’

==> ‘I don’t think anything yet,’ said Parker; ‘but you have been very <==
helpful. Now, would you kindly run and ask Miss Dorland if she could
spare me a few minutes?’

Ann Dorland received him in the back drawing-room. He thought what an
unattractive girl she was, with her sullen manner and gracelessness of

Ann Dorland received him in the back drawing-room. He thought what an

form and movement. She sat huddled on one end of the sofa, in a black
dress which made the worst of her sallow, blotched complexion. She had

curtly, in a voice roughened and hoarse and curiously lifeless.

‘I am sorry to trouble you again,’ said Parker politely.

“You can’t help yourself, I suppose.’ She avoided his eye, and lit a

certainly been crying, Parker thought, and when she spoke to him it was
curtly, in a voice roughened and hoarse and curiously lifeless.

==> ‘I am sorry to trouble you again,’ said Parker politely. <==

“You can’t help yourself, I suppose.’ She avoided his eye, and lit a
fresh cigarette from the stump of the last.

‘I just want to have any details you can give me about General

‘Quite so. Did she stay there throughout the interview?’

‘I haven’t the least idea.’

==> ‘Well,’ said Parker patiently, ‘you can tell me this. When you went in <==
with the brandy, the nurse was in the bedroom then?’

‘Yes, she was.’

‘Now, about the brandy. Nellie brought that up to you in the studio, she

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 34285    window = 34280 34290


This roused the girl a little.

‘Decent servants don’t knock at doors,’ she said, with a contemptuous
rudeness. ‘She came in, of course.’

==> ‘I beg your pardon,’ retorted Parker, stung. ‘I thought she might have <==
knocked at the door of your private room.’

‘No.’

‘What did she say to you?’

[line number in individual story] matching line = 6705    window = 6700 6710

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 34295    window = 34290 34300


‘What did she say to you?’

‘Can’t you ask _her_ all these questions?’

‘I have done so. But servants are not always accurate; I should like
==> your corroboration.’ Parker had himself in hand again now, and spoke <==
pleasantly.

‘She said that Nurse Armstrong had sent her for some brandy, because
General Fentiman was feeling faint, and told her to call me. So I said
she had better go and telephone Dr Penberthy while I took the brandy.’

‘Taking it straight out of Nellie’s hands? Or did she put it down on the
table or anywhere?’

‘How the hell should I remember?’

==> Parker disliked a swearing woman, but he tried hard not to let this <==
prejudice him.

‘You can’t remember—at any rate, you know you went straight on up with
it? You didn’t wait to do anything else?’


[line number in individual story] matching line = 6756    window = 6751 6761

Her anxiety to shelve the subject of chemistry seemed to be conquering
her reluctance to get on with the story.

‘You were making chemical experiments—although Lady Dormer was so ill?’
==> said Parker severely. <==

‘It was just to occupy my mind,’ she muttered.

‘What was the experiment?’

Armstrong said he seemed really better, and it would be a mistake to
worry him into doing what he didn’t want. So I told Nellie to warn the
doctor and send William for a taxi. General Fentiman seemed stronger
then, so we helped him downstairs and he went off in the taxi.’

==> Out of this spate of words Parker fixed on the one thing he had not <==
heard before.

‘What drops were those the nurse gave him?’

‘His own. He had them in his pocket.’

[line number in individual story] matching line = 6808    window = 6803 6813

studio.’

‘What for?’

‘It’s just a matter of routine. We are under orders to see everything
==> there is to see,’ replied Parker reassuringly. <==

They went upstairs. A door on the first-floor landing immediately
opposite the head of the staircase led into a pleasant, lofty room, with
old-fashioned bedroom furniture in it.

‘Quite. Where does that second door lead to?’

‘That’s the dressing-room. Nurse Armstrong slept there while Auntie was
ill.’

==> Parker glanced into the dressing-room, took in the arrangement of the <==
bedroom and expressed himself satisfied.

She walked past him without acknowledgement while he held the door open.
She was a sturdily-built girl, but moved with a languor distressing to

‘You want to see the studio?’

‘Please.’

She led the way down the six steps and along a short passage to the room
==> which, as Parker already knew, was built out the back over the kitchen <==
premises. He mentally calculated the distance as he went.

The studio was large and well-lit by its glass roof. One end was
furnished like a sitting-room; the other was left bare, and devoted to
what Nellie called ‘mess’. A very ugly picture (in Parker’s opinion)

The studio was large and well-lit by its glass roof. One end was
furnished like a sitting-room; the other was left bare, and devoted to
==> what Nellie called ‘mess’. A very ugly picture (in Parker’s opinion) <==
stood on an easel. Other canvases were stacked round the walls. In one
corner was a table covered with American cloth, on which stood a gas
ring, protected by a tin plate, and a Bunsen burner.

‘I’ll look up that address,’ said Miss Dorland indifferently; ‘I’ve got

ring, protected by a tin plate, and a Bunsen burner.

‘I’ll look up that address,’ said Miss Dorland indifferently; ‘I’ve got
it here somewhere.’

==> She began to rummage in an untidy desk. Parker strolled up to the <==
business end of the room and explored it with eyes, nose and fingers.

The ugly picture on the easel was newly painted; the smell told him
that, and the dabs of paint on the palette were still soft and sticky.
Work had been done there within the last two days, he was sure. The

that, and the dabs of paint on the palette were still soft and sticky.
Work had been done there within the last two days, he was sure. The
brushes had been stuck at random into a small pot of turpentine. He
lifted them out; they were still clogged with paint. The picture itself
was a landscape, he thought, roughly drawn and hot and restless in
==> colour. Parker was no judge of art; he would have liked to get Wimsey’s <==
opinion. He explored further. The table with the Bunsen burner was bare,
but in a cupboard close by he discovered a quantity of chemical
apparatus of the kind he remembered using at school. Everything had been
tidily washed and stacked away. Nellie’s job, he imagined. There were a
number of simple and familiar chemical substances in jars and packages

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 34467    window = 34462 34472



‘That’s all nothing,’ she said. ‘I don’t do any of that muck now. It was
just a passing craze. I paint, really. What do you think of this?’ She
indicated the unpleasant landscape.

==> Parker said it was very good. <==

‘Aren’t these your work, too?’ he asked, indicating the other canvases.

‘Yes,’ she said.

He turned a few of them to the light, noticing at the same time how
dusty they were. Nellie had scamped this bit of the work—or perhaps had
been told not to touch. Miss Dorland showed a trifle more animation than
she had done hitherto while displaying her works. Landscape seemed to be
rather a new departure; most of the canvases were figure studies. Mr
==> Parker thought that, on the whole, the artist had done wisely to turn to <==
landscape. He was not well acquainted with the modern school of thought
in painting, and had difficulty in expressing his opinion of these
curious figures, with their faces like eggs and their limbs like rubber.

‘That is the “Judgement of Paris”,’ said Miss Dorland.

‘Oh, just a study of a woman dressing. It’s not very good. I think this
portrait of Mrs Mitcham is rather decent, though.’

Parker stared aghast; it might possibly be a symbolic representation of

portrait of Mrs Mitcham is rather decent, though.’

==> Parker stared aghast; it might possibly be a symbolic representation of <==
Mrs Mitcham’s character, for it was very hard and spiky; but it looked
more like a Dutch doll, with its triangular nose, like a sharp-edged
block of wood, and its eyes mere dots in an expanse of liver-coloured
cheek.

‘It’s not very like her,’ he said doubtfully.

‘It’s not meant to be.’

the next picture up hurriedly.

‘Oh, that’s nothing—just a fancy head.’

Evidently this picture—the head of a rather cadaverous man, with a

‘Oh, that’s nothing—just a fancy head.’

Evidently this picture—the head of a rather cadaverous man, with a
sinister smile and a slight cast in the eye—was despised, a Philistine

tried to concentrate his attention on a ‘Madonna and Child’ which, to
Parker’s simple evangelical mind, seemed an abominable blasphemy.

Happily, Miss Dorland soon wearied, even of her paintings, and flung
them all back into the corner.

address.’

‘Just one more question,’ he said, looking her hard in the eyes. ‘Before
Lady Dormer died—before General Fentiman came to see her—did you know
what provision she had made for him in her will?’

The girl stared back at him, and he saw panic come into her eyes. It
seemed to flow all over her like a wave. She clenched her hands at her
sides, and her miserable eyes dropped beneath his gaze, shifting as
though looking for a way out.

==> ‘Well?’ said Parker. <==

“No!’ she said. ‘No! of course not. Why should I?’ Then, surprisingly, a
dull crimson flush flooded her sallow cheeks and ebbed away, leaving her
looking like death.

it’s the time factor that’s worrying me, you know. Supposing she gave
the old boy digitalin in his B. and S., why should it wait all that time
before working? According to the books, it ought to have pooped off in
about an hour’s time. It was a biggish dose, according to Lubbock.’

‘I know. I think you’re up against a snag there. That’s why I should
have liked to see the pictures.’

gave it up.

‘George Fentiman—’ he began.

‘Yes,’ said Wimsey, ‘George Fentiman. I must be getting emotional in my

question of George Fentiman’s opportunities.’

‘Yes—by the way, we have only Robert’s unsupported word for what
happened in that last interview between him and the old man.’

from General Fentiman at about half-past six, and Robert found Fentiman
dead at about eight o’clock. So, allowing that the stuff was given in a
pill—’

==> ‘Which it would have to be, in a taxi,’ interjected Parker. <==

‘As you say—in a pill, which would take a bit longer to get working
than the same stuff taken in solution—why, then the General might quite
well have been able to get to the Bellona and see Robert before
collapsing.’

‘I suppose it hadn’t struck him in that light.’

‘Then George is a bigger ass than I took him for.’

==> ‘Possibly he is,’ said Parker dryly. ‘At any rate, I have put a man on <==
to make inquiries at his home.’

‘Oh, have you? I say, do you know, I wish I’d left this case alone. What
the deuce did it matter if old Fentiman was pushed painlessly off a bit
before his time? He was simply indecently ancient.’

‘Not he. Disappeared completely. We shall find the car, of course—it’s

Then, at 10 o’clock, the news came through that the missing
Walmisley-Hubbard had turned up. It had been abandoned in a remote

has left the paints on the palette, and the brushes are still stuck in
the turps, turning their ends up and generally ruining themselves.

he had mentioned to Wimsey before.

‘Put that up on the easel. That’s very interesting. The others, you see,
are all an effort to imitate other people’s art, but this—this is an

‘He’s not beautiful. But I think the sinister squint is chiefly due to
bad drawing. It’s very difficult to get eyes looking the same way, when
you can’t draw. Cover up one eye, Charles—not yours, the portrait’s.’

Wimsey looked again, and shook his head.

‘It escapes me for the moment,’ he said. ‘Probably it’s nobody I know

Wimsey looked again, and shook his head.

‘It escapes me for the moment,’ he said. ‘Probably it’s nobody I know
after all. But, whoever it is, surely this room tells you something.’

==> ‘It suggests to me,’ said Parker, ‘that the girl’s been taking more <==
interest in crimes and chemistry stuff than is altogether healthy in the
circumstances.’

Wimsey looked at him for a moment.

Wimsey looked at him for a moment.

‘I wish I could think as you do.’

==> ‘What _do_ you think?’ demanded Parker impatiently. <==

‘No,’ said Wimsey. ‘I told you about that George business this morning,
because glass bottles are facts, and one mustn’t conceal facts. But I’m
not obliged to tell you what I think.’

‘I don’t know about that, Charles. I came here hoping that this room
could tell me the same thing that it told you. But it hasn’t. It’s told
me different. It’s told me what I thought all along.’

==> ‘A penny for your thoughts, then,’ said Parker, trying desperately to <==
keep the conversation on a jocular footing.

‘Not even thirty pieces of silver,’ replied Wimsey mournfully.

Parker stacked the canvases away without another word.

Nurse Armstrong belonged to an expensive nursing-home in Great Wimpole
Street. She had not been interviewed before, having only returned the
previous evening from escorting an invalid lady to Italy. She was a
large, good-looking, imperturbable woman, rather like the Venus of Milo,
==> and she answered Parker’s questions in a cheerful, matter-of-fact tone, <==
as though they had been about bandages or temperatures.

‘Oh, yes, constable; I remember the poor old gentleman being brought in,
perfectly.’

‘No—she stopped to call Miss Dorland on the way. Of course, she ought

afterwards—but it’s anything to save trouble with these girls, as I
dare say you know.’

==> ‘Did Miss Dorland bring it straight up—’ began Parker. Nurse Armstrong <==
broke in upon him.

‘If you’re thinking, did she put the digitalin into the brandy, you can
dismiss that from your mind, constable. If he’d had as big a dose as
that in solution at half-past four, he’d have been taken ill ever so

‘She was never alone with him?’

‘Not for a moment.’

‘Did you like Miss Dorland, nurse? Is she a nice girl, I mean?’ Wimsey

‘She was always very pleasant to me,’ said Nurse Armstrong. ‘I shouldn’t
call her an attractive girl, not to my mind.’

‘She was always very pleasant to me,’ said Nurse Armstrong. ‘I shouldn’t

‘Did she ever mention Lady Dormer’s testamentary arrangements in your

‘Well—not exactly. But I remember her once talking about her painting,

thousand pounds, which, carefully invested, might mean six or seven
hundred a year. She didn’t say she expected to be very rich?’

‘No.’

Armstrong, with a faint giggle, ‘that’s what they call it in novels.’

‘How long did you stay on at the house after Lady Dormer died?’ pursued
Wimsey.

‘I waited on till after the funeral, just in case Miss Dorland should

‘Not staying in the house. She went out to see some friends one evening.
I think—the evening before I left. She didn’t say who they were.’

‘I see. Thank you, nurse.’

==> Parker had no more questions to put, and they took their leave. <==

‘Well,’ said Parker, ‘how anybody could admire that girl’s voice—’

‘You noticed that! My theory is coming out right, Charles. I wish it

to wash out the idea that General Fentiman got his dose in Portman
Square. By the way, didn’t you say you’d met the Dorland girl at the
Rushworth’s?’

Falstaff.

‘And how’s it all going?’ demanded Sally, ordering boiled beef and
carrots.

==> He looked limpidly at Parker, who shook his head. <==

‘Discreet man, your friend,’ said Sally to Peter. ‘I suppose the police
are engaged in following up a clue—or have we reached the point when
they are completely baffled? Or do we say that an arrest is imminent,
eh?’

‘Tell us your own version, Sally. Your opinion’s as good as anybody’s.’

‘Oh, mine! Same as yours—same as everybody’s. The girl was in league
with the doctor, of course. Pretty obvious, isn’t it?’

==> ‘Maybe,’ said Parker cautiously. ‘But that’s a hard thing to prove. We <==
know, of course, that they both sometimes went to Mrs Rushworth’s house,
but there’s no evidence that they knew each other well.’

‘But, you ass, she—’ Wimsey blurted out. He shut his mouth again with a
snap. ‘No, I won’t. Fish it out for yourselves.’

The relief in his mind would have been overwhelming, had it not been for
that nagging central uncertainty. It was the portrait that worried him
most. Painted as a record, painted to recall beloved features—thrust
face to the wall and covered with dust.

‘. . . moral certainty is not the same thing as proof.’

‘Unless we can show that she knew the terms of the will . . .’

‘I didn’t know that,’ said Hardy. He was annoyed. All kinds of ‘stories’
were coming his way today, and tomorrow there would probably be an
arrest, and he wouldn’t be able to use them.

that?’

‘After I told Penberthy there was going to be an exhumation,’ said
Wimsey, as though in spite of himself.

Wimsey, as though in spite of himself.

‘There you are! They saw it was getting too dangerous.’

‘Do you remember how nervous Penberthy was at the exhumation?’ said
==> Parker. ‘That man—what’s his name?—his joke about Palmer, and knocking <==
over the jar?’

‘What was that?’ demanded Hardy again. Parker told him, and he listened,
grinding his teeth. Another good story gone west. But it would all come
out at the trial, and would be worth a headline.

‘Why not?’

‘Well, that brings us back to the old question: why the delay?’

recognised by everybody that nobody would connect it with the General’s
death.’

‘Of course,’ said Wimsey. He felt that matters were rushing past him at

‘How soon do you think you’ll be able to take action?’ asked Hardy. ‘I
suppose you’ll want a bit more solid proof before you actually arrest
him?’

==> ‘I’d have to be certain that they don’t wriggle out of it,’ said Parker <==
slowly. ‘It’s not enough to prove that they were acquainted. There may
be letters, of course, when we go over the girl’s things. Or
Penberthy’s—though he’s hardly the man to leave compromising documents
lying about.’

‘Of course there hasn’t,’ said Wimsey. ‘They’ve quarrelled.’

‘Oh, well—it doesn’t matter—I _think_ so, that’s all. And anyway, they
would take jolly good care not to communicate, once the alarm was

‘Interviewing the Rushworth’s,’ said Waffles, edging his way into a
chair by Hardy. He was a thin, sandy person, with a tired manner. Hardy

‘Got your story in?’

‘Oh, yes. Awful lot of cats these women are. Ma Rushworth—she’s the
sloppy sort of woman with her head in the clouds all the time, who never

‘Besides, they aren’t such fools as not to know that Penberthy’s
connection with the Dorland girl must be smothered up at all costs. They
know she did it, all right, but they aren’t going to compromise him.’

==> ‘Of course not,’ said Parker, rather shortly. ‘The mother probably knows <==
nothing, anyway. It’s a different matter if we get the girl in the
witness-box—’

‘You won’t,’ said Waffles Newton. ‘At least, you’ll have to be jolly

‘That’s all right, old man.’

I’d better poop off. So long—and thanks very much for the tip, old
man.’

Wimsey followed him into the street.

Wimsey followed him into the street.

‘We’ll have to put the stopper on this marriage business, quick,’ said

be the devil and all if the Rushworth girl gets hitched up to Penberthy

go on with it, we can’t stop it without arresting Penberthy. Very

old man, what is it?’

‘Doesn’t fit the portrait. Or the books. Or the way Nurse Armstrong

far more than most explanations are. You’ve got that portrait on the
brain. It’s because you’re artistic, I suppose.’

For some reason, the word ‘artistic’ produces the most alarming
reactions in people who know anything about art.

ordinary human beings—’

coldly, ‘provided you don’t keep me here _all_ day.’ He slammed the taxi
door.

‘What a beast of a case this is,’ thought Wimsey. ‘That makes two silly,

hour. What address? Oh, yes, righty-ho! Sorry you’re missing your
dinner.’

==> ‘It’s all in the day’s work,’ growled Parker, and took his leave. <==

                 *        *        *        *        *

George Fentiman greeted them with a tired, white smile.

So I ran in here and told them all about it while he snored.’

The police superintendent tapped his forehead significantly behind
Sheila’s back.

==> ‘Has he made any statement?’ asked Parker. <==

‘Yes; he insisted on writing it himself. Here it is. Of course . . .’
The Superintendent shrugged his shoulders.

‘That’s all right,’ said George. ‘I’m getting sleepy myself. I’ve been

watching him for a day and a night, you know. I’m going to bed.
Sheila—it’s time to go to bed.’

‘Yes, dear.’

==> ‘We’ll have to keep him here tonight, I suppose,’ muttered Parker. ‘Has <==
the doctor seen him?’

‘We’ve sent for him, sir.’

‘Well, Mrs Fentiman, I think if you’d take your husband into the room

for?’

‘Dr Penberthy has vetted him from time to time, I think,’ put in Wimsey
suddenly. ‘Why not send for him?’

==> Parker gasped involuntarily. <==

‘He might be able to throw some light on the symptoms,’ said Wimsey in a
rigid voice.

Parker nodded.

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 36921    window = 36916 36926


Parker gasped involuntarily.

‘He might be able to throw some light on the symptoms,’ said Wimsey in a
rigid voice.

==> Parker nodded. <==

‘A good idea,’ he agreed. He moved to the telephone.

George smiled as his wife put her arm about his shoulder.

‘Tired,’ he said, ‘very tired. Off to bed, old girl.’

A police constable opened the door to them, and they started through it
together; George leaned heavily on Sheila; his feet dragged.

==> ‘Let’s have a look at his statement,’ said Parker. <==

It was written in a staggering handwriting, much blotted and erased,
with words left out and repeated here and there:

    ‘I am making this statement quickly while he is asleep, because

[line number in individual story] matching line = 9364    window = 9359 9369

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 36954    window = 36949 36959


    you will be able to bind him in chains and cast him into the pit
    and then I shall be able to sleep.

                                                  ‘GEORGE FENTIMAN.’

==> ‘Off his head, poor devil,’ said Parker. ‘We can’t pay much attention to <==
this. What did he say to you, Superintendent?’

‘He just came in, sir, and said, “I’m George Fentiman and I’ve come to
tell you about how I killed my grandfather.” So I questioned him, and he
rambled a good bit and then he asked for a pen and paper to make his

tell you about how I killed my grandfather.” So I questioned him, and he
rambled a good bit and then he asked for a pen and paper to make his
statement. I thought he ought to be detained, and I rang up the Yard,
sir.’

==> ‘Quite right,’ said Parker. <==

The door opened and Sheila came out.

‘He’s fallen asleep,’ she said. ‘It’s the old trouble come back again.
He thinks he’s the devil, you know. He’s been like that twice before,’

‘Nervous shock with well-marked delusions,’ said the police surgeon
briefly. ‘Probably be all right tomorrow. Sleeping it off now. Been this
way before, I understand. Just so. A hundred years ago they’d have
called it diabolic possession, but _we_ know better.’

==> ‘Yes,’ said Parker; ‘but do you think he is under a delusion in saying <==
he murdered his grandfather? Or did he actually murder him under the
influence of this diabolical delusion? That’s the point.’

‘Can’t say just at present. Might be the one—might be the other. Much
better wait till the attack passes off. You’ll be able to find out

opinion too, I believe?’ he added, turning to Penberthy.

‘Yes; that is my opinion.’

‘And what do you think about this delusion, Dr Penberthy?’ went on
==> Parker. ‘Did he do this insane act?’ <==

‘He certainly thinks he did it,’ said Penberthy. ‘I couldn’t possibly
say for certain whether he has any foundation for the belief. From time
to time he undoubtedly gets these fits of thinking that the devil has
taken hold of him, and of course it’s hard to say what a man might or

to time he undoubtedly gets these fits of thinking that the devil has
taken hold of him, and of course it’s hard to say what a man might or
might not do under the influence of such a delusion.’

He avoided Robert’s distressed eyes, and addressed himself exclusively
==> to Parker. <==

‘It seems to me,’ said Wimsey, ‘if you’ll excuse my pushin’ my opinion
forward and all that—it seems to me that’s a question of fact that can
be settled without reference to Fentiman and his delusions. There’s only
the one occasion on which the pill could have been administered—would

his dry lips before speaking.

‘I can’t answer that off-hand,’ he said.

‘The pill might have been introduced into General Fentiman’s stock of
==> pills at some other time,’ suggested Parker. <==

‘So it might,’ agreed Penberthy.

‘Had it the same shape and appearance as his ordinary pills?’ demanded
Wimsey, again fixing his eyes on Penberthy.

can do much more tonight. I have written out a prescription for the
patient, with Dr Penberthy’s entire agreement.’ He bowed; Penberthy
bowed. ‘I will have it made up, and you will no doubt see that it is
given to him. I shall be here in the morning.’

==> He looked interrogatively at Parker, who nodded. <==

‘Thank you, doctor; we will ask you for a further report tomorrow
morning. You’ll see that Mrs Fentiman is properly looked after,
Superintendent. If you wish to stay here and look after your brother and
Mrs Fentiman, Major, of course you may, and the Superintendent will make

Wimsey pushed his way out into the entrance-hall. There, as he had
expected, he found the plainclothes detective who had been told off to
shadow Penberthy.

==> ‘Send for Inspector Parker,’ he said. ‘I have a paper to give him. Your <==
job’s over; it’s the end of the case.’
