                               CHAPTER I


==> “Oh, damn!” said Lord Peter Wimsey at Piccadilly Circus. “Hi, driver!” <==

The taxi man, irritated at receiving this appeal while negotiating the
intricacies of turning into Lower Regent Street across the route of a 19
'bus, a 38-b and a bicycle, bent an unwilling ear.

“Sugg's a beautiful, braying ass,” said Lord Peter. “He's like a
detective in a novel. Well, I don't know anything about Levy, but I've
seen the body, and I should say the idea was preposterous upon the face
of it. What do you think of the brandy?”

==> “Unbelievable, Wimsey—sort of thing makes one believe in heaven. But I <==
want your yarn.”

“D'you mind if Bunter hears it, too? Invaluable man, Bunter—amazin'
fellow with a camera. And the odd thing is, he's always on the spot when
I want my bath or my boots. I don't know when he develops things—I

again 'mid nodings on' in the middle of the night.”

“He may have been disguised.”

“I thought of that—in fact, it seems the only possible explanation. But
==> it's deuced odd, Wimsey. An important city man, on the eve of an <==
important transaction, without a word of warning to anybody, slips off
in the middle of the night, disguised down to his skin, leaving behind
his watch, purse, cheque-book, and—most mysterious and important of
all—his spectacles, without which he can't see a step, as he is
extremely short-sighted. He——”

his watch, purse, cheque-book, and—most mysterious and important of
all—his spectacles, without which he can't see a step, as he is
extremely short-sighted. He——”

==> “That _is_ important,” interrupted Wimsey. “You are sure he didn't take <==
a second pair?”

“His man vouches for it that he had only two pairs, one of which was
found on his dressing-table, and the other in the drawer where it is
always kept.”

“Biggs' man was guilty all the same,” said Parker.

“Of course he was. But he was acquitted all the same, an' what you've
==> just said is libel,” Wimsey walked over to the bookshelf and took down a <==
volume of Medical Jurisprudence. “'_Rigor mortis_—can only be stated in
a very general way—many factors determine the result.' Cautious brute.
'On the average, however, stiffening will have begun—neck and jaw—5 to
6 hours after death'—m'm—'in all likelihood have passed off in the
bulk of cases by the end of 36 hours. Under certain circumstances,

“It rained hard all last night, of course.”

“Yes; did you notice that the soot on the window-sill was vaguely
marked?”

==> “I did,” said Wimsey, “and I examined it hard with this little fellow, <==
but I could make nothing of it except that something or other had rested
on the sill.” He drew out his monocle and handed it to Parker.

“My word, that's a powerful lens.”

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 881    window = 876 886


but I could make nothing of it except that something or other had rested
on the sill.” He drew out his monocle and handed it to Parker.

“My word, that's a powerful lens.”

==> “It is,” said Wimsey, “and jolly useful when you want to take a good <==
squint at somethin' and look like a bally fool all the time. Only it
don't do to wear it permanently—if people see you full-face they say:
'Dear me! how weak the sight of that eye must be!' Still, it's useful.”

“Sugg and I explored the ground at the back of the building,” went on

top of the window. I measured it with my stick—the gentleman-scout's
vade-mecum, I call it—it's marked off in inches. Uncommonly handy
companion at times. There's a sword inside and a compass in the head.
Got it made specially. Anything more?”

==> “Afraid not. Let's hear your version, Wimsey.” <==

“Well, I think you've got most of the points. There are just one or two
little contradictions. For instance, here's a man wears expensive
gold-rimmed pince-nez and has had them long enough to be mended twice.
Yet his teeth are not merely discoloured, but badly decayed and look as

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 919    window = 914 924


a sore place on the tongue. Nothing's more painful. D'you mean to tell
me a man would put up with that if he could afford to get the tooth
filed?”

“Well, people are queer. I've known servants endure agonies rather than
==> step over a dentist's door-mat. How did you see that, Wimsey?” <==

“Had a look inside; electric torch,” said Lord Peter. “Handy little
gadget. Looks like a matchbox. Well—I daresay it's all right, but I
just draw your attention to it. Second point: Gentleman with hair
smellin' of Parma violet and manicured hands and all the rest of it,

gadget. Looks like a matchbox. Well—I daresay it's all right, but I
just draw your attention to it. Second point: Gentleman with hair
smellin' of Parma violet and manicured hands and all the rest of it,
never washes inside his ears. Full of wax. Nasty.”

==> “You've got me there, Wimsey; I never noticed it. Still—old bad habits <==
die hard.”

“Right oh! Put it down at that. Third point: Gentleman with the manicure
and the brilliantine and all the rest of it suffers from fleas.”

quite a number of little short hairs stuck on his neck and the sides of
the bath—and he has shaved so recently that there is a line of dried
soap on his cheek—”

==> “Wimsey!” <==

“Wait a minute—and _dried soap in his mouth_.”

Bunter got up and appeared suddenly at the detective's elbow, the
respectful man-servant all over.

Bunter got up and appeared suddenly at the detective's elbow, the
respectful man-servant all over.

“A little more brandy, sir?” he murmured.

==> “Wimsey,” said Parker, “you are making me feel cold all over.” He <==
emptied his glass—stared at it as though he were surprised to find it
empty, set it down, got up, walked across to the bookcase, turned round,
stood with his back against it and said:

“Look here, Wimsey—you've been reading detective stories, you're

“Wimsey,” said Parker, “you are making me feel cold all over.” He
emptied his glass—stared at it as though he were surprised to find it
empty, set it down, got up, walked across to the bookcase, turned round,
stood with his back against it and said:

==> “Look here, Wimsey—you've been reading detective stories, you're <==
talking nonsense.”

“No, I ain't,” said Lord Peter, sleepily, “uncommon good incident for a
detective story, though, what? Bunter, we'll write one, and you shall
illustrate it with photographs.”

Parker turned them over once or twice in his fingers, looked at them
close to the light, examined them with a lens, handed them to the
impassible Bunter, and said:

==> “Do you mean to tell me, Wimsey, that any man alive would”—he laughed <==
harshly—“shave off his beard with his mouth open, and then go and get
killed with his mouth full of hairs? You're mad.”

“I don't tell you so,” said Wimsey. “You policemen are all alike—only
one idea in your skulls. Blest if I can make out why you're ever

“Do you mean to tell me, Wimsey, that any man alive would”—he laughed
harshly—“shave off his beard with his mouth open, and then go and get

appointed. He was shaved after he was dead. Pretty, ain't it? Uncommonly
jolly little job for the barber, what? Here, sit down, man, and don't be
an ass, stumpin' about the room like that. Worse things happen in war.
This is only a blinkin' old shillin' shocker. But I'll tell you what,

wealth and refinement, since he had all the apparatus of an elegant
toilet handy, and a man of bizarre, and almost perverted imagination, as
is shown in the two horrible touches of putting the body in the bath and
of adorning it with a pair of pince-nez.”

==> “He is a poet of crime,” said Wimsey. “By the way, your difficulty about <==
the pince-nez is cleared up. Obviously, the pince-nez never belonged to
the body.”

“That only makes a fresh puzzle. One can't suppose the murderer left
them in that obliging manner as a clue to his own identity.”

“By Jove!” he announced, beaming, “sportin' old bird! It's old Mrs.
Thipps. Deaf as a post. Never used the 'phone before. But determined.
Perfect Napoleon. The incomparable Sugg has made a discovery and

gentleman. Oh, Parker, Parker! I could kiss her, I reely could, as
Thipps says. I'll write to her instead—no, hang it, Parker, we'll go

They stepped out, Bunter carefully switching off the lights behind them.

                 *        *        *        *        *

==> As they emerged into the gloom and gleam of Piccadilly, Wimsey stopped <==
short with a little exclamation.

“Wait a second,” he said, “I've thought of something. If Sugg's there
he'll make trouble. I must short-circuit him.”

The constable came back:

“It's from the Yard, sir,” he said, coughing apologetically, “the Chief

stood apart non-committally, glazing his eyes.

“Five aces,” said Lord Peter, cheerfully. “The Chief's a dear friend of
my mother's. No go, Sugg, it's no good buckin' you've got a full house.
I'm goin' to make it a bit fuller.”

they are, it is very unfortunate for them, but I must say that the
circumstances seem to me most suspicious, and to Theophilus too, and I
should not like to have it said that we had assisted murderers. We might
even be supposed to be accessories. Of course you are young, Mr.——”

==> “This is Lord Peter Wimsey, my dear,” said Theophilus mildly. <==

She was unimpressed.

“Ah, yes,” she said, “I believe you are distantly related to my late
cousin, the Bishop of Carisbrooke. Poor man! He was always being taken

                  That on my birth have smiled,”

said Lord Peter, “and taught me to be bestially impertinent when I
choose. Cat!”

House, Denver Castle, in company with a deaf and aged lady and an
antique portmanteau.

“Caught anything?”

“I don't know whether to call it anything or not, my lord,” said Bunter,
dubiously. “I'll bring the prints in.”

==> “Do,” said Wimsey. “Hallo! here's our advertisement about the gold chain <==
in _The Times_—very nice it looks: 'Write, 'phone or call 110a
Piccadilly.' Perhaps it would have been safer to put a box number,
though I always think that the franker you are with people, the more
you're likely to deceive 'em; so unused is the modern world to the open
hand and the guileless heart, what?”

don't blow like that, you might be a whale.” He nipped up an almost
invisible object from the linen.

“What is it?” asked Parker.

==> “It's a hair,” said Wimsey grimly, his hard eyes growing harder. “Let's <==
go and look at Levy's hats, shall we? And you might just ring for that
fellow with the churchyard name, do you mind?”

Mr. Graves, when summoned, found Lord Peter Wimsey squatting on the
floor of the dressing-room before a row of hats arranged upside down

before him.

“Here you are,” said that nobleman cheerfully. “Now, Graves, this is a
guessin' competition—a sort of three-hat trick, to mix metaphors. Here

Parker made a grimace.

“Well,” he said, “I don't suppose you'd ever do it, so I'd better.
You'll never become a professional till you learn to do a little work,
==> Wimsey. How about lunch?” <==

“I'm invited out,” said Lord Peter, magnificently. “I'll run round and
change at the club. Can't feed with Freddy Arbuthnot in these bags;

“Oh, foolin' about,” said Lord Peter, languidly.

“Thick or clear, sir?” inquired the waiter of the Honourable Freddy.

==> “Which'll you have, Wimsey?” said that gentleman, transferring the <==
burden of selection to his guest, “they're both equally poisonous.”

“Well, clear's less trouble to lick out of the spoon,” said Lord Peter.

“Clear,” said the Honourable Freddy.

“P'r'aps he's gone off on his own,” suggested Lord Peter. “Double life,
you know. Giddy old blighters, some of these City men.”

“Oh, no,” said the Honourable Freddy, faintly roused; “no, hang it all,
==> Wimsey, I wouldn't care to say that. He's a decent old domestic bird, <==
and his daughter's a charmin' girl. Besides, he's straight enough—he'd
_do_ you down fast enough, but he wouldn't _let_ you down. Old Anderson
is badly cut up about it.”

“Who's Anderson?”

Mr. John P. Milligan, the London representative of the great Milligan
railroad and shipping company, was dictating code cables to his
secretary in an office in Lombard Street, when a card was brought up to
him, bearing the simple legend:

==>                            Lord Peter Wimsey <==
                                              Marlborough Club

Mr. Milligan was annoyed at the interruption, but, like many of his
nation, if he had a weak point, it was the British aristocracy. He
postponed for a few minutes the elimination from the map of a modest but

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 2042    window = 2037 2047


uncommonly good of you to let me come round wastin' your time like this.
I'll try not to be too long about it, though I'm not awfully good at
comin' to the point. My brother never would let me stand for the county,
y'know—said I wandered on so nobody'd know what I was talkin' about.”

==> “Pleased to meet you, Lord Wimsey,” said Mr. Milligan. “Won't you take a <==
seat?”

“Thanks,” said Lord Peter, “but I'm not a peer, you know—that's my
brother Denver. My name's Peter. It's a silly name, I always think, so
old-world and full of homely virtue and that sort of thing, but my

up five columns of figures simultaneously and jot down the answer.

“Dyed his hair, did he?” said Mr. Milligan.

“Dyed it red,” said Lord Peter. The secretary looked up. “Odd thing is,”
==> continued Wimsey, “they can't lay hands on the bottle. Somethin' fishy <==
there, don't you think, what?”

The secretary's interest seemed to have evaporated. He inserted a fresh
sheet into his looseleaf ledger, and carried forward a row of digits
from the preceding page.

“Oh, an absolutely dud enterprise that hadn't been heard of for years.
It suddenly took a little lease of life last week. I happened to notice
it because my mother got let in for a couple of hundred shares a long
time ago. It never paid a dividend. Now it's petered out again.”

==> Wimsey pushed his plate aside and lit a pipe. <==

“Having finished, I don't mind doing some work,” he said. “How did you
get on yesterday?”

ridiculous to suppose that the same man was employed in committing two
totally distinct crimes on the same night, one in Battersea and the
other in Park Lane.”

==> “I know,” said Wimsey, “though of course we mustn't forget that Levy was <==
in Battersea at the time, and now we know he didn't return home at
twelve as was supposed, we've no reason to think he ever left Battersea
at all.”

“True. But there are other places in Battersea besides Thipps's

unusual one, owing to the peculiar strength of the lenses and the marked
difference between the sight of the two eyes.

“That's good enough,” said Parker.

There remain Possibility No. 1: Accident or Misunderstanding, and No. 2:
Deliberate Villainy, of a remarkably bold and calculating kind—of a

“I say,” said the latter, “has somebody done something really wicked at
last? Whatever brings such a distinguished amateur of crime on our sober
doorstep?”

“I have been the victim of a vulgar attempt at blackmail,” said the

“But that _is_ Lord Peter Wimsey,” said Mr. Wicks, “there's no mistaking
him. I saw him give evidence in the Attenbury emerald case. He's a big
little pot in his way, you know, and goes fishing with the head of
Scotland Yard.”

“Oh dear,” said Mr. Crimplesham.

Fate arranged that the nerves of Mr. Crimplesham should be tried that
afternoon. When, escorted by Mr. Wicks, he arrived at the Minster Hotel,
==> he was informed by the porter that Lord Peter Wimsey had strolled out, <==
mentioning that he thought of attending Evensong. “But his man is here,
sir,” he added, “if you like to leave a message.”

Mr. Wicks thought that on the whole it would be well to leave a message.
Mr. Bunter, on inquiry, was found to be sitting by the telephone,

definite seemed forthcoming from Inspector Sugg's inquiries. Jury and
witnesses had been convened accordingly for three o'clock. Mr. Parker
might altogether have missed the event, had he not run against Sugg that
morning at the Yard and extracted the information from him as one would
a reluctant tooth. Inspector Sugg, indeed, considered Mr. Parker rather
==> interfering; moreover, he was hand-in-glove with Lord Peter Wimsey, and <==
Inspector Sugg had no words for the interferingness of Lord Peter. He
could not, however, when directly questioned, deny that there was to be
an inquest that afternoon, nor could he prevent Mr. Parker from enjoying
the inalienable right of any interested British citizen to be present.
At a little before three, therefore, Mr. Parker was in his place, and

On returning to Great Ormond Street, Mr. Parker found a wire awaiting

“Wal, now,” he said, “I guess it's as interesting for us business men to
meet British aristocrats as it is for Britishers to meet American
railway kings, Duchess. And I guess I'll make as many mistakes talking
your kind of talk as you would make if you were tryin' to run a corner
of wheat in Chicago. Fancy now, I called that fine lad of yours Lord
==> Wimsey the other day, and he thought I'd mistaken him for his brother. <==
That made me feel rather green.”

This was an unhoped-for lead. The Duchess walked warily.

“Dear boy,” she said, “I am so glad you met him, Mr. Milligan. _Both_ my

“Well, if you like, even because he has taken a fancy to you.”

“No, but——”

==> “Look here, Wimsey—do you think he _has_ murdered Levy?” <==

“Well, he may have.”

“But do you think he has?”

“David—his name is David—dancing before the ark of the Lord in the
face of the whole Cathedral Close.”

There was a pause.

==> “Tell me about the inquest,” said Wimsey. <==

Parker obliged with a summary of the evidence.

“Do you believe the body could have been concealed in the flat after
all?” he asked. “I know we looked, but I suppose we might have missed

“The knowledge of good and evil is a phenomenon of the brain, and is
removable, removable, removable. The knowledge of good and evil is
removable.”

==> Lord Peter Wimsey was not a young man who habitually took himself very <==
seriously, but this time he was frankly appalled. “It's impossible,”
said his reason, feebly; “credo quia impossible,” said his interior
certainty with impervious self-satisfaction. “All right,” said
conscience, instantly allying itself with blind faith, “what are you
going to do about it?”

This was too involved for Mr. Piggott.

“Never mind,” said Parker, soothingly, “he's always like that. You
mustn't take any notice. He can't help it. It's premature senile decay,
often observed in the families of hereditary legislators. Go away,
==> Wimsey, and play us the _Beggar's Opera_, or something.” <==

“That's good enough, isn't it?” said Lord Peter, when the happy Mr.
Piggott had been despatched home after a really delightful evening.

“I'm afraid so,” said Parker. “But it seems almost incredible.”

“I shall have it to-morrow. I thought of fixing up with the workhouse
people for to-morrow afternoon. I shall have to go and see them first.”

“Right you are; I'll let my mother know.”

==> “I begin to feel like you, Wimsey, I don't like this job.” <==

“I like it a deal better than I did.”

“You are really certain we're not making a mistake?”

“That's what I went down to see. I don't think so. Fact is, I don't
suppose anybody would imagine we'd exactly made a confidant of Piggott.
But I think you and I are in danger. You'll stay?”

==> “I'm damned if I will, Wimsey; why should I run away?” <==

“Bosh!” said Peter, “you'd run away all right if you believed me, and
why not? You don't believe me. In fact, you're still not certain I'm on
the right tack. Go in peace, but don't say I didn't warn you.”

The taxi drove off. Parker remounted the stairs and rang Lord Peter's
bell.

“Thanks, old man,” he said. “I'll stop the night, after all.”

==> “Come in,” said Wimsey. <==

“Did you see that?” asked Parker.

“I saw something. What happened exactly?”

Peter laughed.

“Blessed are they that have not seen and yet have believed. Bunter, Mr.
Parker will stay the night.”

==> “Look here, Wimsey, let's have another look at this business. Where's <==
that letter?”

Lord Peter produced Bunter's essay in dialogue. Parker studied it for a
short time in silence.


[line number in individual story] matching line = 5750    window = 5745 5755

that letter?”

Lord Peter produced Bunter's essay in dialogue. Parker studied it for a
short time in silence.

==> “You know, Wimsey. I'm as full of objections to this idea as an egg is <==
of meat.”

“So'm I, old son. That's why I want to dig up our Chelsea pauper. But
trot out your objections.”

“Yes; but it's not quite so simple as you make out. What was Levy doing
in that surreptitious way at Freke's on Monday night?”

“Well, you have Freke's explanation.”

==> “Rot, Wimsey. You said yourself it wouldn't do.” <==

“Excellent. It won't do. Therefore Freke was lying. Why should he lie
about it, unless he has some object in hiding the truth?”

“Well, but why mention it at all?”

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 5871    window = 5866 5876


“I don't know, but he was got there somehow. Why did Freke buy all those
Peruvian Oil shares?”

“I don't know,” said Parker in his turn.

==> “Anyway,” went on Wimsey, “Freke expected him, and made arrangements to <==
let him in himself, so that Cummings shouldn't see who the caller was.”

“But the caller left again at ten.”

“Oh, Charles! I did not expect this of you. This is the purest Suggery.

“And why Thipps's bathroom?”

“Why, indeed? Pure accident, perhaps—or pure devilry.”

“Do you think all this elaborate scheme could have been put together in
==> a night, Wimsey?” <==

“Far from it. It was conceived as soon as that man who bore a
superficial resemblance to Levy came into the workhouse. He had several
days.”

“Yes.”

“Because, if you haven't there'll probably be nobody to arrest.”

==> “My dear Wimsey, do you think I'm a fool?” <==

“I had no such hope.”

Parker grunted finally and departed.

“Nearly done, sir.” The demons fell to work again with the
pitchforks—no, spades.

Somebody sneezed. Parker located the sneezer and introduced him.

==> “Mr. Levett represents the Home Secretary. Lord Peter Wimsey. We are <==
sorry to drag you out on such a day, Mr. Levett.”

“It's all in the day's work,” said Mr. Levett, hoarsely. He was muffled
to the eyes.

Lumbering footsteps. Catch hold of Parker's trench-coat again. “That
you, old man? Oh, I beg your pardon, Mr. Levett—thought you were
Parker.”

==> “Hullo, Wimsey—here you are.” <==

More graves. A headstone shouldered crookedly aslant. A trip and jerk
over the edge of the rough grass. The squeal of gravel under your feet.

“This way, gentlemen, mind the step.”

for coming.”

There was a pause, while the two women went out, Parker, collected and
helpful, escorted them to their waiting car. Then Dr. Grimbold again:

Lord Peter considered this.

the _Letter of a Self-made Merchant to His Son_, bound in polished
morocco. He drew an umbrella from beneath his arm and added it to the

newspaper over the fair, scrubbed surface of the table, he began to roll
up his sleeves and insinuate himself into a pair of surgical gloves. Sir
Reuben Levy's valet, entering at the moment and finding him thus

“D'you have to do much of this sort of thing?” inquired Mr. Graves, from
a superior standpoint.

“Yes, my lord,” said Bunter. They were walking up the street together.

“There is the office over the way,” pursued Lord Peter. “I think,
==> Bunter, you might step into this little shop and purchase a sporting <==
paper, and if I do not emerge from the villain's lair—say within
three-quarters of an hour, you may take such steps as your perspicuity
may suggest.”

Mr. Bunter turned into the shop as desired, and Lord Peter walked across

==> Mr. Bunter turned into the shop as desired, and Lord Peter walked across <==
and rang the lawyer's bell with decision.

“The truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth is my long suit
here, I fancy,” he murmured, and when the door was opened by a clerk, he
delivered over his card with an unflinching air.

entered to “show this person out.”

In the entrance Lord Peter brushed against a tall young man who was just
coming in, and who stared at him with surprised recognition. His face,
however, aroused no memories in Lord Peter's mind, and the baffled
==> gentleman, calling out Bunter from the newspaper shop, departed to his <==
hotel to get a trunk-call through to Parker.

Meanwhile in the office, the meditations of the indignant Mr.
Crimplesham were interrupted by the entrance of his junior partner.

he was informed by the porter that Lord Peter Wimsey had strolled out,
mentioning that he thought of attending Evensong. “But his man is here,
sir,” he added, “if you like to leave a message.”

Mr. Wicks thought that on the whole it would be well to leave a message.
==> Mr. Bunter, on inquiry, was found to be sitting by the telephone, <==
waiting for a trunk-call. As Mr. Wicks addressed him the bell rang, and
Mr. Bunter, politely excusing himself, took down the receiver.

“Hullo!” he said. “Is that Mr. Parker? Oh, thanks! Exchange! Exchange!
Sorry, can you put me through to Scotland Yard? Excuse me, gentlemen,

Parker drank tea in silence, watching him. On the whole, however, he
remained but little interested in the causes of nervous phenomena and
his mind strayed to Lord Peter, coping with the redoubtable Crimplesham
down in Salisbury. Lord Peter had wanted him to come; that meant, either
that Crimplesham was proving recalcitrant or that a clue wanted
==> following. But Bunter had said that to-morrow would do, and it was just <==
as well. After all, the Battersea affair was not Parker's case; he had
already wasted valuable time attending an inconclusive inquest, and he
really ought to get on with his legitimate work. There was still Levy's
secretary to see and the little matter of the Peruvian Oil to be looked
into. He looked at his watch.

On returning to the flat just before lunchtime on the following morning,
after a few confirmatory researches in Balham and the neighbourhood of
==> Victoria Station, Lord Peter was greeted at the door by Mr. Bunter (who <==
had gone straight home from Waterloo), with a telephone message and a
severe and nursemaidlike eye.

“Lady Swaffham rang me up, my lord, and said she hoped your lordship had
not forgotten you were lunching with her.”

[line number in individual story] matching line = 3913    window = 3908 3918

“Lady Swaffham rang me up, my lord, and said she hoped your lordship had
not forgotten you were lunching with her.”

==> “I have forgotten, Bunter, and I mean to forget, I trust you told her I <==
had succumbed to lethargic encephalitis suddenly, no flowers by
request.”

“Lady Swaffham said, my lord, she was counting on you. She met the
Duchess of Denver yesterday——”

“What's she doing in town?”

“I imagine she came up for the inquest, my lord.”

==> “Oh yes—we missed that, Bunter.” <==

“Yes, my lord. Her Grace is lunching with Lady Swaffham.”

“Bunter, I can't. I can't, really. Say I'm in bed with whooping cough
and ask my mother to come round after lunch.”

When an immaculate Lord Peter was ushered, rather late for lunch, into
Lady Swaffham's drawing-room the Dowager Duchess of Denver was seated on
a sofa, plunged in intimate conversation with Mr. John P. Milligan of
Chicago.

[line number in individual story] matching line = 4515    window = 4510 4520

“Somewhere,” said Lord Peter to himself, “somewhere I've got the key to
these two things. I know I've got it, only I can't remember what it is.
Somebody said it. Perhaps I said it. I can't remember where, but I know
==> I've got it. Go to bed, Bunter, I shall sit up a little. I'll just slip <==
on a dressing-gown.”

Before the fire he sat down with his pipe in his mouth and his jazzy
coloured peacocks gathered about him. He traced out this line and that
line of investigation—rivers running into the sand. They ran out from

them, very faintly, lipping and gurgling somewhere in the darkness. But
where? He felt quite sure that somebody had told him once, only he had
forgotten.

He roused himself, threw a log on the fire, and picked up a book which
==> the indefatigable Bunter, carrying on his daily fatigues amid the <==
excitements of special duty, had brought from the Times Book Club. It
happened to be Sir Julian Freke's _Physiological Bases of the
Conscience_, which he had seen reviewed two days before.

A log broke across and sank into a fluff of white ash. A belated

    going early as a rule, like the one I mentioned.

colourful and gilded paradise in a mediæval painting.

So've I, and met Sugg, and he told me he'd seen you. He was cross, too.
Unwarrantable interference, he calls it.”

Semitic-looking stranger in Mr. Thipps's bath was by any extraordinary
chance Sir Reuben Levy. But he isn't.”

“Sir Reuben Levy? Wait a minute, I saw something about that. I know! A

those simple things that offer no handle. Sir Reuben Levy dined last
night with three friends at the Ritz. After dinner the friends went to
the theatre. He refused to go with them on account of an appointment. I
haven't yet been able to trace the appointment, but anyhow, he returned
home to his house—9a Park Lane—at twelve o'clock.”

“The cook, who had just gone up to bed, saw him on the doorstep, and
heard him let himself in. He walked upstairs, leaving his greatcoat on
the hall peg and his umbrella in the stand—you remember how it rained
last night. He undressed and went to bed. Next morning he wasn't there.
==> That's all,” said Parker abruptly, with a wave of the hand. <==

“It isn't all, it isn't all. Daddy, go on, that's not _half_ a story,”
pleaded Lord Peter.

“But it _is_ all. When his man came to call him he wasn't there. The bed

always kept.”

Lord Peter whistled.

==> “You've got me there, Parker. Even if he'd gone out to commit suicide <==
he'd have taken those.”

“So you'd think—or the suicide would have happened the first time he
started to cross the road. However, I didn't overlook the possibility.
I've got particulars of all to-day's street accidents, and I can lay my

remember to clean his teeth and put his boots out. Those are two things
that quite frequently get overlooked, my lord.”

“If you mean anything personal, Bunter,” said Lord Peter, “I can only
say that I think the speech an unworthy one. It's a sweet little

dearly love to see that bedroom to-morrow. ’Tis not that I mistrust
thee, dear, but I should uncommonly like to see it. Say me not nay—take

“Of course you can come and see it—you'll probably find lots of things
I've overlooked,” said the other, equably, accepting the proffered
hospitality.

==> “Parker, acushla, you're an honour to Scotland Yard. I look at you, and <==
Sugg appears a myth, a fable, an idiot-boy, spawned in a moonlight hour
by some fantastic poet's brain. Sugg is too perfect to be possible. What

we are not Jesuits, we are straightforward Englishmen. You cannot ask a
British-born jury to convict any man on the authority of a probable
opinion.' Hum of applause.”

==> “Biggs' man was guilty all the same,” said Parker. <==

“Of course he was. But he was acquitted all the same, an' what you've
just said is libel,” Wimsey walked over to the bookshelf and took down a
volume of Medical Jurisprudence. “'_Rigor mortis_—can only be stated in
a very general way—many factors determine the result.' Cautious brute.

however, it may appear unusually early, or be retarded unusually long'!

“I've just put an advertisement in _The Times_ about it,” said Lord
Peter. “Go on.”

“He had had the glasses some time—they had been mended twice.”

“Not specially, I'm afraid—why?”

“Never mind—go on.”

“Yes; did you notice that the soot on the window-sill was vaguely
marked?”

“I did,” said Wimsey, “and I examined it hard with this little fellow,
but I could make nothing of it except that something or other had rested
==> on the sill.” He drew out his monocle and handed it to Parker. <==

“My word, that's a powerful lens.”

“It is,” said Wimsey, “and jolly useful when you want to take a good
squint at somethin' and look like a bally fool all the time. Only it

squint at somethin' and look like a bally fool all the time. Only it
don't do to wear it permanently—if people see you full-face they say:
'Dear me! how weak the sight of that eye must be!' Still, it's useful.”

“Sugg and I explored the ground at the back of the building,” went on

“That's interestin'. Did you try the roof?”

“No.”

his body in strong carbolic soap—so strong that the smell hangs about
twenty-four hours later.”

“Carbolic to get rid of the fleas.”

point: Carefully got-up gentleman, with manicured, though masticated,
finger-nails, has filthy black toenails which look as if they hadn't
been cut for years.”

“All of a piece with habits as indicated.”

Bunter got up and appeared suddenly at the detective's elbow, the
respectful man-servant all over.

“A little more brandy, sir?” he murmured.

==> “Wimsey,” said Parker, “you are making me feel cold all over.” He <==
emptied his glass—stared at it as though he were surprised to find it
empty, set it down, got up, walked across to the bookcase, turned round,
stood with his back against it and said:

“Look here, Wimsey—you've been reading detective stories, you're

“No, I ain't,” said Lord Peter, sleepily, “uncommon good incident for a
detective story, though, what? Bunter, we'll write one, and you shall
illustrate it with photographs.”

==> “Soap in his—Rubbish!” said Parker. “It was something else—some <==
discoloration—”

“No,” said Lord Peter, “there were hairs as well. Bristly ones. He had a
beard.”

He took his watch from his pocket, and drew out a couple of longish,
stiff hairs, which he had imprisoned between the inner and the outer
case.

==> Parker turned them over once or twice in his fingers, looked at them <==
close to the light, examined them with a lens, handed them to the
impassible Bunter, and said:

“Do you mean to tell me, Wimsey, that any man alive would”—he laughed
harshly—“shave off his beard with his mouth open, and then go and get

was spoilt by a long, narrow chin, and a long, receding forehead,
accentuated by the brushed-back sleekness of his tow-coloured hair.
Labour papers, softening down the chin, caricatured him as a typical
aristocrat.

He ran back, and the other two men employed a few minutes of his absence
in capturing a taxi.

Inspector Sugg and a subordinate Cerberus were on guard at 59 Queen
Caroline Mansions, and showed no disposition to admit unofficial

Peter found himself confronted with a surly manner and what Lord
Beaconsfield described as a masterly inactivity. It was in vain that
Lord Peter pleaded that he had been retained by Mrs. Thipps on behalf of
her son.

Lord Peter laughed and yawned.

“I think I'll turn in for an hour or two,” he said. “I must be back in

The Duchess looked at the clock, which marked five minutes to three.

“I'll send up your breakfast at half-past six, dear,” she said. “I hope
you'll find everything all right. I told them just to slip a hot-water

==> “--So there it is, Parker,” said Lord Peter, pushing his coffee-cup <==
aside and lighting his after-breakfast pipe; “you may find it leads you
to something, though it don't seem to get me any further with my
bathroom problem. Did you do anything more at that after I left?”

“No; but I've been on the roof this morning.”

to something, though it don't seem to get me any further with my

“No; but I've been on the roof this morning.”

==> “The deuce you have—what an energetic devil you are! I say, Parker, I <==
think this co-operative scheme is an uncommonly good one. It's much
easier to work on someone else's job than one's own—gives one that
delightful feelin' of interferin' and bossin' about, combined with the
glorious sensation that another fellow is takin' all one's own work off
one's hands. You scratch my back and I'll scratch yours, what? Did you

can walk along as easy as along Shaftesbury Avenue. Still, I've got some
evidence that the body did walk along there.”

“What's that?”

==> Parker brought out his pocket-book and extracted a few shreds of <==
material, which he laid before his friend.

“One was caught in the gutter just above Thipps's bathroom window,
another in a crack of the stone parapet just over it, and the rest came
from the chimney-stack behind, where they had caught in an iron

“I don't, fathead,” said Lord Peter, with the easy politeness of the
real aristocracy, “that's why I've tried to get hold of the jeweller who
originally sold the chain. See?” He pointed to the paragraph. “It's not
an old chain—hardly worn at all. Oh, thanks, Bunter. Now, see here,
==> Parker, these are the finger-marks you noticed yesterday on the <==
window-sash and on the far edge of the bath. I'd overlooked them; I give
you full credit for the discovery. I crawl, I grovel, my name is Watson,
and you need not say what you were just going to say, because I admit it
all. Now we shall——Hullo, hullo, hullo!”

Take the fool away, gentlemen.”

He put the prints aside, and returned to an examination of the shreds of
material in his hand. Suddenly he whistled softly.

==> “Do you make anything of these, Parker?” <==

“They seemed to me to be ravellings of some coarse cotton stuff—a
sheet, perhaps, or an improvised rope.”

“Yes,” said Lord Peter—“yes. It may be a mistake—it may be _our_

enough and strong enough to hang a man?”

He was silent, his long eyes narrowing into slits behind the smoke of
his pipe.

==> “What do you suggest doing this morning?” asked Parker. <==

“Well,” said Lord Peter, “it seems to me it's about time I took a hand
in your job. Let's go round to Park Lane and see what larks Sir Reuben
Levy was up to in bed last night.”

“Five-foot-ten,” said Lord Peter, “and not an inch more.” He peered
dubiously at the depression in the bed-clothes, and measured it a second
==> time with the gentleman-scout's vade-mecum. Parker entered this <==
particular in a neat pocket-book.

“I suppose,” he said, “a six-foot-two man might leave a five-foot-ten
depression if he curled himself up.”

bent over the pillow, breathing hard and tightly through his nose.
“Here, give me the tweezers,” he said presently; “good heavens, man,
don't blow like that, you might be a whale.” He nipped up an almost
invisible object from the linen.

==> “What is it?” asked Parker. <==

“It's a hair,” said Wimsey grimly, his hard eyes growing harder. “Let's
go and look at Levy's hats, shall we? And you might just ring for that
fellow with the churchyard name, do you mind?”

“Here I am, my lord,” said Mr. Bunter, with respectful reproach, “but if
you'll excuse me saying so, downstairs is where I ought to be, with all
those young women about—they'll be fingering the evidence, my lord.”

“I cry you mercy,” said Lord Peter, “but I've quarrelled hopelessly with

me what finger-prints you have found. I shan't be happy till I get it,
so don't be harsh with me, Bunter.”

“Well, my lord, your lordship understands I haven't photographed them

domestics——”

His features expressed disdain.

==> “What did I say, Parker? Five-foot-ten and not an inch longer. And he <==
didn't dare to use the hair-brush. Beautiful. But he _had_ to risk the
top-hat. Gentleman can't walk home in the rain late at night without a
hat, you know, Parker. Look! what do you make of it? Two sets of
finger-prints on everything but the book and the brush, two sets of feet
on the linoleum, and two kinds of hair in the hat!”

to the skin. He had rubber gloves on his hands which he never took off,
and he did everything he could to make us think that Levy slept here

undressed, he even washed and cleaned his teeth, though he didn't use
the hair-brush for fear of leaving red hairs in it. He had to guess what

work Sugg ever did, and I'd get the family history of every tenant of
every flat in Queen Caroline Mansions. I'd examine all their box-rooms
and roof-traps, and I would inveigle them into conversations and
suddenly bring in the words 'body' and 'pince-nez,' and see if they
wriggled, like those modern psycho-what's-his-names.”

==> Mr. Parker was a bachelor, and occupied a Georgian but inconvenient flat <==
at No. 12a Great Ormond Street, for which he paid a pound a week. His
exertions in the cause of civilisation were rewarded, not by the gift of
diamonds, rings from empresses or munificent cheques from grateful Prime
Ministers, but by a modest, though sufficient, salary, drawn from the
pockets of the British taxpayer. He awoke, after a long day of arduous

“His lordship says he'd be very glad, sir, if you could make it
convenient to step round to breakfast.”

If the odour of kidneys and bacon had been wafted along the wire, Mr.
==> Parker could not have experienced a more vivid sense of consolation. <==

“Tell his lordship I'll be with him in half an hour,” he said,
thankfully, and plunging into the bathroom, which was also the kitchen,
he informed Mrs. Munns, who was just making tea from a kettle which had
gone off the boil, that he should be out to breakfast.

“Mornin', old dear,” said that gentleman; “beast of a day, ain't it?
Very good of you to trundle out in it, but I had a letter I wanted you
to see, and I hadn't the energy to come round to your place. Bunter and
I've been makin' a night of it.”

==> “What's the letter?” asked Parker. <==

“Never talk business with your mouth full,” said Lord Peter,
reprovingly; “have some Oxford marmalade—and then I'll show you my
Dante; they brought it round last night. What ought I to read this
morning, Bunter?”

away.”

There was silence, but for the crunching of toast and the crackling of
paper.

==> “I see they adjourned the inquest,” said Parker presently. <==

“Nothing else to do,” said Lord Peter, “but Lady Levy arrived last
night, and will have to go and fail to identify the body this morning
for Sugg's benefit.”

Silence fell again.

“I don't think much of your burglary, Bunter,” said Lord Peter.
“Competent, of course, but no imagination. I want imagination in a

entertaining enough as far as it went, but the fellow's got a bee in his
bonnet. Thinks God's a secretion of the liver—all right once in a way,
but there's no need to keep on about it. There's nothing you can't prove
if your outlook is only sufficiently limited. Look at Sugg.”

==> “I beg your pardon,” said Parker. “I wasn't attending. Argentines are <==
steadying a little, I see.”

“Milligan,” said Lord Peter.

“Oil's in a bad way. Levy's made a difference there. That funny little

Wimsey pushed his plate aside and lit a pipe.

“Having finished, I don't mind doing some work,” he said. “How did you
get on yesterday?”

==> “I didn't,” replied Parker. “I sleuthed up and down those flats in my <==
own bodily shape and two different disguises. I was a gas-meter man and
a collector for a Home for Lost Doggies, and I didn't get a thing to go
on, except a servant in the top flat at the Battersea Bridge Road end of
the row who said she thought she heard a bump on the roof one night.
Asked which night, she couldn't rightly say. Asked if it was Monday

There's no entry for Monday.”

“I expect it'll be useful,” said Lord Peter, turning over the pages.
“Poor old buffer. I say, I'm not so certain now he was done away with.”

==> He detailed to Mr. Parker his day's work. <==

“Arbuthnot?” said Parker, “is that the Arbuthnot of the diary?”

“I suppose so. I hunted him up because I knew he was fond of fooling
round the Stock Exchange. As for Milligan, he _looks_ all right, but I

“Ah, that's the letter I mentioned to you. Where did I put it?—here we
are. Good parchment paper, printed address of solicitor's office in
Salisbury, and postmark to correspond. Very precisely written with a
fine nib by an elderly business man of old-fashioned habits.”

==> “Dear me,” said Parker, “this is what you might call unexpected.” <==

“Either it is some extraordinary misunderstanding,” said Lord Peter, “or
Mr. Crimplesham is a very bold and cunning villain. Or possibly, of
course, they are the wrong glasses. We may as well get a ruling on that
point at once. I suppose the glasses are at the Yard. I wish you'd just

point at once. I suppose the glasses are at the Yard. I wish you'd just
ring 'em up and ask 'em to send round an optician's description of them
at once—and you might ask at the same time whether it's a very common
prescription.”

==> “Right you are,” said Parker, and took the receiver off its hook. <==

“And now,” said his friend, when the message was delivered, “just come
into the library for a minute.”

On the library table, Lord Peter had spread out a series of bromide

[line number in individual story] matching line = 2448    window = 2443 2453

again. Which makes me infer that the stranger came back to Park Lane,
wearing Levy's boots, in a cab, carriage or car, but that at some point
or other he walked a little way—just enough to tread in a puddle and
get a splash on the boots. What do you say?”

==> “Very pretty,” said Parker. “A bit intricate, though, and the marks are <==
not all that I could wish a finger-print to be.”

“Well, I won't lay too much stress on it. But it fits in with our
previous ideas. Now let's turn to:

hand the card to the secretary, and when I got into the inner shrine I
saw John P. Milligan standing with it in his hand, so it's one or the
other, and for the moment it's immaterial to our purpose which is which.
I boned the card from the table when I left.

==> “Well, now, Parker, here's what's been keeping Bunter and me up till the <==
small hours. I've measured and measured every way backwards and forwards
till my head's spinnin', and I've stared till I'm nearly blind, but I'm
hanged if I can make my mind up. Question 1. Is C identical with B?
Question 2. Is D or E identical with B? There's nothing to go on but the
size and shape, of course, and the marks are so faint—what do you

Question 2. Is D or E identical with B? There's nothing to go on but the
size and shape, of course, and the marks are so faint—what do you
think?”

==> Parker shook his head doubtfully. <==

“I think E might almost be put out of the question,” he said, “it seems
such an excessively long and narrow thumb. But I think there is a
decided resemblance between the span of B on the water-bottle and C on
the bath. And I don't see any reason why D shouldn't be the same as B

“Your untutored judgment and my measurements have brought us both to the
same conclusion—if you can call it a conclusion,” said Lord Peter,
bitterly.

==> “Another thing,” said Parker. “Why on earth should we try to connect B <==
with C? The fact that you and I happen to be friends doesn't make it
necessary to conclude that the two cases we happen to be interested in
have any organic connection with one another. Why should they? The only
person who thinks they have is Sugg, and he's nothing to go by. It would
be different if there were any truth in the suggestion that the man in

The note from Scotland Yard enclosed an optician's specification
identical with that sent by Mr. Crimplesham, and added that it was an
unusual one, owing to the peculiar strength of the lenses and the marked
difference between the sight of the two eyes.

==> “That's good enough,” said Parker. <==

“Yes,” said Wimsey. “Then Possibility No. 3 is knocked on the head.
There remain Possibility No. 1: Accident or Misunderstanding, and No. 2:
Deliberate Villainy, of a remarkably bold and calculating kind—of a
kind, in fact, characteristic of the author or authors of our two

“Finally, gentlemen, I will frankly point out the weak point of all
these hypotheses, namely: that none of them offers any explanation as to
why the incriminating article was left so conspicuously on the body in
the first instance.”

==> Mr. Parker had listened with commendable patience to this academic <==
exposition.

“Might not X,” he suggested, “be an enemy of Crimplesham's, who designed
to throw suspicion upon him?”

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 2612    window = 2607 2617


“How about the first possibility of all, misunderstanding or accident?”

“Well! Well, for purposes of discussion, nothing, because it really
doesn't afford any data for discussion.”

==> “In any case,” said Parker, “the obvious course appears to be to go to <==
Salisbury.”

“That seems indicated,” said Lord Peter.

“Very well,” said the detective, “is it to be you or me or both of us?”

Crimplesham-X by delivering over to him the only two men in London with
the evidence, such as it is, and shall I say the wits, to connect him
with the Battersea body?”

“But if we told the Yard where we were going, and we both got nobbled,”
==> said Mr. Parker, “it would afford strong presumptive evidence of <==
Crimplesham's guilt, and anyhow, if he didn't get hanged for murdering
the man in the bath he'd at least get hanged for murdering us.”

“Well,” said Lord Peter, “if he only murdered me you could still hang
him—what's the good of wasting a sound, marriageable young male like

threatening him with _you_, which, seeing you hold what evidence there
is, is much more to the point. And, then, suppose it's a wild-goose
chase after all, you'll have wasted time when you might have been
getting on with the case. There are several things that need doing.”

==> “Well,” said Parker, silenced but reluctant, “why can't I go, in that <==
case?”

“Bosh!” said Lord Peter. “I am retained (by old Mrs. Thipps, for whom I
entertain the greatest respect) to deal with this case, and it's only by
courtesy I allow you to have anything to do with it.”

“Will you at least take Bunter?” he said.

“In deference to your feelings,” replied Lord Peter, “I will take
Bunter, though he could be far more usefully employed taking photographs

Bunter?”

“There is an excellent train at 10.50, my lord.”

“Kindly make arrangements to catch it,” said Lord Peter, throwing off
==> his bathrobe and trailing away with it into his bedroom. “And Parker—if <==
you have nothing else to do you might get hold of Levy's secretary and
look into that little matter of the Peruvian oil.”

Lord Peter took with him, for light reading in the train, Sir Reuben
Levy's diary. It was a simple, and in the light of recent facts, rather

“My good man,” he said, “this is a very impudent attempt, but blackmail
is an indictable offence, and I advise you to leave my office before you
commit yourself.” He rang the bell.

“I was afraid you'd take it like that,” said Lord Peter. “It looks as

all.” He laid Parker's card on the table beside the specification, and
added: “If you should wish to see me again, Mr. Crimplesham, before
to-morrow morning, you will find me at the Minster Hotel.”

Mr. Crimplesham disdained to reply further than to direct the clerk who

In the entrance Lord Peter brushed against a tall young man who was just
coming in, and who stared at him with surprised recognition. His face,
however, aroused no memories in Lord Peter's mind, and the baffled
gentleman, calling out Bunter from the newspaper shop, departed to his
==> hotel to get a trunk-call through to Parker. <==

Meanwhile in the office, the meditations of the indignant Mr.
Crimplesham were interrupted by the entrance of his junior partner.

Mr. Wicks thought that on the whole it would be well to leave a message.
Mr. Bunter, on inquiry, was found to be sitting by the telephone,
waiting for a trunk-call. As Mr. Wicks addressed him the bell rang, and
Mr. Bunter, politely excusing himself, took down the receiver.

When an expostulation by a woman juror—an elderly lady in spectacles

course—but one finds oneself being so Elizabethan nowadays—what an
awful little man the Coroner is, isn't he? He's looking daggers at
me—do you think he'll dare to clear me out of the court or commit me
for what-you-may-call-it?”

==> The first part of the evidence was not of great interest to Mr. Parker. <==
The wretched Mr. Thipps, who had caught cold in gaol, deposed in an
unhappy croak to having discovered the body, when he went to take his
bath at eight o'clock. He had had such a shock, he had to sit down and
send the girl for brandy. He had never seen the deceased before. He had
no idea how he came there.

should permit the prisoner—Mr. Thipps—to give evidence at all. It is a
delicate position.”

The perspiration stood on Mr. Thipps's forehead.

==> “Save us from our friends,” whispered the Duchess to Parker. “If that <==
cough-drop-devouring creature had openly instructed those fourteen
people—and what unfinished-looking faces they have—so characteristic,
I always think, of the lower middle-class, rather like sheep, or calves'
head (boiled, I mean), to bring in wilful murder against the poor little
man, he couldn't have made himself plainer.”

==> “He can't let him incriminate himself, you know,” said Parker. <==

“Stuff!” said the Duchess. “How could the man incriminate himself when
he never did anything in his life? You men never think of anything but
your red tape.”

as the ominous pertinence of the last phrase smote upon him, “I'm sure I
couldn't do that.”

“Well, well,” said the Coroner.

the little man,” she said.

Mr. Thipps resumed.

“When we got to St. Pancras I was going home, but my friend said no. We

manner as he kissed the Book presented to him with the usual deprecatory
mumble by the Coroner's officer, was that of a St. Paul condescending to
humour the timid mumbo-jumbo of superstitious Corinthians.

==> “So handsome, I always think,” whispered the Duchess to Mr. Parker, <==
“just exactly like William Morris, with that bush of hair and beard and
those exciting eyes looking out of it—so splendid, these dear men
always devoted to something or other—not but what I think socialism is
a mistake—of course it works with all those nice people, so good and

“Hard at work,” said the specialist. “Just got my new book out. This
kind of thing wastes time. Have you seen Lady Levy yet?”

“No, poor dear,” said the Duchess. “I only came up this morning, for
this. Mrs. Thipps is staying with me—one of Peter's eccentricities, you

she added, “who is investigating that case.”

“I saw her this morning.”

“Did she ask you to go on with the inquiry?”

detained in the hands of some financial rival or that perhaps some
scoundrels are holding him to ransom.”

“And is that _your_ opinion?” asked Sir John.

“And is that _your_ opinion?” asked Sir John.

Sir Julian hesitated again.

“I wish you would walk back with me when this is over,” he said.

Sir Julian hesitated again.

“I wish you would walk back with me when this is over,” he said.

At this moment the jury returned and took their places, and there was a
little rustle and hush. The Coroner addressed the foreman and inquired
if they were agreed upon their verdict.

==> Mr. Parker and Sir Julian Freke walked up the road together. <==

“I had absolutely no idea until I saw Lady Levy this morning,” said the
doctor, “that there was any idea of connecting this matter with the
disappearance of Sir Reuben. The suggestion was perfectly monstrous, and
could only have grown up in the mind of that ridiculous police officer.

disappearance of Sir Reuben. The suggestion was perfectly monstrous, and
could only have grown up in the mind of that ridiculous police officer.
If I had had any idea what was in his mind I could have disabused him
and avoided all this.”

==> “I did my best to do so,” said Parker, “as soon as I was called in to <==
the Levy case——”

“Who called you in, if I may ask?” inquired Sir Julian.

“Well, the household first of all, and then Sir Reuben's uncle, Mr. Levy

“Well, the household first of all, and then Sir Reuben's uncle, Mr. Levy
of Portman Square, wrote to me to go on with the investigation.”

“And now Lady Levy has confirmed those instructions?”

Sir Julian was silent for a little time.

“I'm afraid I was the first person to put the idea into Sugg's head,”
said Parker, rather penitently. “When Sir Reuben disappeared, my first

“A strong superficial likeness,” said Sir Julian. “The upper part of the
face is a not uncommon type, and as Sir Reuben wore a heavy beard and
there was no opportunity of comparing the mouths and chins, I can
understand the idea occurring to anybody. But only to be dismissed at
once. I am sorry,” he added, “as the whole matter has been painful to

The two men stepped into a square, finely furnished hall with a
fireplace on the same side as the door, and a staircase opposite. The
dining-room door stood open on their right, and as Sir Julian rang the

bell a man-servant appeared at the far end of the hall.

“What will you take?” asked the doctor.

gallons of hot tea, if you, as a nerve specialist, can bear the thought
of it.”

“Provided you allow of a judicious blend of China in it,” replied Sir

“I don't use the downstairs rooms much, except the dining-room,” he
explained as he ushered his guest into a small but cheerful library on
the first floor. “This room leads out of my bedroom and is more
convenient. I only live part of my time here, but it's very handy for my

Mr. Parker assented to this.

“Very often,” said Sir Julian, “the only time I get for any research

“Quite so, quite so,” said Sir Julian; “you mean that the burglar, for

He sat for some minutes gazing into the fire, while the red light played
upon his tawny beard and struck out answering gleams from his compelling
eyes.

remained but little interested in the causes of nervous phenomena and
his mind strayed to Lord Peter, coping with the redoubtable Crimplesham
down in Salisbury. Lord Peter had wanted him to come; that meant, either

“Your work calls you?” he said, smiling. “Well, I can understand that. I

your present inquiry—only I hardly know—I hardly like——”

face and attitude.

“I shall be very grateful for any help you can give me,” he said.

“I'm afraid it's more in the nature of hindrance,” said Sir Julian, with
a short laugh. “It's a case of destroying a clue for you, and a breach

course,” he added hastily, “that I must inform my colleague.”

“You have a colleague in the case?”

“I have.”

On returning to Great Ormond Street, Mr. Parker found a wire awaiting
him, which said: “Do not trouble to come. All well. Returning to-morrow.

the Epistle to the Galatians. He received Lord Peter with quiet
pleasure, though without rapturous enthusiasm, and mixed him a
whiskey-and-soda. Peter took up the book his friend had laid down and
glanced over the pages.

“Hum,” said Lord Peter, “theology must be good exercise for the brain
then, for you're easily the most cautious devil I know. But I say, do go
on reading—it's a shame for me to come and root you up in your off-time
like this.”

==> “It's all right, old man,” said Parker. <==

The two men sat silent for a little, and then Lord Peter said:

“D'you like your job?”

there was any excuse for me buttin' in, since I don't have to make my
livin' by it. And I feel as if I oughtn't ever to find it amusin'. But I
do.”

==> Parker gave this speech his careful attention. <==

“I see what you mean,” he said.

“There's old Milligan, f'r instance,” said Lord Peter. “On paper,
nothin' would be funnier than to catch old Milligan out. But he's rather

me. It's awfully entertainin' goin' and pumpin' him with stuff about a
bazaar for church expenses, but when he's so jolly pleased about it and
that, I feel a worm. S'pose old Milligan has cut Levy's throat and
plugged him into the Thames. It ain't my business.”

==> “It's as much yours as anybody's,” said Parker; “it's no better to do it <==
for money than to do it for nothing.”

“Yes, it is,” said Peter stubbornly. “Havin' to live is the only excuse
there is for doin' that kind of thing.”

for money than to do it for nothing.”

“Yes, it is,” said Peter stubbornly. “Havin' to live is the only excuse
there is for doin' that kind of thing.”

==> “Well, but look here!” said Parker. “If Milligan has cut poor old Levy's <==
throat for no reason except to make himself richer, I don't see why he
should buy himself off by giving £1,000 to Duke's Denver church roof, or
why he should be forgiven just because he's childishly vain, or
childishly snobbish.”

And nobody but his own family or young Wicks seems to have anything to
gain by his death. And even if young Wicks wanted to make away with him,
it's rather far-fetched to go and murder an unknown man in Thipps's
place in order to stick Crimplesham's eyeglasses on his nose.”

==> “Where was young Wicks on Monday?” asked Parker. <==

“At a dance given by the Precentor,” said Lord Peter, wildly.
“David—his name is David—dancing before the ark of the Lord in the

There was a pause.

“Tell me about the inquest,” said Wimsey.

“Do you believe the body could have been concealed in the flat after
all?” he asked. “I know we looked, but I suppose we might have missed
something.”

had been there he would have found them, because he was looking for
them. Therefore, if he didn't find them it's because they weren't
there.”

==> “All right,” said Parker, “stop talking. I believe you.” <==

He went on to detail the medical evidence.

“By the way,” said Lord Peter, “to skip across for a moment to the other

recount his interview with the nerve-specialist.

He knocked out his pipe and rose to go.

it occur to you that Freke's story doesn't fit in awfully well with what
Anderson said about the old boy having been so jolly at dinner on Monday

==> Mr. Parker, summoned the next morning to 110a Piccadilly, arrived to <==
find the Dowager Duchess in possession. She greeted him charmingly.

“I am going to take this silly boy down to Denver for the weekend,” she
said, indicating Peter, who was writing and only acknowledged his

“I am going to take this silly boy down to Denver for the weekend,” she
said, indicating Peter, who was writing and only acknowledged his

always did have nightmares when he was quite a little boy—though very
often of course it was only a little pill he wanted; but he was so

forget all about a great war in a year or two, and, really, I ought to
be very thankful with both my boys safe. Still, I think a little peace
and quiet at Denver won't do him any harm.”

==> “Sorry you've been having a bad turn, old man,” said Parker, vaguely <==
sympathetic; “you're looking a bit seedy.”

“Charles,” said Lord Peter, in a voice entirely void of expression, “I
am going away for a couple of days because I can be no use to you in
London. What has got to be done for the moment can be much better done

during the last fortnight. You will see Sir Andrew Mackenzie personally,

that you have solved the problems of the Levy murder and the Battersea

no attention—“and you will ask him to have men in readiness with a
warrant to arrest a very dangerous and important criminal at any moment
on your information. When the replies to this paper come in, you will
search for any mention of St. Luke's Hospital, or of any person
connected with St. Luke's Hospital, and you will send for me at once.

and police warrants, or you may find yourself in Queer Street. I shall
come up to town as soon as I hear from you, and I shall expect to find a
nice ingenuous Sawbones here to meet me.” He grinned faintly.

==> “D'you mean you've got to the bottom of this thing?” asked Parker. <==

“Yes. I may be wrong. I hope I am, but I know I'm not.”

“You won't tell me?”

remembering that it was Saturday and there was need for haste, he hailed
a taxi.

he enjoyed the crisp air and the wet leaves washing darkly over his

sudden and violent deaths except aged setters—and partridges, to be

“A telegram, my lord.”

==> Mr. Parker, a faithful though doubting Thomas, had duly secured his <==
medical student: a large young man like an overgrown puppy, with
innocent eyes and a freckled face. He sat on the Chesterfield before
Lord Peter's library fire, bewildered in equal measure by his errand,
his surroundings and the drink which he was absorbing. His palate,
though untutored, was naturally a good one, and he realised that even to

call this liquid a drink—the term ordinarily used by him to designate
cheap whiskey, post-war beer or a dubious glass of claret in a Soho
restaurant—was a sacrilege; this was something outside normal
experience; a genie in a bottle.

before in the public-house at the corner of Prince of Wales Road, seemed
to be a good sort. He had insisted on bringing him round to see this
friend of his, who lived splendidly in Piccadilly. Parker was quite
understandable; he put him down as a government servant, or perhaps
something in the City. The friend was embarrassing; he was a lord, to

“No, no,” said Lord Peter, “it's me. I'm always askin' such stupid
questions, everybody thinks I must mean somethin' by 'em.”

This was too involved for Mr. Piggott.

mustn't take any notice. He can't help it. It's premature senile decay,
often observed in the families of hereditary legislators. Go away,

It was a raw, unpleasant night. A taxi deposited a load of people

secured it for himself. He was just giving the address to the driver,
when a man came hastily running up from a side street. He was in evening
dress and an overcoat. He rushed up, signalling frantically.

secured it for himself. He was just giving the address to the driver,
when a man came hastily running up from a side street. He was in evening
dress and an overcoat. He rushed up, signalling frantically.

==> “Sir—sir!—dear me! why, it's Mr. Parker! How fortunate! If you would <==
be so kind—summoned from the club—a sick friend—can't find a
taxi—everybody going home from the theatre—if I might share your
cab—you are returning to Bloomsbury? I want Russell Square—if I might
presume—a matter of life and death.”

taxi—everybody going home from the theatre—if I might share your
cab—you are returning to Bloomsbury? I want Russell Square—if I might
presume—a matter of life and death.”

He spoke in hurried gasps, as though he had been running violently and
==> far. Parker promptly stepped out of the taxi. <==

“Delighted to be of service to you, Sir Julian,” he said; “take my taxi.
I am going down to Craven Street myself, but I'm in no hurry. Pray make
use of the cab.”

I am going down to Craven Street myself, but I'm in no hurry. Pray make

“It's extremely kind of you,” said the surgeon. “I am ashamed——”

==> “That's all right,” said Parker, cheerily. “I can wait.” He assisted <==
Freke into the taxi. “What number? 24 Russell Square, driver, and look
sharp.”

The taxi drove off. Parker remounted the stairs and rang Lord Peter's
bell.

bell.

“Thanks, old man,” he said. “I'll stop the night, after all.”

“Come in,” said Wimsey.

“Thanks, old man,” he said. “I'll stop the night, after all.”

“Come in,” said Wimsey.

==> “Did you see that?” asked Parker. <==

“I saw something. What happened exactly?”

Parker told his story. “Frankly,” he said, “I've been thinking you a bit
mad, but now I'm not quite so sure of it.”

Peter laughed.

“Blessed are they that have not seen and yet have believed. Bunter, Mr.

“Look here, Wimsey, let's have another look at this business. Where's
that letter?”

Lord Peter produced Bunter's essay in dialogue. Parker studied it for a

Parker will stay the night.”

“Look here, Wimsey, let's have another look at this business. Where's

short time in silence.

“You know, Wimsey. I'm as full of objections to this idea as an egg is

“Well, then, we come back to the first question: Why did Levy go there?”

“I don't know, but he was got there somehow. Why did Freke buy all those
Peruvian Oil shares?”

==> “I don't know,” said Parker in his turn. <==

“Anyway,” went on Wimsey, “Freke expected him, and made arrangements to
let him in himself, so that Cummings shouldn't see who the caller was.”

“But the caller left again at ten.”

“I don't say he didn't get back from Park Lane before three. But I don't
suppose Cummings went and looked through the bathroom keyhole to see if
he was in the bath.”

==> Parker considered again. <==

“How about Crimplesham's pince-nez?” he asked.

“That is a bit mysterious,” said Lord Peter.

“What made him lose his head?”

mother's son having foolishly advertised in _The Times_ his connection

photograph has been a little prominent in the illustrated press lately)
seen sitting next door to the Duchess of Denver at the inquest. His aim
in life was to prevent the two ends of the problem from linking up. And

“A regular pea-souper, by Jove,” said Lord Peter.

“It affords me, if I may say so, the greatest satisfaction,” continued
the noble lord, “that in a collaboration like ours all the uninteresting
and disagreeable routine work is done by you.”

“Do you anticipate any difficulty about the warrant?” inquired Lord
Peter.

Parker grunted a third time.

Parker grunted again.

“Do you anticipate any difficulty about the warrant?” inquired Lord

“I suppose you've seen to it that all this business is kept quiet?”

“Of course.”

“My dear Wimsey, do you think I'm a fool?”

“I had no such hope.”

==> Parker grunted finally and departed. <==

Lord Peter settled down to a perusal of his Dante. It afforded him no
solace. Lord Peter was hampered in his career as a private detective by
a public-school education. Despite Parker's admonitions, he was not
always able to discount it. His mind had been warped in its young growth

stand. He belonged to a family which had never shot a fox.

“I am an amateur,” said Lord Peter.

The vile, raw fog tore your throat and ravaged your eyes. You could not
see your feet. You stumbled in your walk over poor men's graves.

==> The feel of Parker's old trench-coat beneath your fingers was <==
comforting. You had felt it in worse places. You clung on now for fear
you should get separated. The dim people moving in front of you were
like Brocken spectres.

“Take care, gentlemen,” said a toneless voice out of the yellow

You bore away to the right, and floundered in a mass of freshly turned
clay.

“Where is Lady Levy?”

wonderful, Peter.”

“Have you finished?” asked somebody.

“Nearly done, sir.” The demons fell to work again with the
pitchforks—no, spades.

==> Somebody sneezed. Parker located the sneezer and introduced him. <==

“Mr. Levett represents the Home Secretary. Lord Peter Wimsey. We are
sorry to drag you out on such a day, Mr. Levett.”

“It's all in the day's work,” said Mr. Levett, hoarsely. He was muffled

A black-bearded spectre at your elbow. Introduced. The Master of the
Workhouse.

“A very painful matter, Lord Peter. You will forgive me for hoping you
==> and Mr. Parker may be mistaken.” <==

“I should like to be able to hope so, too.”

Something heaving, straining, coming up out of the ground.

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 6474    window = 6469 6479


“Steady, men. This way. Can you see? Be careful of the graves—they lie
pretty thick hereabouts. Are you ready?”

“Right you are, sir. You go on with the lantern. We can follow you.”

More graves. A headstone shouldered crookedly aslant. A trip and jerk
over the edge of the rough grass. The squeal of gravel under your feet.

Levett. It would be better, I think, if you came on this side.
Yes—yes—thank you. That's excellent.”

The sudden brilliant circle of an electric lamp over the table. Dr.
==> Grimbold's beard and spectacles. Mr. Levett blowing his nose. Parker <==
bending close. The Master of the Workhouse peering over him. The rest of
the room in the enhanced dimness of the gas-jets and the fog.

A low murmur of voices. All heads bent over the work.

“No, Duchess, thank you. We are very grateful to you and to Lady Levy

helpful, escorted them to their waiting car. Then Dr. Grimbold again:

“Yes. Well, it doesn't matter. Whoever goes won't get there in time.
Sugg's as good as another.”

But Sugg—an experience rare in his career—was in time.

At this point the manuscript broke off.
