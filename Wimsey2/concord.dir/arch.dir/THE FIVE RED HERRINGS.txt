painters in oils, painters in water-colour, painters in pastel, etchers
and illustrators, workers in metal; artists of every variety, having
this one thing in common--that they take their work seriously and have
no time for amateurs.

==> Into this fishing and painting community, Lord Peter Wimsey was received <==
on friendly and even affectionate terms. He could make a respectable
cast, and he did not pretend to paint, and therefore, though English and
an "in-comer," gave no cause of offence. The Southron is tolerated in
Scotland on the understanding that he does not throw his weight about,
and from this peculiarly English vice Lord Peter was laudably free.

but he had been weighed in the balance over many seasons and pronounced
harmless, and when he indulged in any startling eccentricity, the matter
was dismissed with a shrug and a tolerant, "Christ, it's only his
lordship."

==> Wimsey was in the bar of the McClellan Arms on the evening that the <==
unfortunate dispute broke out between Campbell and Waters. Campbell, the
landscape painter, had had maybe one or two more wee ones than was
absolutely necessary, especially for a man with red hair, and their
effect had been to make him even more militantly Scottish than usual. He
embarked on a long eulogy of what the Jocks had done in the Great War,

but also personally abusive.

"The trouble with you Scotch," said Waters, when Campbell paused to take
breath, "is that you have an inferiority complex."

==> He emptied his glass in a don't-careish manner and smiled at Wimsey. <==

It was probably the smile even more than the sneer which put the final
touch to Campbell's irritation. He used a few brief and regrettable
expressions, and transferred the better part of the contents of his
glass to Waters' countenance.

Campbell as they wrestled together among the broken glass and sawdust.

"I'll break your qualified neck for this," he said savagely, "you dirty
Highland tyke."

==> "Here, chuck it, Waters," said Wimsey, collaring him, "don't be a fool. <==
The fellow's drunk."

"Come away, man," said McAdam, the fisherman, enveloping Campbell in a
pair of brawny arms. "This is no way to behave. Be quiet."

"Come away, man," said McAdam, the fisherman, enveloping Campbell in a
pair of brawny arms. "This is no way to behave. Be quiet."

The combatants fell apart, panting.

==> "This won't do," said Wimsey, "this isn't the League of Nations. A <==
plague on both your houses! Have a bit of sense."

"He called me a ----," muttered Waters, wiping the whiskey from his
face. "I'm damned if I'll stand it. He'd better keep out of my way,
that's all." He glared furiously at Campbell.

"You be damned," said Campbell, "I've got my own car and I can drive it.
And I don't want to see any of the whole blasted lot of ye again."

He plunged out, and there was a pause.

==> "Dear, dear," said Wimsey. <==

"I think I'd best be off out of it too," said Waters, sullenly.

Wimsey and McAdam exchanged glances.

"Dear, dear," said Wimsey.

"I think I'd best be off out of it too," said Waters, sullenly.

==> Wimsey and McAdam exchanged glances. <==

"Bide a bit," said the latter. "There's no need to be in sic a hurry.
Campbell's a hasty man, and when there's a wee bit drink in him he says
mair nor he means."

"Och, that's a'richt," said McAdam. "Ye meant no harm, Mr. Waters.
What'll ye have?"

"Oh, a double Scotch," replied Waters, with rather a shame-faced grin.

==> "That's right," said Wimsey, "drown remembrance of the insult in the <==
wine of the country."

A man named McGeoch, who had held aloof from the disturbance, rose up
and came to the bar.

"I'm not saying it is. But there's some gets into trouble without others
to help them to it."

"I shouldn't have fancied Campbell in the rÃ´le of a home-breaker," said
==> Wimsey, pleasantly. <==

"I shouldn't fancy him at all," growled Waters, "but he fancies himself
quite enough, and one of these days----"

"There, there," said Murdoch, hastily. "It's true he's no a verra

popular man, is Campbell, but it's best to be patient and tak' no notice
of him."

"That's all very well," said Waters.

==> "And wasn't there some sort of row about fishing?" interrupted Wimsey. <==
If the talk had to be about Campbell, it was better to steer it away
from Waters at all costs.

"Och, ay," said McAdam. "Him and Mr. Jock Graham is juist at daggers
drawn aboot it. Mr. Graham will be fishing the pool below Campbell's

"Particularly," said McGeoch, "after Campbell had tried to duck him in
the Fleet."

==> "Did he though, by Jove?" said Wimsey, interested. <==

"Ay, but he got weel duckit himsel'," said Murdoch, savouring the
reminiscence. "And Graham's been fushin' there every nicht since then,
wi' yin or twa of the lads. He'll be there the nicht, I wadna wonder."

"Then if Campbell's spoiling for a row, he'll know where to go for it,"
==> said Wimsey. "Come on, Waters, we'd better make tracks." <==

Waters, still sulky, rose and followed him. Wimsey steered him home to
his lodgings, prattling cheerfully, and tucked him into bed.

"And I shouldn't let Campbell get on your nerves," he said, interrupting

his lodgings, prattling cheerfully, and tucked him into bed.

"And I shouldn't let Campbell get on your nerves," he said, interrupting
a long grumble, "he's not worth it. Go to sleep and forget it, or you'll
do no work to-morrow. That's pretty decent, by the way," he added,

"Oh, he can paint--after a fashion. He's what Gowan calls him--a
commercial traveller. His stuff's damned impressive at first sight, but
it's all tricks. Anybody could do it, given the formula. I could do a
perfectly good Campbell in half an hour. Wait a moment, I'll show you."

==> He thrust out a leg from the bed. Wimsey pushed him firmly back again. <==

"Show me some other time. When I've seen his stuff. I can't tell if the
imitation's good till I've seen the original, can I?"

"No. Well, you go and look at his things and then I'll show you. Oh,

"No. Well, you go and look at his things and then I'll show you. Oh,
Lord, my head's fuzzy like nothing on earth."

==> "Go to sleep," said Wimsey. "Shall I tell Mrs. McLeod to let you sleep <==
in, as they say? And call you with a couple of aspirins on toast?"

"No; I've got to be up early, worse luck. But I shall be all right in
the morning."

"No; I've got to be up early, worse luck. But I shall be all right in

He shut the door after him carefully and wandered thoughtfully back to
his own habitation.

"Did ye hear aboot Mr. Campbell?" said Mr. Murdoch of the McClellan
Arms, polishing a glass carefully as a preparation for filling it with
beer.

"Why, what further trouble has he managed to get into since last night?"
==> asked Wimsey. He leaned an elbow on the bar and prepared to relish <==
anything that might be offered to him.

"He's deid," said Mr. Murdoch.

"Deid?" said Wimsey, startled into unconscious mimicry.

asked Wimsey. He leaned an elbow on the bar and prepared to relish

Mr. Murdoch nodded.

"Och, ay; McAdam's juist brocht the news in from Gatehouse. They found

Mr. Murdoch nodded.

"Och, ay; McAdam's juist brocht the news in from Gatehouse. They found
the body at 2 o'clock up in the hills by Newton-Stewart."

==> "Good heavens!" said Wimsey. "But what did he die of?" <==

"Juist tummled intae the burn," replied Mr. Murdoch, "an' drooned
himself, by what they say. The pollis'll be up there now tae bring him
doon."

It's slippery there and fou o' broken rocks. I'm thinkin' he'll ha'

on the stanes."

==> "He wouldn't want water for oil-paints," said Wimsey, thoughtfully, "but <==
he might have wanted to mix mustard for his sandwiches or fill a kettle
or get a drop for his whiskey. I say, Murdoch, I think I'll just toddle
over there in the car and have a look at him. Corpses are rather in my
line, you know. Where is this place exactly?"

again at the signpost along the road to Bargrennan and juist follow the
road till ye turn over a wee brig on the richt-hand side over the Cree
and then tak' the richt-hand road."

==> "In fact," said Wimsey, "you keep on turning to the right. I think I <==
know the place. There's a bridge and another gate, and a burn with
salmon in it."

"I'll be off then," he said, "I don't want to miss the fun. See you
later, old boy. I say--I don't mind betting this is the most popular
thing Campbell ever did. Nothing in life became him like the leaving it,
eh, what?"

==> It was a marvellous day in late August, and Wimsey's soul purred within <==
him as he pushed the car along. The road from Kirkcudbright to
Newton-Stewart is of a varied loveliness hard to surpass, and with a sky
full of bright sun and rolling cloud-banks, hedges filled with flowers,
a well-made road, a lively engine and the prospect of a good corpse at
the end of it, Lord Peter's cup of happiness was full. He was a man who

[line number in individual story] matching line = 522    window = 517 527

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 47770    window = 47765 47775


to shut out the sunlight. Then a cluster of stone cottages--then the
bridge and the gate, and the stony hill-road, winding between mounds
round as the hill of the King of Elf-land, green with grass and purple
with heather and various with sweeping shadows.

==> Wimsey pulled up as he came to the second bridge and the rusty gate, and <==
drew the car on to the grass. There were other cars there, and glancing
along to the left he saw a little group of men gathered on the edge of
the burn forty or fifty yards from the road. He approached by way of a
little sheep-track, and found himself standing on the edge of a scarp of
granite that shelved steeply down to the noisy waters of the Minnoch.

[line number in individual story] matching line = 533    window = 528 538

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 47781    window = 47776 47786


Beside him, close to the edge of the rock, stood a sketching easel, with
a stool and a palette. Down below, at the edge of a clear brown pool,
fringed with knotted hawthorns, lay something humped and dismal, over
which two or three people were bending.

==> A man, who might have been a crofter, greeted Wimsey with a kind of <==
cautious excitement.

"He's doon there, sir. Ay, he'll juist ha' slippit over the edge. Yon's
Sergeant Dalziel and Constable Ross, mekkin' their investigation the
noo."

[line number in individual story] matching line = 542    window = 537 547

Sergeant Dalziel and Constable Ross, mekkin' their investigation the
noo."

There seemed little doubt how the accident had happened. On the easel
was a painting, half, or more than half finished, the paint still wet
==> and shining. Wimsey could imagine the artist getting up, standing away <==
to view what he had done--stepping farther back towards the treacherous
granite slope. Then the scrape of a heel on the smooth stone, the
desperate effort to recover, the slither of leather on the baked short
grass, the stagger, the fall, and the bump, bump, bump of the tumbling
body, sheer down the stone face of the ravine to where the pointed rocks

desperate effort to recover, the slither of leather on the baked short
grass, the stagger, the fall, and the bump, bump, bump of the tumbling
body, sheer down the stone face of the ravine to where the pointed rocks
grinned like teeth among the chuckling water.

==> "I know the man," said Wimsey. "It's a very nasty thing, isn't it? I <==
think I'll go down and have a look."

"Ye'll mind your footing," said the crofter.

"I certainly will," said Wimsey, clambering crablike among the stones

[line number in individual story] matching line = 555    window = 550 560

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 47803    window = 47798 47808


"I know the man," said Wimsey. "It's a very nasty thing, isn't it? I
think I'll go down and have a look."

"Ye'll mind your footing," said the crofter.

==> "I certainly will," said Wimsey, clambering crablike among the stones <==
and bracken. "I don't want to make another police-exhibit."

The Sergeant looked up at the sound of Wimsey's scrambling approach.
They had met already, and Dalziel was prepared for Wimsey's interest in
corpses, however commonplace the circumstances.

[line number in individual story] matching line = 558    window = 553 563

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 47806    window = 47801 47811

They had met already, and Dalziel was prepared for Wimsey's interest in

"Hech, my lord," said he, cheerfully. "I dooted ye'd be here before
verra long. Ye'll know Dr. Cameron, maybe?"

==> Wimsey shook hands with the doctor--a lanky man with a non-committal <==
face--and asked how they were getting on with the business.

"Och, well, I've examined him," said the doctor. "He's dead beyond a
doubt--been dead some hours, too. The rigor, ye see, is well developed."

I would be inclined to say he got his death in falling or in striking
the stones in the burn. But I cannot make a definite pronouncement, you
understand, till I have had an autopsy and seen if there is any water in
his lungs."

==> "Quite so," said Wimsey. "The bump on the head might only have made him <==
unconscious, and the actual cause of death might be drowning."

"That is so. When we first saw him, he was lying with his mouth under
water, but that might very well come from washing about in the scour of
the burn. There are certain abrasions on the hands and head, some of

It moved all of a piece, crouched and bundled together, as though it had
stiffened in the act of hiding its face from the brutal teeth of the
rocks.

"But here's where he got the big dunt," added the doctor. He guided
==> Wimsey's fingers to Campbell's left temple, and Wimsey felt the bone <==
give under his light pressure.

"Nature has left the brain ill-provided in those parts," remarked Dr.
Cameron. "The skull there is remarkably thin, and a comparatively
trifling blow will crush it like an egg-shell."

"Nature has left the brain ill-provided in those parts," remarked Dr.
Cameron. "The skull there is remarkably thin, and a comparatively
trifling blow will crush it like an egg-shell."

limbs. The doctor watched him with grave approval.

"Man," he said, "ye'd make a fine surgeon. Providence has given ye the
hands for it."

"Man," he said, "ye'd make a fine surgeon. Providence has given ye the
hands for it."

==> "But not the head," said Wimsey, laughing. "Yes, he's got knocked about <==
a bit. I don't wonder, coming down that bank full tilt."

"Ay, it's a dangerous place," said the Sergeant. "Weel, noo, doctor, I'm
thinkin' we've seen a' that's to be seen doon here. We would better be
getting the body up to the car."

can help you with the lifting. I don't want to be in the way."

"Nay, nay," said the Sergeant. "Thank you for the offer, my lord, but we
can manage fine by oorsel's."

"Nay, nay," said the Sergeant. "Thank you for the offer, my lord, but we

==> The Sergeant and a constable bent over and seized the body. Wimsey <==
waited to see that they required no assistance, and then scrambled up to
the top of the bank again.

He gave his first attention to the picture. It was blocked in with a
free and swift hand, and lacked the finishing touches, but it was even

of the tumbling water beneath. Up on the left, the hills soared away in
veil on veil of misty blue to meet the hazy sky. And splashed against
the blue stood the great gold splendour of the bracken, flung in by
spadefuls of pure reds and yellows.

==> Idly, Wimsey picked up the palette and painting-knife which lay upon the <==
stool. He noticed that Campbell used a simple palette of few colours,
and this pleased him, for he liked to see economy of means allied with
richness of result. On the ground was an aged satchel, which had
evidently seen long service. Rather from habit than with any eye to
deduction, he made an inventory of its contents.

thick tumbler and a packet of bread and cheese, eight brushes, tied
together with a dejected piece of linen which had once been a
handkerchief but was now dragging out a dishonoured existence as a
paint-rag, a dozen loose brushes, two more painting-knives and a
scraper. Cheek by jowl with these were a number of tubes of paint.
==> Wimsey laid them out side by side on the granite, like a row of little <==
corpses.

There was a half-pound tube of vermilion spectrum, new, clean and almost
unused, a studio-size tube of ultramarine No. 2, half-full, another of
chrome yellow, nearly full, and another of the same, practically empty.

gone, which seemed to have survived much wear and tear without losing
==> much of its contents. Wimsey removed the cap and diagnosed it as crimson <==
lake. Finally, there was an almost empty studio-size tube of rose madder
and a half-pound lemon yellow, partly used and very dirty.

Wimsey considered this collection for a moment, and then dived
confidently into the satchel again. The large compartment, however,

much of its contents. Wimsey removed the cap and diagnosed it as crimson
lake. Finally, there was an almost empty studio-size tube of rose madder
and a half-pound lemon yellow, partly used and very dirty.

==> Wimsey considered this collection for a moment, and then dived <==
confidently into the satchel again. The large compartment, however,
yielded nothing further except some dried heather, a few shreds of
tobacco and a quantity of crumbs, and he turned his attention to the two
smaller compartments.

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 47927    window = 47922 47932



The third and last compartment of the satchel offered a more varied bag.
There was a Swan vesta box, filled with charcoal, a cigarette-tin, also
containing charcoal and a number of sticks of red chalk, a small
sketch-book, heavily stained with oil, three or four canvas-separators,
==> on which Wimsey promptly pricked his fingers, some wine-corks and a <==
packet of Gold Flakes.

Wimsey's air of idleness had left him. His long and inquisitive nose
seemed to twitch like a rabbit's as he turned the satchel upside down
and shook it, in the vain hope of extracting something more from its

==> Wimsey's air of idleness had left him. His long and inquisitive nose <==
seemed to twitch like a rabbit's as he turned the satchel upside down
and shook it, in the vain hope of extracting something more from its
depths. He rose, and searched the easel and the ground about the stool
very carefully.

irritated him. At a shout from the top of the bank he looked up. The
Sergeant was grinning down at him.

"Reconstructing the accident, my lord?"

==> "Not exactly," said Wimsey. "Here, wait just a moment, will you?" <==

He scrambled up again. The corpse was now laid as decently as possible
on a stretcher, awaiting removal.

"Have you searched his pockets?" panted Wimsey.

"Not exactly," said Wimsey. "Here, wait just a moment, will you?"

He scrambled up again. The corpse was now laid as decently as possible
on a stretcher, awaiting removal.

==> "Have you searched his pockets?" panted Wimsey. <==

"Not yet, my lord. Time enough for that at the station. It's purely a
formality, ye ken."

"No, it's not," said Wimsey. He pushed his hat back and wiped the sweat

"Have you searched his pockets?" panted Wimsey.

"Not yet, my lord. Time enough for that at the station. It's purely a
formality, ye ken."

==> "No, it's not," said Wimsey. He pushed his hat back and wiped the sweat <==
from his forehead. "There's something funny about this, Dalziel. That
is, there may be. Do you mind if I go over his belongings now?"

"Not at all, not at all," said Dalziel, heartily. "There's no sic a
great hurry. We may as weel dew't first as last."

[line number in individual story] matching line = 725    window = 720 730

is, there may be. Do you mind if I go over his belongings now?"

"Not at all, not at all," said Dalziel, heartily. "There's no sic a
great hurry. We may as weel dew't first as last."

==> Wimsey sat down on the ground beside the stretcher, and the Sergeant <==
stood by with a notebook to chronicle the finds.

The right-hand coat pocket contained another handkerchief, a Hardy
catalogue, two crumpled bills and an object which caused the Sergeant to
exclaim laughingly, "What's this, lip-stick?"

[line number in individual story] matching line = 732    window = 727 737

The right-hand coat pocket contained another handkerchief, a Hardy
catalogue, two crumpled bills and an object which caused the Sergeant to
exclaim laughingly, "What's this, lip-stick?"

==> "Nothing so suggestive," said Wimsey, sadly, "it's a holder for <==
lead-pencil--made in Germany, to boot. Still, if that's there, there
might be something else."

The left-hand pocket, however, produced nothing more exciting than a
corkscrew and some dirt; the breast-pocket, only an Ingersoll watch, a

lead-pencil--made in Germany, to boot. Still, if that's there, there
might be something else."

The left-hand pocket, however, produced nothing more exciting than a
corkscrew and some dirt; the breast-pocket, only an Ingersoll watch, a
==> pocket comb and a half-used book of stamps; and Wimsey turned, without <==
much hope, to the trouser-pockets, for the dead man wore no waistcoat.

Here, on the right, they found a quantity of loose cash, the notes and
coins jumbled carelessly together, and a bunch of keys on a ring. On the
left, an empty match-box and a pair of folding nail-scissors. In the

coins jumbled carelessly together, and a bunch of keys on a ring. On the
left, an empty match-box and a pair of folding nail-scissors. In the
hip-pocket, a number of dilapidated letters, some newspaper cuttings and
a small notebook with nothing in it.

==> Wimsey sat up and stared at the Sergeant. <==

"It's not here," he said, "and I don't like the look of it at all,
Dalziel. Look here, there's just one possibility. It may have rolled
down into the water. For God's sake get your people together and hunt
for it--now. Don't lose a minute."

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 48007    window = 48002 48012


Dalziel gazed at this excitable Southerner in some astonishment, and the
constable pushed back his cap and scratched his head.

"What would we be lookin' for?" he demanded, reasonably.

==>               (Here Lord Peter Wimsey told the Sergeant <==
              what he was to look for and why, but as the
              intelligent reader will readily supply these
              details for himself, they are omitted from
              this page.)

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 48017    window = 48012 48022



"It'll be important, then, to your way o' thinking," said Dalziel, with
the air of a man hopefully catching, through a forest of obscurity, the
first, far-off glimmer of the obvious.

==> "Important?" said Wimsey. "Of course it's important. Incredibly, <==
urgently, desperately important. Do you think I should be sliding all
over your infernal granite making a blasted pincushion of myself if it
wasn't important?"

This argument seemed to impress the Sergeant. He called his forces

[line number in individual story] matching line = 776    window = 771 781

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 48024    window = 48019 48029


over your infernal granite making a blasted pincushion of myself if it
wasn't important?"

This argument seemed to impress the Sergeant. He called his forces
together and set them to search the path, the bank and the burn for the
==> missing object. Wimsey, meanwhile, strolled over to a shabby old <==
four-seater Morris, which stood drawn well up on the grass at the
beginning of the sheep-track.

"Ay," said Constable Ross, straightening his back and sucking his
fingers, preliminary to a further hunt among the prickles, "yon's his

[line number in individual story] matching line = 784    window = 779 789

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 48032    window = 48027 48037



"Ay," said Constable Ross, straightening his back and sucking his
fingers, preliminary to a further hunt among the prickles, "yon's his
car. Maybe ye'll find what ye're wantin' in it, after all."

==> "Don't you believe it, laddie," said Wimsey. Nevertheless, he subjected <==
the car to a careful scrutiny, concentrated for the most part upon the
tonneau. A tarry smear on the back cushions seemed to interest him
particularly. He examined it carefully with a lens, whistling gently the
while. Then he searched further and discovered another on the edge of
the body, close to the angle behind the driver's seat. On the floor of

[line number in individual story] matching line = 793    window = 788 798

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 48041    window = 48036 48046


while. Then he searched further and discovered another on the edge of
the body, close to the angle behind the driver's seat. On the floor of
the car lay a rug, folded up. He shook it out and looked it over from
corner to corner. Another patch of grit and tar rewarded him.

==> Wimsey pulled out a pipe and lit it thoughtfully. Then he hunted in the <==
pockets of the car till he found an ordnance map of the district. He
climbed into the driver's seat, spread out the map on the wheel, and
plunged into meditation.

Presently the Sergeant came back, very hot and red in the face, in his

[line number in individual story] matching line = 805    window = 800 810

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 48053    window = 48048 48058



"We've searched high and low," he said, stooping to wring the water from
his trouser-legs, "but we canna find it. Maybe ye'll be tellin' us now
why the thing is so important."

==> "Oh?" said Wimsey. "You look rather warm, Dalziel. I've cooled off <==
nicely, sitting here. It's not there, then?"

"It is not," said the Sergeant, with emphasis.

"In that case," said Wimsey, "you had better go to the coroner--no, of

"Oh?" said Wimsey. "You look rather warm, Dalziel. I've cooled off
nicely, sitting here. It's not there, then?"

"It is not," said the Sergeant, with emphasis.

==> "In that case," said Wimsey, "you had better go to the coroner--no, of <==
course, you don't keep coroners in these parts. The Procurator-Fiscal is
the lad. You'd better go to the Fiscal and tell him the man's been
murdered."

"Murdered?" said the Sergeant.

[line number in individual story] matching line = 817    window = 812 822

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 48065    window = 48060 48070


the lad. You'd better go to the Fiscal and tell him the man's been
murdered."

"Murdered?" said the Sergeant.

==> "Yes," said Wimsey, "och, ay; likewise hoots! Murrrderrrt is the word." <==

"Eh!" said the Sergeant. "Here, Ross!"

The constable came up to them at a slow gallop.


[line number in individual story] matching line = 829    window = 824 834

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 48077    window = 48072 48082


murdered."

"Is he indeed?" said Ross. "Ay, imph'm. And what should bring his
lordship to that conclusion?"

==> "The rigidity of the corpse," said Wimsey, "the fact that you can't find <==
what you're looking for, these smears of tar on the Morris, and the
character of the deceased. He was a man anybody might have felt proud to
murder."

"The rigidity of the corpse, now," said Dalziel. "That'll be a matter

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 48089    window = 48084 48094



"I confess," said the doctor, who had now joined them, "that has been
puzzling me. If the man had not been seen alive just after 10 o'clock
this morning, I would have said he had been nearer twelve hours dead."

==> "So should I," said Wimsey. "On the other hand, you'll notice that that <==
painting, which was put on with a quick-drying copal medium, is still
comparatively wet, in spite of the hot sun and the dry air."

"Ay," said the doctor. "So I am forced to the conclusion that the chill
of the water produced early rigor."

[line number in individual story] matching line = 848    window = 843 853

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 48096    window = 48091 48101


comparatively wet, in spite of the hot sun and the dry air."

"Ay," said the doctor. "So I am forced to the conclusion that the chill
of the water produced early rigor."

==> "I do not submit to force," said Wimsey. "I prefer to believe that the <==
man was killed about midnight. I do not believe in that painting. I do
not think it is telling the truth. I know that it is absolutely
impossible for Campbell to have been working here on that painting this
morning."


[line number in individual story] matching line = 856    window = 851 861

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 48104    window = 48099 48109


impossible for Campbell to have been working here on that painting this
morning."

"Why so?" inquired the Sergeant.

==> "For the reasons I gave you before," said Wimsey. "And there's another <==
small point--not very much in itself, but supporting the same
conclusion. The whole thing looks--and is meant to look--as though
Campbell had got up from his painting, stepped back to get a better view
of his canvas, missed his footing and fallen down. But his palette and
painting-knife were laid down on his stool. Now it's far more likely

[line number in individual story] matching line = 872    window = 867 877

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 48120    window = 48115 48125



"Ay," said Ross. "I've seen 'em dew that. Steppin' back wi' their eyes
half-shut and then hoppin' forward wi' the brush as if they was throwin'
darts."

==> Wimsey nodded. <==

"It's my theory," he said, "that the murderer brought the body here this
morning in Campbell's own car. He was wearing Campbell's soft hat and
that foul plaid cloak of his so that anybody passing by might mistake
him for Campbell. He had the body on the floor of the tonneau and on top

[line number in individual story] matching line = 892    window = 887 897

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 48140    window = 48135 48145


spot, here. A man might easily commit a dozen murders, if he chose his
time well."

"That's a verra interesting theory," said Dalziel.

==> "You can test it," said Wimsey. "If anybody saw Campbell this morning to <==
speak to, or close enough to recognise his face, then, of course, it's a
wash-out. But if they only saw the hat and cloak, and especially if they
noticed anything bulky in the back of the car with a rug over it, then
the theory stands. Mind you, I don't say the bicycle is absolutely
necessary to the theory, but it's what I should have used in the

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 48151    window = 48146 48156


murderer's place. And if you'll look at this smear of tar under the
lens, I think you'll see traces of the tread of a tyre."

"I'll no say ye're no richt," said Dalziel.

==> "Very well," said Wimsey. "Now let's see what our murderer has to do <==
next." He flapped the map impressively, and the two policemen bent their
heads over it with him.

"Here he is," said Wimsey, "with only a bicycle to help or hinder him,
and he's got to establish some sort of an alibi. He may not have

"Very well," said Wimsey. "Now let's see what our murderer has to do
next." He flapped the map impressively, and the two policemen bent their
heads over it with him.

==> "Here he is," said Wimsey, "with only a bicycle to help or hinder him, <==
and he's got to establish some sort of an alibi. He may not have
bothered about anything very complicated, but he'd make haste to
dissociate himself from this place as quickly as possible. And I don't
fancy he'd be anxious to show himself in Newton-Stewart or Creetown.
There's nowhere much for him to go northward--it only takes him up into

The Sergeant glanced at his colleagues and read approval in their eyes.

"And whae d'ye think, my lord, wad be the likeliest pairson to hae
committed the crime?" he inquired.

==> "Well," said Wimsey, "I can think of half a dozen people with perfectly <==
good motives. But the murderer's got to be an artist, and a clever one,
for that painting would have to pass muster as Campbell's work. He must
know how to drive a car, and he must possess, or have access to, a
bicycle. He must be fairly hefty, to have carried the body up here on
his back, for I see no signs of dragging. He must have been in contact

possible I may be able to put my finger on him myself, working on
different lines and with rather less exertion."

"Och, weel," said the Sergeant, "if ye find him, ye'll let us know."

==> "I will," said Wimsey, "though it will be rather unpleasant, because ten <==
to one he'll be some bloke I know and like much better than Campbell.
Still, it doesn't do to murder people, however offensive they may be.
I'll do my best to bring him in captive to my bow and spear--if he
doesn't slay me first."

                                FERGUSON

==> On his way back to Kirkcudbright, it occurred to Wimsey that it was more <==
than time for tea, and further, that it would be a good idea to visit
Campbell's cottage. He accordingly pulled up at the Anwoth Hotel, and,
while voraciously filling himself up with potato-scones and ginger-cake,
made out a rough list of possible suspects.


[line number in individual story] matching line = 1007    window = 1002 1012

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 48255    window = 48250 48260


 child, one servant--portrait painter and illustrator--secretary
 of golf-club--known to have quarrelled with
 Campbell and turned him off the golf-course.

The list had reached this stage when the landlord of the hotel came in.
==> Wimsey gave him the latest news of the Campbell affair, without, <==
however, referring to the murder theory, and remarked that he thought of
running along to Campbell's house, to see if anything was known there
about his movements.

"I doot ye'll no be hearin' much there," said the landlord. "Mrs. Green

that does his work is away home, but she knows juist naething at a',
except that when she arrived this mornin' at 8 o'clock to put the place
in order, he had went oot. And Mr. Ferguson that lives next him was away
to Glasgow by the first train."

==> "Ferguson?" said Wimsey. "I think I've met him. Didn't he do those mural <==
paintings for the town hall at some place or other?"

"Ay, he's a verra gude penter. Ye'll have seen him gaun aboot in his wee
Austin. He has the stujo next to Campbell's every summer."

"No, no, Ferguson and Mrs. Ferguson. But the ither's true, too. He and
Campbell had an awfu' quarrel aboot a bit wall of Ferguson's that
Campbell knocked down wi' his car."

"I wonder if there is a single person in the Stewartry that Campbell
==> didn't have a row with," thought Wimsey, and made an addition to his <==
list:--

6. John Ferguson--about 36--about 5 foot 10
  inches--grass-widower--landscape
and figures--row about a wall.

"By the way," he went on, "is Jock Graham anywhere about?"

"Och, Jock--he's away oot. He didna come hame last nicht at a'. He said
he might be fishin up at Loch Trool."

==> "Oho!" said Wimsey. "Up at Loch Trool, is he? How did he go?" <==

"I couldna say. I think the factor had invitit him. He'll ha' spent last
nicht in Newton-Stewart, maybe, and went up wi' the factor in the
mornin'. Or he will ha' been fishin' the loch all nicht."

mornin'. Or he will ha' been fishin' the loch all nicht."

==> "Will he, though?" said Wimsey. This put a new complexion on the matter. <==
An active man might have driven the body up to the Minnoch and walked
back to Newton-Stewart in time to keep his appointment, if that
appointment was not an early one. But it would have to be, of course,
for a day's fishing, and Jock Graham liked to work by night.

"Will he be back to-night, Joe?"

"I couldna say at all," said the landlord, scattering his hopes at a
blow. "They'll maybe tak' twae nichts if the fishin's gude."

==> "H'm!" said Wimsey. "And very nice, too. Well, I'll be getting on." <==

He paid his bill and came downstairs, accompanied by the landlord.

"How's Andy?" he asked, casually.

"Och, fine," said the other. "He's in a great way, though, to-day. Some
fellow's pinched his push-bike. An' the worst is, he had juist fitted it
wi' new tyres on both wheels."

==> Wimsey, with his thumb on the self-starter, paused, electrified. <==

"How's that?"

"It's his ain fault. He will go leavin' it aboot the place. It'll be
some o' these trampin' fellows that sells carpets, verra like. There's

"This mornin', when he was aff to schule. It's a gude thing it wasna the
motor-bike he's always after me to be givin' him."

==> "I daresay somebody's just borrowed it," said Wimsey. <==

"That's so. It may turn up yet. Well, gude day to your lordship."

Wimsey did not cross the bridge, but turned up the road to the railway
station. He passed the turning on the left leading past Anwoth Old Kirk

"I daresay somebody's just borrowed it," said Wimsey.

"That's so. It may turn up yet. Well, gude day to your lordship."

==> Wimsey did not cross the bridge, but turned up the road to the railway <==
station. He passed the turning on the left leading past Anwoth Old Kirk
to the Creetown road, and followed the course of the Fleet till he came
to a small lane on the right. At the end of this stood two little
detached cottages, side by side, looking over a deep pool--in fact, the
famous disputed pool in which Jock Graham had ducked the deceased

to a small lane on the right. At the end of this stood two little
detached cottages, side by side, looking over a deep pool--in fact, the
famous disputed pool in which Jock Graham had ducked the deceased
Campbell.

==> Under normal circumstances, Wimsey would have expected to find both <==

Campbell's, had been locked--probably by the police. Wimsey peered in
through all the ground-floor windows in turn. Everything seemed peaceful
and in order as the charwoman had left it that morning. There was a
sitting-room of bachelor appearance in front and a kitchen behind--the

famous disputed pool in which Jock Graham had ducked the deceased
Campbell.

Under normal circumstances, Wimsey would have expected to find both
doors confidingly on the latch, but to-day the lower cottage, which was
==> Campbell's, had been locked--probably by the police. Wimsey peered in <==
through all the ground-floor windows in turn. Everything seemed peaceful
and in order as the charwoman had left it that morning. There was a
sitting-room of bachelor appearance in front and a kitchen behind--the
usual but and ben with a bedroom over. In addition, a glass-roofed
studio had been built out beyond the kitchen. At the right-hand side,

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 48361    window = 48356 48366


the shed that had housed the Morris stood empty, a fresh set of
tyre-tracks in the dust showing where the car had been taken out that
morning. Just beyond, a wooden gate led into an untidy little garden.
From the end of the studio a party-wall of rough stone ran down,
separating the yard and garden from those belonging to the other
==> cottage, and Wimsey noticed a breach in the wall and the pile of debris <==
which marked where Campbell had backed injudiciously while turning into
the garage, and given cause for so much unneighbourly feeling.

Ferguson's cottage was the mirror-image of Campbell's, but his garden
was neatly cared-for, and his garage was brand-new and built,

which marked where Campbell had backed injudiciously while turning into
the garage, and given cause for so much unneighbourly feeling.

Ferguson's cottage was the mirror-image of Campbell's, but his garden
was neatly cared-for, and his garage was brand-new and built,
==> regrettably, of corrugated iron. Wimsey pushed open the door and was <==
confronted by a new and shining two-seater of a popular type.

This surprised him for a moment. Ferguson had taken the early train to
Glasgow, and Gatehouse Station is six and a half miles from the town.
Why had Ferguson not taken the car? He could easily have left it at the

[line number in individual story] matching line = 1129    window = 1124 1134

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 48377    window = 48372 48382


Why had Ferguson not taken the car? He could easily have left it at the
station till his return. It appeared to be a new toy; perhaps he had not
cared to leave it in strange hands? Or perhaps he meant to be away a
long time? Or perhaps----?

==> Wimsey lifted the bonnet thoughtfully. Yes, that was the explanation. A <==
gap and some loose connections showed that the magneto had been taken
away. Quite probably Ferguson had carried it off with him to Glasgow for
repairs. How, then, had Ferguson got to the station? A friendly lift?
The 'bus? Or a bicycle? The simplest way was to go and ask. At a small
country station no passenger goes unnoticed, and one might as well make

repairs. How, then, had Ferguson got to the station? A friendly lift?
The 'bus? Or a bicycle? The simplest way was to go and ask. At a small
country station no passenger goes unnoticed, and one might as well make
sure that Ferguson really had travelled by that train.

==> Wimsey closed the bonnet and shut the garage-door carefully after him. <==
The house-door was open and he walked in and glanced round. It was as
neat and non-committal as any house could be. Everything had been swept,
dusted and tidied up by Mrs. Green, including the contents of the
studio; for when the artist is away the charwoman will always play among
the paint-pots, and no amount of remonstrance will prevent it. Wimsey

glanced at some figure-studies piled against the wall, squinnied up his

easel, noted casually that Ferguson got his painting materials from
Roberson's, glanced along a row of detective novels on the sitting-room
bookshelf, and tried the lid of the writing-bureau. It was unlocked, and

easel, noted casually that Ferguson got his painting materials from
Roberson's, glanced along a row of detective novels on the sitting-room
bookshelf, and tried the lid of the writing-bureau. It was unlocked, and
disclosed an orderly row of pigeon-holes, with everything in its place.
==> Wimsey put down Ferguson as a man of an almost morbidly exact mentality. <==
There was nothing here to throw any light on Campbell's death, but he
became all the more anxious to get hold of Ferguson. The way in which
the cottages were built, detached and sharing one common entrance yard,
ensured that everything which was done in the one could be overlooked
from the other. If anything unusual had happened to Campbell the

[line number in individual story] matching line = 1164    window = 1159 1169

lipping by at the bottom of the gardens. If Jock Graham, indeed, had
been fishing Standing-Stone Pool that night--but no! He was supposed to
have gone to Loch Trool. Ferguson was the man. It would be advisable to
get quickly upon the track of Ferguson.

==> Wimsey went back to his car and started away up the long hill road to <==
Gatehouse Station, which lies at the edge of the Galloway hill-country,
looking away over the Fleet Valley and the viaduct and frowned on by the
lofty scarp of the Clints of Dromore.

The railway-station at Gatehouse is approached by one of those gates so
numerous in the Border Country, which provide some slight restraint upon
straying cattle but to the impatient motorist appear an unmitigated
nuisance. As usual, however, at this point, an obliging old gentleman
==> emerged from the little group of cottages by the wayside and let Wimsey <==
through.

Immediately beyond the gate, the road branches right and left into a
rough, stony track, of which the left-hand side goes deviously down to
Creetown, while the right-hand side wanders away to Dromore and ends

Immediately beyond the gate, the road branches right and left into a
rough, stony track, of which the left-hand side goes deviously down to
Creetown, while the right-hand side wanders away to Dromore and ends
==> abruptly at the railway viaduct. Wimsey crossed this road and kept <==
straight on down a steep little approach, heavily masked by
rhododendrons, which brought him to the station.

went away this morning by the 9.8. Is that so?"

"Ay, that is so. I saw him mysel'."

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 48456    window = 48451 48461



The booking-clerk, who shared the station-master's office, remembered
Mr. Ferguson very well, because he had taken a first-class return to
Glasgow, an extravagance somewhat unusual among the artist community.

==> "But of course," said Wimsey, "the ticket is available for three months. <==
He's not bound to return to-day. Did he leave his car here, I wonder?"

"He didna come by car," said the clerk. "He tell't me the magneto was
broken down, and he was obliged to take the train from here, instead o'
drivin' to Dumfries."

"Nay," said the station-master, "he'll have come with Campbell's 'bus.
He arrived aboot that time, did he no, Angus?"

"He did that. He was talkin' with Rabbie McHardy when he came in. He'll

He arrived aboot that time, did he no, Angus?"

"He did that. He was talkin' with Rabbie McHardy when he came in. He'll
maybe have told him how long he thocht to be stayin' in Glasgow."

==> "Thanks," said Wimsey. "I'll have a word with Rabbie. I wanted to <==
charter a boat for to-morrow, but if Ferguson isn't going to be back,
it's not much use, is it?"

He chatted for a few minutes more, giving them a suitably censored
account of the Campbell affair, and then took his leave. He had not got

Ferguson from his list of suspects. He would have to check him up, of
course, and see that he really had arrived in Glasgow. This might
present a little difficulty, but it was merely routine-work for Dalziel
and his myrmidons.

==> Wimsey looked at his watch. Jock Graham was at present the most <==
promising candidate for criminal honours, but since he had disappeared,
there was nothing to be done about him for the present. There was,
however, still time to go and interview Strachan, and so round off his
inquiries in Gatehouse.

His lordship stepped accordingly into the sitting-room, where he found
Mrs. Strachan seated by the window instructing her small daughter Myra
in the art of plain knitting.

==> Wimsey apologised for calling just before dinner, and explained that he <==
wanted to fix up with Strachan about a foursome.

"Well, I don't quite know," said Mrs. Strachan, a trifle doubtfully. "I
don't think Harry is likely to be playing for a day or two. He's had

He said something vague about not wanting to be a nuisance.

you. And what have you been doing with yourself this beautiful day?"

"The body?" cried Mrs. Strachan, with a little squeal. "How dreadful
that sounds! What _do_ you mean? A salmon, or something?"

"No, no," said Wimsey. "Campbell--Sandy Campbell--haven't you heard?"

Mrs. Strachan shrieked a third time, more loudly.

"Of course I don't mean that, Harry. How absurd and how horrible! He
fell down and cut his head open and got drowned."

"What's all this about, Wimsey?"

pains."

"Yes, making a sketch or something. You remember, Milly, just on the

Strachan had the grace to mutter that he _was_ sorry, and that he never
wished any harm to the fellow. He leaned his forehead on his hand, as if
his head was aching badly.

Mrs. Strachan gave another small squeak of surprise.

"Oh!" she said, and then subsided swiftly as Strachan turned his
parti-coloured eyes warningly upon her.

"Haven't the faintest idea," replied Strachan, carelessly. "I was
completely knocked out for the moment, and when I pulled myself together
again and went to spy out the land, I only saw a party of men making off
in the distance. I felt too rotten to bother about it, I simply made

in the distance. I felt too rotten to bother about it, I simply made
tracks for the club-house and a drink. I've got the ball, though--a
Silver King. If anybody comes to claim it I shall tell him where he gets
off."

==> "It's a nasty knock," said Wimsey, sympathetically. "A beautiful <==
specimen of its kind, but uncommonly painful, I expect. It's come up
nicely, hasn't it? When exactly did you get it?"

"Oh, quite early," said Strachan. "About 9 o'clock, I should think. I
went and lay down in my room at the club-house all morning, I felt so

Campbell. Dash it all, this means a funeral, I suppose. It's a bit
awkward. In the ordinary way we should send a wreath from the Club, but
I don't quite know what to do under the circumstances, because last time
he was here I told him to send in his resignation."

==> "It's a nice little problem," said Wimsey. "But I think I should send <==
one, all the same. Shows a forgiving spirit and all that. Keep your
vindictiveness for the person who damaged your face. Whom were you
playing with, by the way? Couldn't he have identified the assassin?"

Strachan shook his head.

me, but I don't suppose you'll, so to speak, feel that your eye is in
just yet awhile?"

"Hardly," said Strachan, with a grim smile.

Strachan. Cheerio, old man. Don't bother to see me off the premises. I
know my way out."

Strachan, however, insisted on accompanying him as far as the gate.

tree-hung rise by Cally Lodge and sailed like an aeroplane into the open
country.

"That's a fine black eye your Dad's got," he remarked.

casual visitor with West End ceremony.

As he clattered down the close, picking his way past the conglomeration

efficient person waiting upon the doorstep with an expression which,
though strictly controlled, might almost have been called eager.

dignity. "I inspected the carcase and ascertained that the correct cut
was removed from it."

a chin-wag with Miss Selby till dinner-time."

"Pardon me, my lord. I understand that the ladies have gone away."

that they had gone away to Glasgow."

it does down South, that they have packed up bag and baggage and
departed on a long visit. Well, I'll go and hunt up Mr. Waters. I rather

early activity might have something a little sinister about it. But,
chaperoned by Miss Selby and Miss Cochran, Waters could scarcely have
got into mischief. One more of his six suspects seemed to be safely
eliminated. He left a message that he would like to see Mr. Waters as
soon as he got back and returned to Blue Gate Close.

He had finished his savoury stew, and was enjoying an admirable cheese

over the cobbles, followed by that of a voice inquiring for his

"Yes, my lord." The Sergeant shouldered his way through the narrow

explains why he waited for that train. That's the one that makes the
connection with the boat to Larne. It's a rotten connection at
that--over three hours to wait in Stranraer--but it's apparently the

and he was wearin' big glasses wi' they tinted lenses."

"Ay, I'm thinkin' he wad. He said the gentleman spoke like an
Englishman."

spoke standard public-school English. Strachan, though a Scot,
habitually spoke with an English accent, having been educated at Harrow
and Cambridge. He, however, was a noticeably tall man. It could hardly
be he. Gowan was double-tongued; he spoke English with Wimsey and the
broadest Scots with the natives--but then, Gowan's grand silky beard

too--the wide, ridgy shoulders, tumbling fair hair and queer, light
eyes, temperish, pouted mouth and heavy jaw. Ferguson, too, was Scottish
in accent, though not in idiom, and in feature might be almost anything.

"Did the gentleman give any particular account of himself?" asked
==> Wimsey, coming rather suddenly out of his abstraction. <==

"No, he only got tae the station as the train was standin' at the
platform, but he said somethin' aboot startin' late fra' Ballantrae. He
tuk his ticket for Ayr and the machine was labelled according."

The Sergeant peered thoughtfully at the list, and so did Sir Maxwell.
The latter's jurisdiction extended over both Kirkcudbrightshire and
Wigtownshire, and he knew all the artists more or less well, though not
with any great intimacy, his own interests being military and sporting.

==> "Now," said Wimsey, "two of these people have alibis. Ferguson was duly <==
seen on to the 9.8 from Gatehouse. He had no bicycle with him, and he
booked to Glasgow. There's a picture exhibition on there, and no doubt
that's what he was making for. Waters also departed for Glasgow by the
8.45 from Kirkcudbright, in company with Miss Selby and Miss Cochran. If
they all met at the show they will prove each other's alibis all right.

                 *        *        *        *        *

==> After the Sergeant and his companion had gone, Wimsey remained smoking <==
thoughtfully for some time. He was worried about Waters. He had left him
the night before in a dangerous mood. The last train from Glasgow got in
to Kirkcudbright at 9.00. If Waters had really gone to see the
Exhibition, it was not reasonable to expect him back that night. He
would only have got in to Glasgow at 2.16, and would have had to leave

[line number in individual story] matching line = 1908    window = 1903 1913

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 49156    window = 49151 49161


would only have got in to Glasgow at 2.16, and would have had to leave
again at 5.30. Nobody would go all that way in order to spend a bare
three hours in the town. Except, possibly, to establish an alibi. Could
one establish an alibi that way?

==> Wimsey turned to the time-table again. Kirkcudbright depart 8.45. That <==
was capable of proof by witnesses. Tarff 8.53, Brig-of-Dee 9.2--nothing
to be done from there, except by car. Castle-Douglas 9.7. That was
different. Castle-Douglas was a junction. From there one might turn back
in the direction of Newton-Stewart. Yes. There was a train. This was
ridiculous, of course, because Waters had travelled with the two women,

to be done from there, except by car. Castle-Douglas 9.7. That was
different. Castle-Douglas was a junction. From there one might turn back
in the direction of Newton-Stewart. Yes. There was a train. This was
ridiculous, of course, because Waters had travelled with the two women,
but there was no harm in working it out. Castle-Douglas 9.14,
==> Newton-Stewart 10.22. Wimsey breathed a sigh of relief. If the murderer <==
had been seen painting at 10 o'clock, that let out Waters. He could not
have got even so far as Newton-Stewart by that time.

But all this depended on the doctor's report. If both Wimsey and he had
been mistaken about the rigor--then it was possible that Campbell

have got even so far as Newton-Stewart by that time.

But all this depended on the doctor's report. If both Wimsey and he had
been mistaken about the rigor--then it was possible that Campbell
himself had been painting at the Minnoch till five minutes past eleven.

In which case a train reaching Newton-Stewart at 10.22 might prove very

districts people know one another, and indeed, who would hire out a
driverless car to a man he did not know, without making careful
inquiries? Yet, if the deposit were big enough, he might take the risk.
It would not do to cross Waters off the list too promptly.

==> At this point Wimsey cursed himself for a fool. It was as certain as <==
anything could be that Waters had travelled peacefully to Glasgow under
the eyes of his friends, and would return peacefully with them the next
day.

He looked at his watch. It was not possible, of course, that Waters had

Waters' studio--a big converted barn up a turning off the Tongland Road.
If he had come back, he certainly would not be working there at this
hour. Still, when one is restless, any excuse will serve to take a
little walk.

==> Wimsey made his way past the Castle, up the little flight of steps and <==
over the green by the harbour. The tide was dropping, and the long
mud-flats of the estuary glimmered faintly in the pale midsummer night.
The yacht that had come in that morning still lay close against the
harbour wall, her spars and rigging making a bold foreground of
interlaced verticals and horizontals against the galumphing curves of

congregate by day, plunged down the little alley by the gasworks and
came out past the station on to the Tongland Road.

Crossing the street, he turned off again to the right and found himself
in a happy backwater, with an ancient overshot water-mill, a few

was locked, and there was no sign of life about the place. The silence
was intense. He heard some small animal move in the grass, the plop,
plopping from the wooden trough over the paddles of the mill-wheel; far
off, somewhere in the town, a dog barked hoarsely.

==> Wimsey turned to go. As he went, the stony path creaking under his feet, <==
the door of one of the cottages was flung suddenly open, letting a long
bar of light stream suddenly across the ground. Framed in the door he
saw the silhouette of a woman peering out anxiously into the silvery
darkness.

laid a hand on the woman's shoulder and drew her in, shutting the door.

Sir Maxwell Jamieson was not a man to rush into precipitate action.
Sound and cautious, with a reputation for taciturnity, he preferred to
know exactly where he stood before committing himself to stirring up

palpitating on his doorstep the next morning, shortly after breakfast,
when he himself had barely had time to read the paper.

He was too wise to ignore Wimsey and his theories. He knew that Lord
Peter had an uncanny nose for a crime, and that his help was valuable,

But Sir Maxwell was not yet perfectly convinced that there was any
murder to be investigated. All this talk about missing objects and

[line number in individual story] matching line = 2023    window = 2018 2028

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 49271    window = 49266 49276


theory would collapse. Certainly, there was that awkward point about the
rigor, but Sir Maxwell, turning over the pages of Taylor and Glaister,
felt convinced that it was not possible to lay down any very exact or
reliable laws about the onset of rigor.

==> He frowned over Wimsey's list of suspects--a disagreeable document, he <==
thought, and savouring strongly of the libellous. All these people were
highly respected citizens. Take Gowan, for instance--a leading
inhabitant of Kirkcudbright for over fifteen years, well known and well
liked, in spite of his small vanities and somewhat overbearing manner.
He was wealthy, kept a good house, with an English butler and

irritate his neighbours by his South-country mannerisms. It was
unfortunate that he should have fallen out with Campbell, but surely he
was not the man to harbour murderous resentment for a hasty word spoken
over a drink. And Farren----

==> Sir Maxwell paused there, in justice to Wimsey. Where women were <==
concerned, you never knew. Campbell had been rather a frequent visitor
at the cottage by the old mill. It was said--there had been
talk--threats had been uttered. If there was anything in it, there might
be some difficulty in getting at the truth here. Farren's suspicions had
probably been quite unfounded, for one could hardly look at Mrs. Farren

disadvantage, but he noted it, in his upright Presbyterian mind, as a
discreditable fact. Strachan--well, Strachan was secretary of the
golf-club and weel-respectit. Surely Strachan, like Gowan, could be
ruled out.

==> The telephone rang. Wimsey pricked up his ears. Sir Maxwell raised the <==
receiver with irritating deliberation. He spoke; then turned to Wimsey.

"It's Dalziel. You had better listen in on the extension."

"Is't you, Sir Maxwell? ... Ay, we have the doctor's report.... Ay, it

nine o'clock. And a verra suspeecious an' corroboratin' circumstance is
that the man had nae food in his wame at a'. He was kilt before he had
ta'en ony breakfast."

==> "But," said Wimsey, cutting in on the conversation, "if he had had his <==
breakfast early, it might have passed out of the stomach before
lunch-time."

"Ay, that's so. But it wadna ha' passed oot o' him a'tegither. The

"Ay, that's so. That's his lordship speakin', is't no? Your lordship
will be gratified by this support for our theory."

again later, Sir Maxwell."

==> The Chief Constable hung up the receiver, and confronted Wimsey with a <==
dour smile.

"It certainly looks as though you were right," he admitted reluctantly.
"But," he added, more cheerfully, "now that they've traced the man at
Stranraer, it will probably all be cleared up this morning."

accident up so cleverly would be fool enough to give himself away by
making a belated bolt to Ireland. Don't you?"

"That's a fact," said Jamieson. "If he'd wanted to escape he could have
taken yesterday morning's boat. And if he wanted to play the innocent,

"That's a fact," said Jamieson. "If he'd wanted to escape he could have
taken yesterday morning's boat. And if he wanted to play the innocent,
he could do it better at home."

==> "H'm!" said Wimsey. "I think, you know, the time has come to talk of <==
many things with Farren and Gowan and Waters--only he's
disappeared--and, in fact, with all the good people of Kirkcudbright. A
little tactful gossip, Sir Maxwell, by a cheerful, friendly, inquisitive
bloke like myself, may do wonders in a crisis. Nothing unusual in my
making my morning round of the studios, is there? Nobody minds me. Why,

you?"

"There may be something in what you say," agreed Jamieson, "but you'll
be discreet, mind. There's no need to mention the word murder."

==> "None whatever," said Wimsey. "I'll let them mention it first. Well, <==
toodle-oo!"

Wimsey may not have been an awe-inspiring person to look at, but his
reception at Farren's house did not altogether justify his boast that
"nobody marked him." The door was opened by Mrs. Farren who, at sight of

of surprise but sounded more like alarm.

reception at Farren's house did not altogether justify his boast that

you, Mrs. Farren? Haven't seen you for an age--well, since Friday night
at Bobbie's, but it seems like an age. Is everything bright and
blooming? Where's Farren?"

Mrs. Farren, looking like a ghost painted by Burne-Jones in one of his

Mrs. Farren, looking like a ghost painted by Burne-Jones in one of his
most pre-Raphaelite moments, extended a chill hand.

"I'm very well, thank you. Hugh's out. Er--won't you come in?"

==> Wimsey, who was already in, received this invitation in his heartiest <==
manner.

"Well--that's very good of you. Sure I'm not in the way? I expect you're
cooking or something, aren't you?"


[line number in individual story] matching line = 2208    window = 2203 2213

of thing. You promised one day to let me have a twirl at the wheel."

"I'm afraid I'm being lazy to-day," said Mrs. Farren, with a faint
smile. "I was just--I was only--excuse me one moment."

==> She went out, and Wimsey heard her speaking to somebody at the back of <==
the house--the girl, no doubt, who came in to do the rough work. He
glanced round the room, and his quick eye noted its curiously forlorn
appearance. It was not untidy, exactly; it told no open tale of tumult;
but the cushions were crushed, a flower or two here and there was
wilted; there was a slight film of dust on the window-sill and on the

[line number in individual story] matching line = 2219    window = 2214 2224

polished table. In the houses of some of his friends this might have
meant mere carelessness and a mind above trifles like dust and disorder,
but with Mrs. Farren it was a phenomenon full of meaning. To her, the
beauty of an ordered life was more than a mere phrase; it was a dogma to
be preached, a cult to be practised with passion and concentration.
==> Wimsey, who was imaginative, saw in those faint traces the witness to a <==
night of suspense, a morning of terror; he remembered the anxious figure
at the door, and the man--yes. There had been a man there, too. And
Farren was away. And Mrs. Farren was a very beautiful woman, if you
liked that style of thing, with her oval face and large grey eyes and
those thick masses of copper-coloured hair, parted in the middle and

A step passed the window--Jeanie, with a basket on her arm. Mrs. Farren
came back and sat down in a high, narrow-backed chair, looking out and
past him like a distressed beggar-maid beginning to wonder whether
Cophetua was not something of a trial in family life.

==> "And where," said Wimsey, with obtuse tactlessness, "has Farren <==
disappeared to?"

The large eyes shadowed suddenly with fear or pain.

"He's gone out--somewhere."

The large eyes shadowed suddenly with fear or pain.

"He's gone out--somewhere."

==> "The gay dog," said Wimsey. "Or is he working?" <==

"I--don't quite know." Mrs. Farren laughed. "You know what this place
is. People go off, saying they'll be back to dinner, and then they meet
a man, or somebody says the fish are rising somewhere, and that's the
last you see of them."

didn't even come home to his grub?"

"Oh--I was only speaking generally. He was home to dinner all right."

"And then barged out afterwards, saying he wanted some Gold Flakes and

with some dreadful story about his being killed. But she gets so
excited, and talks such broad Scotch that I really couldn't make it
out."

in the Minnoch yesterday afternoon, with his head bashed in."

"With his head bashed in? You don't mean----"

"Well, it's difficult to say quite how it happened. The river is full of

"It looks like it. He was in the water. But he wasn't drowned, the
doctor says. It was the blow on the head that did it."

"How dreadful!"

==> "I wonder you hadn't heard about it before," said Wimsey. "He was a <==
great friend of yours, wasn't he?"

"Well--yes--we knew him very well." She stopped, and Wimsey thought she
was going to faint. He sprang up.

"No--no----" She flung out a hand to restrain him, but he had already
darted across the passage into the studio, where he remembered to have
seen a tap and a sink. The first thing he noticed there was Farren's
sketching-box, standing open on the table, the paints scattered about
and the palette flung down higgledy-piggledy among them. An old
==> painting-coat hung behind the door, and Wimsey inspected it inside and <==
out with some care, but seemed to find nothing in it worthy of
attention. He filled a cup at the tap, with his eyes roving about the
room. The studio-easel stood in its place with a half-finished canvas
upon it. The small sketching-easel was propped against the sink,
strapped up. Farren had not gone out to paint, evidently.

He returned to the sitting-room. Mrs. Farren waved the cup impatiently
aside.

"Thank you--I don't need it. I told you I didn't. I'm quite all right."
==> Her worried and sleepless eyes belied her. Wimsey felt that he was being <==
a brute, but somebody would be asking questions soon enough. As well he
as the police, he thought.

"Your husband ought to be here soon," he said. "The news will be all
over the country by now. It's surprising, really, he hasn't got back

"Oh," she said, "Hugh and I understood one another." Wimsey nodded. She
was lying, he thought. Farren's objections to Campbell had been
notorious. But she was the kind of woman who, if once she set out to
radiate sweetness and light, would be obstinate in her mission. He

"Oh, yes, he's got his bicycle with him."

"I think there are more bicycles per head of the population in

                              CHAPTER VII


                                 GRAHAM

==> Lord Peter Wimsey, having rendered first aid to Mrs. Farren, left her <==
comfortably reclining on the couch in the sitting-room and went in
search of Jeanie. He discovered her in the fishmonger's and dispatched
her home with the tidings that her mistress was unwell.

"Ay," said Jeanie, philosophically, "I'm no surprised. She's troubled in

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 49656    window = 49651 49661


"Ay," said Jeanie, philosophically, "I'm no surprised. She's troubled in
her mind aboot Mr. Farren. And nae wonder, wi' him mekkin' a' that
disturbance and gaein' aff that gate an' never comin' back for twa
nichts."

==> "Two nights?" said Wimsey. <==

"Ay. Nicht before last it was he went aff on his bicycle, swearin'
somethin' awfu' an' nae ward tae say whaur he was gaein' nor what he was
gaein' to du."

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 49673    window = 49668 49678


gaes and away, wi' Mistress Farren runnin' oot o' the door after him wi'
the tears fallin' doon her cheeks. I dinna ken for why she takes on so
aboot the man. I'd let him gae an' be daumed tae him, wi' his jealousies
an' his tempers."

==> Wimsey began to see why Jeanie had been sent out on an errand in such a <==
hurry. It was foolish, though, for nobody could expect the girl to hold
her tongue over so fine a piece of gossip. Sooner or later, the tale
would have come out to somebody. Even now he observed that curious
glances were following them down the street.

happen.

That was Monday and this was Wednesday; and on the Tuesday, Campbell had
been found dead up at the Minnoch.

==> Wimsey said good-bye to Jeanie, with a caution against talking too much <==
about her employers' affairs, and turned in the direction of the
police-station. Then he changed his mind. No need to make trouble before
it was wanted. There might be other developments. It would not be a bad
idea to run over to Gatehouse. There was a question he wanted to ask
Mrs. Green who did the charing for Campbell. Also, something might have

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 49711    window = 49706 49716


Passing over the bridge at Gatehouse, with these intentions, he was
arrested by the sight of a tall man standing outside the Anwoth Hotel in
conference with the local constable. The man, who was very shabbily
dressed in an ancient burberry, dilapidated plus-fours, disreputable
boots and leggings and a knapsack, waved a hand in violent greeting.
==> Wimsey pulled up with reckless haste, nearly slaying the hotel cat, and <==
waved violently back.

"Hullo--ullo--ullo!" he cried. "Where d'you spring from, you old
ruffian?"

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 49722    window = 49717 49727


"That's just what everybody seems anxious to know," said the untidy man,
extending a large, raw-boned hand. "I don't seem to be allowed to go
away on a little private matter without a hue and cry. What's it all
about?"

==> Wimsey glanced at the constable, who shook his head mysteriously. <==

"Having received orders," he began, "to make an inquiry----"

"But you haven't received orders to make a mystery, have you?" said the
untidy man. "What's the matter? Am I supposed to have committed a crime?

to know----"

"Not guilty this time," said Mr. Graham, promptly. "And in any case
borrowing isn't stealing, you know."

==> "Have you been borrowing push-bikes?" asked Wimsey, with interest. "You <==
shouldn't. It's a bad habit. Push-bikes are the curse of this country.
Their centre of gravity is too high, for one thing, and their brakes are
never in order."

"I know," said Mr. Graham, "it's shameful. Every bicycle I borrow is

wad tell me----"

"Damn it!" said Jock Graham. "No, I will not tell you where I've been.
Why should I?"

==> "Well, it's like this, old dear," said Wimsey. "You may possibly have <==
heard in your mysterious retreat, that Campbell was found dead in a
river yesterday afternoon."

"Campbell? Good Lord! No, I hadn't heard. Well, well, well. I hope his
sins are forgiven him. What had he done? Taken too many wee halves and

the repose of his soul. He wasn't a man I liked, but I'm sorry in a way
to think I'll never pull his leg again. You'll join us, officer?"

"Thank you, sir, but if ye'd kindly----"

==> "Leave it to me," murmured Wimsey, jogging the constable's elbow and <==
following Graham into the bar.

"How have you managed not to hear about it, Jock?" he went on, when the
drinks had been served. "Where have you been hiding the last two days?"


[line number in individual story] matching line = 2549    window = 2544 2554

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 49797    window = 49792 49802



"That's telling. You're as inquisitive as our friend here. I've been
living a retired life--no scandal--no newspapers. But do tell me about
Campbell. When did all this happen?"

==> "They found the body about 2 o'clock," said Wimsey. "He seems to have <==
been seen alive and painting at five past eleven."

"They didn't lose much time about it, then. You know, I've often thought
that one might have an accident up in the hills about here and be lost
for weeks. Still, it's a fairly well-frequented spot up there at the

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 49832    window = 49827 49837


"He does mean it," said Graham. "I read it in his expressive eye. Here's
a nice thing to happen in a quiet country spot."

"It's a terrible thing," said the landlord.

==> "Come now, Jock," said Wimsey. "Put us out of our misery. You can see <==
the suspense is telling on us. How _did_ you know Campbell was up at the
Minnoch?"

"Telepathy," said Graham, with a wide grin. "I look into your minds and
the picture comes before me--the burn full of sharp stones--the steep

bar counter, his face screwed up into a lifelike imitation of Campbell's
heavy jowl and puffed lips, and his hand roughing in outlines with
Campbell's quick, tricky touch. The picture came up before their eyes
with the conjuring quickness of a lightning-sketch at the cinema--the
burn, the trees, the bridge and a mass of bulging white cloud, so like
==> the actual canvas Wimsey had seen on the easel that he was thoroughly <==
startled.

"You ought to be making a living by impersonations, Jock."

"That's my trouble. Too versatile. Paint in everybody's style except my

foreshortened at the bottom, to show that he can do it. Bless you"--he
slopped some beer on the counter and wiped the mess away with a ragged
sleeve--"the whole bunch of them have only got one gift between them
that I lack, and that's the single eye, more's the pity. They're
perfectly sincere, I'm not--that's what makes the difference. I tell
==> you, Wimsey, half those damned portraits people pay me for are <==
caricatures--only the fools don't know it. If they did, they'd rather
die than sign the cheques."

Wimsey laughed. If Graham was playing for time, he was doing it well. If
he was trying to avert suspicion from his dangerous gift of imitation,

[line number in individual story] matching line = 2645    window = 2640 2650

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 49893    window = 49888 49898


perfectly sincere, I'm not--that's what makes the difference. I tell
you, Wimsey, half those damned portraits people pay me for are
caricatures--only the fools don't know it. If they did, they'd rather
die than sign the cheques."

==> Wimsey laughed. If Graham was playing for time, he was doing it well. If <==
he was trying to avert suspicion from his dangerous gift of imitation,
his air of careless frankness could not possibly be better done. And his
explanation was plausible enough--why, indeed, should Campbell not have
mentioned where he was going--to Graham or to anyone?

"As a matter of routine," he murmured.

"Oh!" said Mr. Graham. "This lad's one of the bulldog breed."

==> "Obviously," said Wimsey, "like St. Gengulphus. They cried out, 'Good <==
gracious! How very tenacious!' It's no good, old man. He means to have
his answer."

"Poor fellow!" said Graham. "Want must be his master, as nurses said in
the good old days before Montessori was heard of. I was not up at the

"I understand," said the constable, "that ye refuse cateegoorically tae
state whaur ye were on last Monday nicht."

"Got it at last!" cried Graham. "We're slow but sure in this country,
==> Wimsey. That's right. I refuse categorically, absolutely, _in toto_ and <==
entirely. Make a note of it in case you forget it."

The constable did so with great solemnity.

"Ah, weel," he said, "I'll hae tae be reportin' this tae the

The constable shook his head doubtfully and departed with slow
reluctance.

"Poor devil!" said Graham. "It's a shame to tease him. Have another,
==> Wimsey?" <==

Wimsey declined, and Graham took himself off rather abruptly, saying
that he must go down and see to things at his studio.

The landlord of the Anwoth followed him with his eyes.

[line number in individual story] matching line = 2695    window = 2690 2700

reluctance.

"Poor devil!" said Graham. "It's a shame to tease him. Have another,
Wimsey?"

==> Wimsey declined, and Graham took himself off rather abruptly, saying <==
that he must go down and see to things at his studio.

The landlord of the Anwoth followed him with his eyes.

"What's behind that?" said Wimsey, carelessly.

The landlord of the Anwoth followed him with his eyes.

"Och, it will be some tale or anither," replied the landlord. "He's a
perfect gentleman, is Graham, and a great lad for the leddies."

"Quite so," said Wimsey. "And that reminds me, Rob, I've got a new

perfect gentleman, is Graham, and a great lad for the leddies."

==> "Quite so," said Wimsey. "And that reminds me, Rob, I've got a new <==
limerick for you."

"Have ye noo?" said the landlord, and carefully closed the door between
the inn-parlour and the bar.


[line number in individual story] matching line = 2711    window = 2706 2716

limerick for you."

"Have ye noo?" said the landlord, and carefully closed the door between
the inn-parlour and the bar.

==> Having delivered himself of his limerick and taken his leave, Wimsey <==
turned his attention again to business. Mrs. Green, the charwoman, lived
in a small cottage at no great distance. She was making bannocks when
Wimsey arrived, but having dusted the flour from her hands and
transferred the bannocks to the girdle, was willing enough to talk about
the sudden death of her gentleman.

[line number in individual story] matching line = 2714    window = 2709 2719

transferred the bannocks to the girdle, was willing enough to talk about
the sudden death of her gentleman.

Her Scots was broad and her manner excitable, but after putting his
==> questions two or three times, Wimsey succeeded in understanding her <==
replies.

"Did Mr. Campbell take any breakfast before he went out on Monday
morning?"


[line number in individual story] matching line = 2744    window = 2739 2749

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 49992    window = 49987 49997


had herself brought in a pair of kippers for him on Saturday, and he had
had the one on Sunday morning and the other on Monday morning. There had
been nothing unusual about either cottage, that she could see, and so
she had told the policeman when he called upon her.

==> Wimsey turned these matters over in his mind as he ran back to <==
Kirkcudbright. The doctor's report made those two eggs and rashers a
suspicious circumstance. Somebody had breakfasted in Campbell's cottage,
and the person who could do that most easily was Ferguson.
Alternatively, if it was not Ferguson, Ferguson might have seen whoever
it was. Tiresome of Ferguson to have gone off to Glasgow like that.

impossible to keep one's movements altogether secret. Somebody would
have seen Graham--that is, if somebody chose to speak. But that was as
doubtful as everything else about the case, for your country-dweller is
a master of pregnant silences.

==> Wimsey called at Sir Maxwell Jamieson's to make his report about the <==
eggs and bacon, which was received with an "Ay, imph'm" of the driest
kind. There had been no further news from Dalziel, and he went home,
first calling across the way, only to ascertain that Waters had not yet
returned.

be merely the discovery that the Scotch were so lost to all sense of
propriety as to call a dish an "ashet"--obviously with the deliberate
intention of confusing foreigners and making them feel like bulls in
china-shops.

==> Wimsey sympathised and, to take Bunter's mind off this mortifying <==
experience, mentioned his meeting with Jock Graham.

"Indeed, my lord? I was already apprised of Mr. Graham's reappearance. I
understand, my lord, that he was in Creetown on Monday night."


[line number in individual story] matching line = 2824    window = 2819 2829

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 50072    window = 50067 50077



"No, my lord, but, from the circumstance that they alluded to the number
of drinks he consumed, I apprehend that it would be before
closing-time."

==> "Ah!" said Wimsey. "An inquiry among the Creetown pubs might settle <==
that. Very well, Bunter. I think I shall go out and clear my wits with a
round of golf this afternoon. And I'll have a grilled steak and chips at
7.30."

"Very good, my lord."

"Very good, my lord."

                 *        *        *        *        *

==> Wimsey had his round of golf with the Provost, but without much <==
satisfaction beyond that of beating him five up and three to play. He
deduced from this victory that the Provost was not altogether easy in
his mind, but he failed altogether to draw him on the subject of
Campbell. It was "an unfortunate occurrence," and the Provost thought
that "it might be a wee while before they got to the bottom of it"--and

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 50092    window = 50087 50097


after that the conversation was firmly led away to the quoiting match at
Gatehouse, the recent regatta at Kirkcudbright, the shortage of salmon
and depredations of poachers in the estuary, and the problems of
sewage-distribution in tidal waters.

==> At half-past nine, when Wimsey had absorbed his grilled steak and a <==
rhubarb tart, and was dreaming over some old numbers of _The
Gallovidian_, he was aroused by a clatter of feet upon the cobblestones
of the close. He was just rising to look out of the window, when there
was a knock upon the door, and a cheerful female voice called: "May we
come in?"

[line number in individual story] matching line = 2857    window = 2852 2862

continually to be found taking tea in each other's living-rooms or
bathing together on the sands at the Doon. Miss Selby was tall, dark,
rather angular, rather handsome in an uncompromising kind of way and
painted rather good, strong, angular and handsome figure-studies in
oils. Miss Cochran was round, cheerful, humorous and grey-haired; she
==> illustrated magazine stories in line and wash. Wimsey liked them both, <==
because they had no nonsense about them, and they liked him for the same
reason, and also because they found Bunter extremely amusing. Bunter was
always distressed to see them cooking their own dinners and putting up
their own curtains. He would step reproachfully to their assistance, and
take the hammer and nails from their hands, with a respectful, "Allow

take the hammer and nails from their hands, with a respectful, "Allow
me, miss"; and would obligingly offer to look after stews and casseroles
during their absence. They rewarded him with gifts of vegetables and
flowers from their garden--gifts which Bunter would receive with a
respectful, "Thank you, miss. His lordship will be greatly obliged."
==> While Wimsey was greeting his visitors, Bunter now advanced <==
unobtrusively and inquired, as soon as there was a pause in the
conversation, whether the ladies would take supper after their journey.

The ladies replied that they were quite well-fed, but a little
investigation showed that they had indeed had nothing since tea-time

unobtrusively and inquired, as soon as there was a pause in the
conversation, whether the ladies would take supper after their journey.

The ladies replied that they were quite well-fed, but a little
investigation showed that they had indeed had nothing since tea-time
==> except a few sandwiches on the train. Wimsey promptly ordered omelettes, <==
a bottle of claret and the remains of the rhubarb-tart to be brought
forward, and, when Bunter had withdrawn to prepare the feast, said:

"Well, you've missed all the excitement."

"Good gracious!" said Miss Selby.

"And who is it they're saying has done it?" demanded Miss Cochran.

==> "They don't know yet," said Wimsey, "but there's a kind of an idea that <==
it was a premeditated job."

"Oh, why?" asked Miss Cochran, bluntly.

"Oh, well, because the symptoms point that way, you know, and there

"And in fact you know more than you think you ought to tell us. Well,
it's fortunate we've got an alibi, isn't it, Margaret? We've been in
Glasgow ever since yesterday morning. It was on Tuesday it happened,
wasn't it?"

==> "It seems so," said Wimsey, "but just to make sure, they are checking up <==
everybody's whereabouts from Monday night onwards."

"Who's everybody?"

"Well--the people who knew Campbell best, and so on."

"Wasn't he with you?"

"With us?"

==> They stared at one another. Wimsey apologised. <==

"I'm sorry. Mrs. Doings--his landlady, what's her name?--told me Waters
had gone with you two to Glasgow."

"She must have got hold of the wrong end of the stick. He said on Sunday

so we thought he'd changed his mind. Anyhow, we didn't really expect
him, did we, Mary?"

"No. But isn't he here, then, Lord Peter?"

==> "Well, as a matter of fact, he's not," said Wimsey, aghast. <==

"Oh, well, he must be somewhere," said Miss Cochran, comfortably.

"Naturally," said Wimsey, "but he certainly went off at about 8.30
yesterday morning, saying he was going to Glasgow. Or at least, he seems

yesterday morning, saying he was going to Glasgow. Or at least, he seems
to have left that impression behind him."

"Well, he certainly never came to the station," said Miss Selby,
decidedly. "And he wasn't at the show either day, that I could see. But

"Well, he certainly never came to the station," said Miss Selby,
decidedly. "And he wasn't at the show either day, that I could see. But
of course he may have had other fish to fry."

==> Wimsey scratched his head. <==

"I must interview that woman again," he said. "I must have misunderstood
her. But it's exceedingly odd. Why should he get up and go out early if
he wasn't going to Glasgow? Especially----"

her. But it's exceedingly odd. Why should he get up and go out early if
he wasn't going to Glasgow? Especially----"

"Especially what?" said Miss Cochran.

==> "Well, I shouldn't have expected it," said Wimsey. "He was a bit lit-up <==
the night before, and as a rule it takes a lot to get Waters out of bed
at the best of times. It's rather unfortunate. Still, we can't do much
till he turns up."

"We?" said Miss Selby.

at the best of times. It's rather unfortunate. Still, we can't do much
till he turns up."

"We?" said Miss Selby.

==> "The police, I mean," said Wimsey, blushing a little. <==

"You'll be helping the police, I expect," said Miss Cochran. "I was
forgetting that you had such a reputation as a Sherlock. I'm sorry we

"Oh, Ferguson was there, was he?"

Miss Cochran, who darted a shrewd glance at him.

"Yes, he was there. I believe we can give ye the precise time we saw
him." (As Miss Cochran became more emphatic, she became more Scottish in
her accent. She planted her plump feet squarely on the ground and leaned

should we see but Mr. Ferguson, just coming away. So of course we spoke
to him and he said he'd been through the rooms pretty thoroughly once
and was coming back next day. However, he went round once again with
us."

==> Wimsey, who had been trying to hold the whole local time-table in his <==
head and was hurriedly calculating arrivals and departures, broke in at
this point.

"I suppose he really _had_ been through the place already?"

didn't see him, because the first thing he said when we met him was, 'I
saw you at the station, but you didn't see me. Was that Kathleen and her
good man with you?' And then he mentioned that he had been in the same
train."

==> "Pretty good," said Wimsey. "Well, as you say, we'll have to see <==
Ferguson--I mean, the police will have to see him."

Miss Cochran shook her head.

"You can't deceive me," she said. "You're in it up to the eyes. If the

Miss Cochran shook her head.

"You can't deceive me," she said. "You're in it up to the eyes. If the
truth were told, I dare say you did it yourself."

==> "No," said Wimsey. "This is about the only murder I couldn't possibly <==
have committed. I haven't the technical skill."

satisfactory: it depended on technical matters which he did not
personally understand, but he was open-minded enough to accept expert
opinion on such matters. He would, for instance, have taken his Cousin
Tom's advice on electricity or his sister Alison's opinion about ladies'
underwear, and he was not unprepared to admit that a gentleman like

Accordingly, he perceived that all artists were, for his purpose,
suspect, no matter how rich, respectable or mild-mannered they might be,
and whether they were known to have quarrelled with Campbell or not.

                              MRS. McLEOD

==> Things were lively in the Close that night. Wimsey had escorted his <==
visitors to their doors, and was thinking of turning in, when the sudden
opening of the blue gate and the cries of a fellow-creature entangled
and in pain urged him to go to the assistance of the Chief Constable,
who had become involved with the bicycles in the narrow passage.

opening of the blue gate and the cries of a fellow-creature entangled
and in pain urged him to go to the assistance of the Chief Constable,
who had become involved with the bicycles in the narrow passage.

"I don't mind telling you," said Sir Maxwell, when at length he was
==> safely seated in Wimsey's armchair and comforted with Scotch, "that I am <==
greatly disturbed about all this business. If I could see any clear line
to follow up, it would be more satisfactory. Even supposing that your
list of suspects comprises the whole of the possibilities (which at
present, mark you, I am not disposed to grant)--even then, I simply do
not know where to start an inquiry. That one or two of them should have

not know where to start an inquiry. That one or two of them should have
no good alibis is only what one might expect--but that practically all
of them should be open to suspicion really bewilders me."

==> "Dear me!" said Wimsey. <==

"Graham and Strachan," went on the Chief Constable, "were both out all
night, as you know, and have no explanations. Ferguson appears, from
what you say, to be all right, but he has not been interrogated yet, and
really, after to-day's experiences, I am beginning to doubt whether

with the servants, and resumed:

"There are undoubtedly points there that need looking into. And now
comes a most infernal business about Waters."

==> "Unbosom yourself," said Wimsey. "Trouble shared is trouble halved." <==

"Well," said Sir Maxwell, "when Waters didn't turn up to-day with the
ladies yonder, Inspector Macpherson made a few further inquiries of Mrs.
McLeod, who seems to have misled you--though, I think and hope,
unintentionally. And these inquiries brought to light a very remarkable

"Now, there are two more interesting points. First of all, Waters
went--ostensibly to see an exhibition in Glasgow--in an old sweater, a
pair of grey flannel bags, tennis-shoes and an old burberry. And
secondly, he took his bicycle with him."

==> "What?" cried Wimsey. <==

"He took his bicycle with him. Or rather, to be accurate, his bicycle,
which stands just inside the front door, was there on the Monday night
and was gone at 8.20. The presumption is that Waters took it."

"Good Lord!"

"What do you make of that?" demanded the Chief Constable.

==> "What you want me to make of it," said Wimsey, slowly, "is that the man <==
in the street was Campbell, come back to finish out his row with Waters.
That they went off together to fight it out. That in the row, Campbell
got his head bashed in. That Waters then concealed the body somewhere.
That he came home, in order to look as ordinary as possible. That he
then thought out a plan of concealment, and that next morning he went

off at the time previously appointed, put the body and the bicycle in
Campbell's car, and hared off to the Minnoch to fake the accident."

"Can you make anything else of it?"

==> "I _might_ make fifty things," said Wimsey, "but--not to practise any <==
mean concealment, I will admit that the circumstances seem to fit the
crime. Except, perhaps, for one point."

"Yes, I thought of that. What did he do with the body between midnight
and 8 a.m.?"

crime. Except, perhaps, for one point."

"Yes, I thought of that. What did he do with the body between midnight
and 8 a.m.?"

==> "No," said Wimsey. "No--I see no difficulty about that. All he had to do <==
was to put the body in the car and run it along to his studio. There is
plenty of open space there where people often stand cars and carts, and
nobody would take any notice of an old car with junk in it, covered with
a rug. It's not as if he'd left it in Piccadilly Circus. People leave
cars in the street all night in this place, and nobody bothers. No,

"Of course, I'd rather we could work it ourselves. Macpherson is a good
man and so is Dalziel."

at Stranraer?"

Sir Maxwell groaned.

"A wash-out. He turns out to be a perfectly respectable stranger

his story is perfectly straight, and that he's guilty of nothing worse
than being too drunk to go back to work on Monday night. Confound the
fellow! He's wasted a whole day of our best man's time, and left us
exactly where we were before. I hope he's sacked, that's all."

==> "Oh, don't be vindictive," said Wimsey. "He couldn't know how <==
inconvenient he was going to be. He 'maun ha' gotten a rare fricht,' as
the man in Ian Hay's book said about the lice in his blanket."

The Chief Constable grunted.

His business here was the purely routine matter of checking the tickets
issued and collected on the Tuesday between Gatehouse and St. Enoch and
Kirkcudbright and St. Enoch respectively. He found that these had
already been made up and found to agree perfectly with the returns sent
==> in by the issuing clerks. Wimsey's vague suggestion that Waters might <==
have started from Kirkcudbright with a Glasgow ticket and disappeared
_en route_ was evidently incorrect. If, unseen by either the officials
or by Miss Selby and Miss Cochran, he had indeed taken the 8.45 from
Kirkcudbright, he must have booked to some intermediate station. But
there seemed no reason at all to suppose that he had ever started by

                          INSPECTOR MACPHERSON

At headquarters, meanwhile, the market in evidence was looking up. At
==> least, as Wimsey observed to the Chief Constable, it was not looking up <==
so much as looking about in all directions.

The first piece of excitement was provided by a young farmer, who
presented himself rather diffidently at Kirkcudbright police-station and
asked to see Inspector Macpherson.

On the same Thursday morning that took Sergeant Dalziel and Constable
Ross to Ayr and set Inspector Macpherson to work at time-schedules, Lord
==> Peter Wimsey presented himself at the farther of the two cottages at <==
Standing Stone Pool.

The door was opened by Mr. Ferguson in person, palette in hand, and
dressed in a pair of aged flannel bags, an open shirt and a shapeless

The door was opened by Mr. Ferguson in person, palette in hand, and
dressed in a pair of aged flannel bags, an open shirt and a shapeless
and bulging jacket. He seemed a little disconcerted at the sight of an

"Not a bit. It doesn't worry me. Have a drink?"

"No, thanks, I've just had one. You carry on and don't mind me."

==> Wimsey cleared a number of books and papers from a chair and sat down, <==
while Ferguson returned to the contemplation of a large canvas, in which
Wimsey recognised the typical Ferguson of Graham's malicious
description--the tree with twisted roots, the reflection, the lump of
granite and the blue distance and the general air of decorative
unreality.

He added a blob of scarlet vermilion to the semi-circle of colours, and
appeared to think that his palette was made up, for he took up a bunch
of brushes and began to mix two or three paints together.

remarked carelessly:

"So you've lost your next-door neighbour."

"Oh, yes. Apparently it's just as well I had an alibi. I say,

"Oh, I dunno. There might have been some fellow sleepin' up there in the
hills."

"H'm. Why couldn't he just have hit his head on the stones in falling?"

==> Wimsey groaned within himself. This perpetual parrying of pertinent <==
questions was growing wearisome. One after another, everybody wanted to
know the same thing. He replied, vacuously:

"Couldn't say. Seems on the whole the likeliest idea, don't it? If I
were you, I'd ask the doctor johnnie."

"Oh, yes, I saw him all right. At least, I suppose if I had to go into
the witness-box, I could only swear to his clothes and general
appearance. I didn't see his face. But there was no doubt it was
Campbell all right."

had seen the handcuffs closing on Ferguson. If he had sworn to seeing
Campbell alive at an hour when Wimsey knew him to have been dead----!
But things were not made as easy as all that for detectives.

Campbell was out--rather fortunately, because I gathered there was a
perfectly good shindy brewing."

"Who was the fellow?"

==> Ferguson glanced at Wimsey, then back at his canvas, and said in a low <==
tone:

"As a matter of fact, I'm afraid it was Farren."

Wimsey whistled.

was. I said I hadn't seen him all day and advised Farren to remove
himself. So then he started some rigmarole about always finding the

and 'bring us together.' Blast her cheek! She created a damned
embarrassing situation. Not that it matters now. But I can't stick those
interfering, well-meaning bitches. Now, whenever she meets me, she looks
mournfully and forgivingly in my eyes. I can't stand that kind of muck."

==> "Beastly," agreed Wimsey. "Like the people who offer to pray for you. <==
Did Farren depart altogether, or did he by any chance come back?"

"I don't know. That's just the point. _Somebody_ came later on."

"When was that?"

"Farren too. But particularly the midnight person. After all, he
apparently _was_ the last to see Campbell alive."

"What do you mean? I saw him in the morning."

==> "Saw him to speak to," said Wimsey. "He might be able to give the police <==
valuable help, if they could get hold of him."

"Why hasn't he come forward, then?"

"Oh, Lord! a hundred reasons. He may have been selling illicit salmon,

"True. All right. I'll come clean, as they say. I'd better do it at
once, or they'll think I know more than I do."

He wasted none himself, but drove straight back to Kirkcudbright, where
he met Inspector Macpherson just stepping into his car.

He unfolded his budget, while the Inspector sat licking his lips.

"Ay, that's a fact. He said he wad hae 't oot wi' Campbell an' then mak'

"I'm thinking," pursued Macpherson, "we'll no be far wrang if we send a

thinkin' this'll juist be the verra thing that Mistress Farren's
fearin', though she disna like tae say so."

killed himself, and daren't say so because she suspects he may have done
the murder. You'd better get your sleuth-hounds out at once, Inspector,
and then we'll pop along and have a hunt for this spanner."

"There's a terrible deal of work tae be done," said Macpherson. "I'll
doot we'll no have men enough for a' these investigations."

There's mony a slip, an' I'm no losin' sight o' ony o' my suspectit

Wee Helen had described the site of Campbell's encounter with the man in

steps when he got to places--struck against something which gave out a
metallic noise. He stooped, looked, and let out a loud yell.

The Inspector came galloping up.

==> "Here you are," said Wimsey, with conscious pride. <==

It was a big King Dick spanner, slightly rusty with the dew, lying
within a couple of feet of the wall.

"Ye've no touched it?" asked the Inspector, anxiously.

Macpherson knelt down, drew out a tape-measure and solemnly measured the
distance of the spanner from the wall. He then peered over the wall into
the road and, drawing out his notebook, made a careful plan of the exact
position. After that, he took out a large jack-knife and thrust it in

the spanner, covering his fingers with a large white handkerchief and
wrapping the folds of the linen tenderly about it.

"There might be finger-prints, ye ken," said he.

==> "Ay, there might," agreed Wimsey, in the language of the country. <==

"And then we've only tae get the prints of Farren and compare them. How
will we do that now?"

"Razor," said Wimsey, "palette-knife, picture-frames, pots--anything in

place on the other side of the road. There won't be much trace of it
now, I'm afraid."

The Inspector shook his head.

tak' a look round."

The tarmac itself betrayed nothing, and the indications in the grass
were so vague that nothing could be made of them. Presently, however,

small astonished noise.

"What's that?" asked Macpherson.

"What indeed?" said Wimsey. "It's one of these problems, Inspector,

Wimsey, beating about among a tuft of bramble and bracken, uttered a
small astonished noise.

"What's that?" asked Macpherson.

that's what it is. Did you ever hear of the Kilkenny cats that fought
till only their tails were left behind them? Now here are two gentlemen
having a fight, and both of them spirited away, leaving only a tuft of
hair. And what's more, it's the wrong colour. What do you make of that?"

He held up in his hand a tuft of curly blackness suggestive of an
Assyrian wall-painting.

"That's a queer thing," said Macpherson.

==> "Cut off, not torn out," said Wimsey. He pulled a lens from his pocket <==
and examined the trophy carefully. "It's soft and silky, and it's never
been trimmed at the distal end; it might come from one of those sweet
old-fashioned, long-haired girls, but the texture's a bit on the coarse
side. It's a job for an expert, really, to say where it does come from."

night. But if it isn't Mrs. Farren's, Inspector, where's our theory?"

"Hoots!" said the Inspector. "Maybe it has naething tae do wi' the case
at a'."

==> "How sensible you are," said Wimsey, "and how imperturbable. Calm <==
without something or other, without o'er-flowing, full. Talking of that,
how soon will the pubs be open? Hullo! here's another bunch of hair.
Some love-token! I say, let's trot home with this and interview Bunter.
I've a notion it may interest him."

"Ye think so?" said Macpherson. "Weel, that's no a bad idea, neither.
But I'm thinkin' we'll better be away tae Newton-Stewart first. We'll
have tae find the doctor and get the undertaker tae open the coffin.
I've a great fancy tae see how this spanner fits yon wound in the heid."

==> "Very good," said Wimsey, "so have I. But just a minute. We'd better <==
have a look first and see if we can find out what happened to the body.
The murderer stuck it into his car and drove off towards Gatehouse with
it. He can't have gone far, because he very soon came back for
Campbell's Morris, so there ought to be a gate about here somewhere. In
fact, I fancy I remember seeing one."

The search did not take long. About fifty yards farther along the bend
they came to a rusty iron gate on the right-hand side. This led into a
grassy lane which, after about thirty yards, turned abruptly to the left
and was hidden behind some bushes.

==> "Here's the place," said Wimsey. "There's been a car up here lately. You <==
can see where the wing scraped the post. The gate has a hook and
chain--easy enough to undo. He must have backed it in up to the bend.
Then, if he turned the lights off, it would be absolutely invisible from
the road. There's no difficulty about that, and there's no other
possible hiding-place for a mile or so, I'm certain of that. Well,

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 52452    window = 52447 52457



Dr. Cameron was greatly interested in the spanner, and experienced so
much difficulty in keeping his hands off it, that it was thought best to
have it tested for finger-prints before anything else was done. By the
combined exertions of the police-staff, the local photographer and
==> Wimsey, this was done. A magnificent thumb-print made its appearance <==
after a dusting with mercury powder, and a perfectly good negative was
"secured," to use the journalist's pet phrase.

In the meantime, a constable had rounded up the undertaker, who arrived
in great excitement, swallowing the last fragments of his tea. A slight

In the meantime, a constable had rounded up the undertaker, who arrived
in great excitement, swallowing the last fragments of his tea. A slight
further delay was caused by its occurring to somebody that the Fiscal
should be notified. The Fiscal, fortunately enough, happened to be in
==> the town, and joined the party, explaining to Wimsey as they drove along <==
to the mortuary that this was the most painful case he had handled in
the whole of his experience, and that he had been much struck by the
superiority of the Scots law to the English in these matters. "For,"
said he, "the publicity of a coroner's inquest is bound to give much
unnecessary pain to the relations, which is avoided by our method of

[line number in individual story] matching line = 5220    window = 5215 5225

superiority of the Scots law to the English in these matters. "For,"
said he, "the publicity of a coroner's inquest is bound to give much
unnecessary pain to the relations, which is avoided by our method of
private investigation."

==> "That is very true," said Wimsey, politely, "but think of all the extra <==
fun we get from the Sunday newspapers. Inquests are jam to them."

"We then proceeded," ran Inspector Macpherson's official notes on this
occasion, "to the mortuary, where the coffin was unscrewed in the
presence of the Fiscal, Dr. Cameron, James McWhan (the undertaker), Lord

occasion, "to the mortuary, where the coffin was unscrewed in the

comparison of the spanner formerly mentioned with the wounds upon the
head of the corpse, Dr. Cameron gave it as his opinion that a contused
area upon the left cheek-bone agreed exactly in contour with the head of
the said spanner and had in all probability been inflicted by that or by
a similar instrument. With regard to the larger contused area upon the

the said spanner."

After this triumphant entry, which bears the marks of considerable
literary effort, appears another.

==> "Acting upon the suggestion of Lord Peter Wimsey" (the Inspector was a <==
just man, giving honour where it was due, regardless of his own
lacerated feelings), "the finger-prints of the corpse were then taken."
(This last phrase is erased, and a better locution substituted), "a
record was then secured of the finger-prints of the corpse. On
comparison of this record with the thumb-print found upon the spanner,

finger-print in his hands, as though his case were concluded, and now,
suddenly, he was taken up and cast down into the old outer darkness of
uncertainty and gnashing of teeth. But his behaviour was handsome to the
last degree.

==> "It's a great maircy," said he to Wimsey, "that your lordship should ha' <==
taken the notion tae have that done. It wad never have entered my heid.
We might have eliminated a' six suspects on the strength o' that
deceivin' finger-print. It was a gran' notion of yours, my lord, a gran'
notion."

deceivin' finger-print. It was a gran' notion of yours, my lord, a gran'

He sighed deeply.

==> "Cheer up," said Wimsey. "It's all the luck of the game. Come and have a <==
spot of dinner with me at the Galloway Arms."

Now that was an unlucky suggestion.

every evening in the week, and all the news of the town was bound to

"Here he is! Here he is! Come away in! Here's the man to tell us all
about it!"

==> "All about what?" said Wimsey, knowing only too well. "What to back for <==
the Leger?"

"Leger be damned. All about this business of poor Campbell. It's
terrible the way the police come running in and out of one's house. One
doesn't feel safe for a moment. Luckily I've got a cast-iron alibi, or

==> "No, Bob, not you," said Wimsey. <==

"Oh, ye never know these days. But very fortunately I was at dinner with
the Provost Monday night and didn't get home till midnight, and on
Tuesday morning I was showing myself up and down St. Cuthbert's Street.

county, besides Jock, knew that Campbell meant to go up to the Minnoch
on Tuesday?"

"You had better ask who did not?" said the doctor. "He said so here on
the Sunday night. He'd been making a preliminary sketch that afternoon.

I said something about it to Farren on the Monday morning, because he
had a tea-party or something fixed up for Brighouse Bay on Tuesday and
said he hoped they wouldn't run into Campbell."

"I knew, too," said Strachan. "My wife and I met him up there on Sunday,

Wimsey nodded. "Campbell seems to have been more communicative than
usual," he remarked.

"All the same," said Mrs. Anderson, "Campbell ought not to have spoken
of Gowan as he did."

"Gowan's away, isn't he? They told me he had gone to London. By the way,

"I haven't the foggiest. As far as I can make out, he's supposed to be
in Glasgow. Did you see anything of him, Ferguson?"

was very irritating. Something went wrong with my magneto, otherwise I
should have got up early and run over to catch the 7.30 express from
Dumfries, instead of waiting for that ghastly 11.22, which stops at
every station."

==> "Rather than travel by a confirmed stopper," said Wimsey, "I'd have <==
waited a little longer and gone by the 1.46."

"Taking the 10.56 from Gatehouse, you mean?"

"Or the 11 o'clock 'bus. It gets you in to Dumfries at 12.25."

in to Glasgow till 3.34. So I had to make a martyr of myself. And the
sickening thing was that my man never turned up after all. I found a
note at my hotel, saying he'd been called to see a sick relative."

"Yes; I was damned fed-up. However, I took my mag. along to Sparkes &

"Yes; I don't know exactly when I got there, but they'll be able to say.

clothes--with a black tie, naturally. Can you see me in a top-hat?"

I expect he has. He remembers everything. Did you decide to send one
from the Club, Strachan?"

"What did she think about it all?"

"Well, Jock, what could she think? She seemed very much distressed, as
you would expect."

==> "No idea of who might have done it, I suppose?" suggested Wimsey. <==

"No--I gathered that she hadn't seen anything of her brother for some
years. She's married to an engineer in Edinburgh, and, though she didn't
say much, I rather fancy the two men didn't hit it off very well."

very much it'll all turn out to be a mare's nest. I can't really believe
that anybody about here could have committed a murder. I think the
police are just anxious to make a sensation. Probably it was only an
accident, after all."

Wimsey guessed that his colleague at Newton-Stewart must have said
something, and hastened to lead the conversation away on lines which

that was anchored up by the Doon," said the Harbour-master, placidly.

The Council should du something aboot it. I remember, when I was a young

Forgive me, won't you? I have an appointment."

He dashed off in the direction of the police-station, leaving the
Harbour-master to stare after him in surprise.

                             CONSTABLE ROSS

The next day dawned wild and stormy, with heavy rain and violent squalls
==> of south-west wind. Wimsey's sketching-party was perforce postponed. <==
Nevertheless, the day was not wholly lacking in incident.

The first thing that happened was the sudden return of Constable Ross
from Ayr, with a remarkable story.

Of these seven possibilities, Ross was able to eliminate the 1.56, the
2.30 and the 2.35. Nobody in the least corresponding to the description
had travelled by any of them. The 2.45 to Stranraer he thought he could
also dismiss. It had the advantage of bringing the murderer (if it was
==> the murderer) back on his tracks--and Ross bore in mind Wimsey's remark <==
that the murderer would probably wish to reappear at home as soon and as
plausibly as possible--but it seemed almost inconceivable that anybody
should take the trouble to go all the way to Ayr to get rid of a bicycle
which could have been dumped so much more readily and easily at some
point nearer home.

He turned away homewards.

"Poker-faced man, that," he muttered to himself. "I don't trust him. But
of course Farren may have nothing to do with all this. This
==> extraordinary story of Wimsey's----" <==

For Wimsey had, an hour or so earlier, given him a shock beside which
all other shocks were a gentle tickling.

                                 BUNTER

The shock was a staggerer of the first water, and lost nothing of its
force by being conveyed in terms of the most melancholy reproach. With
==> bent head Wimsey bowed to the storm, and at the end had so little spirit <==
left in him that he meekly allowed himself to be stripped of his grey
flannel suit and sent to attend Campbell's funeral in a black
morning-coat, top-hat and black kid gloves, to the consternation of his
friends and the immense admiration of Mr. McWhan.

morning-coat, top-hat and black kid gloves, to the consternation of his
friends and the immense admiration of Mr. McWhan.

The trouble was this. On the Thursday morning, Bunter had asked for and
received leave of absence in order to attend the cinema. Owing to
==> Wimsey's having dinner with Inspector Macpherson at Newton-Stewart and <==
then gone straight on to Bob Anderson's, he had not seen Bunter again
until he returned between midnight and one o'clock in the morning after
his visit to the police station.

Then his first words were:

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 53354    window = 53349 53359


To which Bunter replied:

"I was about, my lord, to make a similar communication to your
lordship."

==> "Somebody's just made a moonlight flitting," said Wimsey. "I've been <==
round to tell the police. At least," he corrected himself, "not
moonlight, because there is no moon; in fact, it's beastly dark and I
fell over some confounded steps, but the principle is the same and have
you got any arnica?"

that she was to receive permission to spend this evening out. I invited
her to attend the cinematograph entertainment in my company. The film
was one which I had already seen in London, but to her it was a novelty
and she accepted with apparent pleasure."

==> "No doubt," said Wimsey. <==

"During the course of the performance I contrived to render our
relations somewhat more confidential."

"Bunter! Bunter!"

certainty was preferable to agitating suspicions. She got up, crept
cautiously past the bedroom of the two Alcocks and went up to the top of
the house again. She ventured a little way down the corridor, when she
was rooted to the spot by the sound of a hollow groan."

==> "Really, Bunter," said Wimsey, "your narrative style would do credit to <==
the _Castle of Otranto_."

"Thank you, my lord. I am only acquainted by repute with the work you
mention, but I understand that it enjoyed a considerable vogue in its
day. The girl Elizabeth was hesitating whether to shriek or to run away,

face looked out at her."

Bunter appeared to be enjoying the sensation he was producing, and
paused.

==> "A terrible face," said Wimsey. "Very well, I've got that. A terrible <==
face. Next, please!"

"The face, as I understand," pursued Bunter, "was enveloped in
grave-clothes. The jaws were closely bound up, the features were hideous
and the lips writhed away from the protruding teeth and the apparition

was of a ghastly pallor."

fancy adjectives and say plainly what the face was like?"

"I had not myself the opportunity of observing the face," said Bunter,
reprovingly, "but the impression produced on me by the young woman's
observations was that of a dark-haired, clean-shaven man with protruding

She then remembered that she deserved rebuke for having gone into the
upstairs corridor and retired to her own room to hide her head in the
bed-clothes."

==> "The best thing she could do," said Wimsey. <==

"Precisely, my lord. Thinking the matter over during the forenoon, she
came to the very reasonable conclusion that the person she had seen
might, after all, not be a living corpse but merely a sick man. She was,
however, quite sure that she had never seen the person's face in her

however, quite sure that she had never seen the person's face in her
life. She now noticed that food was disappearing at every meal in excess
of that consumed by herself and the Alcocks, and this she found
encouraging, because, as she observed, dead folks do not eat."

==> "True," replied Wimsey. "As G. K. C. says, 'I'd rather be alive than <==
not.'"

"Quite so, my lord. I spoke as encouragingly as possible to the young
woman and offered to accompany her back to Mr. Gowan's house. She

"Quite so, my lord. I spoke as encouragingly as possible to the young
woman and offered to accompany her back to Mr. Gowan's house. She
informed me, however, that she had received permission to spend the
night at her mother's."

==> "Indeed?" said Wimsey. <==

"Precisely. I therefore took her home and returned to the High Street,
where I observed Mr. Gowan's saloon car standing before the door. It was
then five minutes to eleven. It was borne in upon me, my lord, that some
person was about to take a surreptitious departure from Mr. Gowan's

"Gowan? Then who was the mysterious stranger?"

"I could not say, my lord. The car moved away, and, on consulting my
watch, I found that the time was three minutes past eleven."

==> "H'm," said Wimsey. <==

"I formed the opinion, my lord, that Mr. Gowan had, after all, not
departed from Kirkcudbright on the Monday evening as Alcock had stated,
but that he had remained concealed in his own house in attendance upon
the sick person observed by Elizabeth."

"I returned here," pursued Bunter, "and consulted the local time-table.
I found that there was a train leaving Dumfries for Carlisle and the
South at two minutes past midnight. It appeared conceivable that Mr.
Gowan was intending to catch it either at Dumfries or at

"I thought it best, my lord, in view of the delicacy of the
circumstances, to communicate directly with Sir Maxwell Jamieson. I
hastened to the Selkirk Arms and put in a call from there."

==> "You must have passed me," said Wimsey. "I had just hared across to the <==
police-station, but Inspector Macpherson wasn't there."

"I regret extremely that I should have missed your lordship. I informed
Sir Maxwell of the circumstances, and I understood him to say that he
would immediately telephone to Castle-Douglas and Dumfries, with a view

would immediately telephone to Castle-Douglas and Dumfries, with a view
to intercepting Mr. Gowan if he should make his appearance at either of
those points, and that he would also circulate a description of the car
and its driver."

==> "Well, well, well," said Wimsey. "For a quiet country place, <==
Kirkcudbright seems to boast a bright lot of inhabitants. They appear
and disappear like Cheshire cats. I give it up. Bring forward the arnica
and a whiskey-and-soda, and let's get to bed. All I know is, that it's
perfectly useless for me to try and detect things. You're always off the
mark before me."

that the car shuld ha' stopped on the outskirts of Castle-Douglas or
Dumfries tae let Gowan tak' the train on his ain feet, but that they
should ha' missed Gowan is no thinkable--and him so conspicuous wi' his
big black beard an' a'."

==> Wimsey suddenly uttered a loud yelp. <==

"Oh, Inspector, Inspector! He's done it on us! What dolts and ninnies we
are! And now I suppose that damned photograph has been circulated all
over the country. Show Bunter the specimen, Inspector. I told you we
ought to have done that before we did anything else. This will be the

doubtless aware, my lord, that the strict followers of this sect
consider it unlawful to trim the hair of the face, with the consequence
that the beard is extremely silky in texture, each hair preserving the
natural tapering point."

==> Wimsey, without a word, handed Bunter his lens. <==

"Your lordship has doubtless observed," pursued Bunter, "that this
specimen conforms in every particular to this description, and having
seen Mr. Gowan's beard, I do not hesitate to give it as my personal
opinion--subject to expert correction--that Mr. Gowan will now be found

seen Mr. Gowan's beard, I do not hesitate to give it as my personal
opinion--subject to expert correction--that Mr. Gowan will now be found
to be deprived, in whole or in part, of that facial adornment."

==> "I'm afraid you're right, Bunter," said Wimsey, sadly. <==

"Now we know who the mysterious stranger was, and what he was suffering
from. You'll have to revise your time-scheme, Inspector, and put Gowan
in the leading rÃ´le."

"I must go and send off a corrected description at once," said the
Inspector.

==> "Just so," said Wimsey. "But have you the slightest idea what Gowan <==
looks like without his beard? Inspector, I venture to prophesy that it
will be a shock to you. When a man grows a jungle of face-fungus up to
his cheek-bones and half-way down his chest, he had generally something
to hide. I have known revelations----" he sighed. "Do you realise? my
dear man, that you have never seen _anything_ of Gowan, except his eyes

and a somewhat exaggerated nose?"

"We'll catch him by his nose," said the Inspector, without the slightest
humorous intention. He bustled away.

==> "Bunter," said Wimsey, "this case resembles the plot of a Wilkie Collins <==
novel, in which everything happens just too late to prevent the story
from coming to a premature happy ending."

"Yes, my lord."

recollect that it was not until after lunch-time on the Tuesday that she
saw Alcock enter the Bluebeard's Chamber, if I may use so fanciful an
expression, and that the sick man was not seen by her in person until
early on Wednesday morning."

==> "True," said Wimsey, thoughtfully. "We have no evidence that he was <==
there on Tuesday at all. Alcock will have to be interrogated. And in my
opinion, Alcock is a man of considerable resource and sagacity."

"Exactly so, my lord. And, what is more, Alcock has disappeared also."

Inspector see the receipt? Certainly he might. The signature was J.
Brown. The Inspector wondered how many J. Browns there might be among
London's four million, and turned his weary steps towards Scotland Yard.

Here he asked for Chief Inspector Parker, who received him with more

Parker's best attention, and the complicated story of Gowan and the
spanner, Farren, Strachan and the two bicycles, was sympathetically
listened to.

                           LORD PETER WIMSEY

==> "Strachan!" said Lord Peter Wimsey. <==

Mr. Strachan started so violently that he nearly pitched himself and his
canvas into a rock-pool. He was perched rather uneasily on a lump of
granite on the Carrick shore, and was industriously painting the Isles
of Fleet. There was a strong wind and the menace of heavy storm, which

granite on the Carrick shore, and was industriously painting the Isles
of Fleet. There was a strong wind and the menace of heavy storm, which
together were producing some curious cloud effects over a rather
fretful-looking sea.

==> "Oh, hullo, Wimsey!" he said. "How on earth did you get here?" <==

"Drove here," said Wimsey. "Fresh air and that kind of thing." He sat
down on a convenient knob of rock, settled his hat more firmly on his
head and pulled out a pipe, with the air of a man who has at last found
an abiding-place.

[line number in individual story] matching line = 6736    window = 6731 6741

down on a convenient knob of rock, settled his hat more firmly on his
head and pulled out a pipe, with the air of a man who has at last found
an abiding-place.

Strachan frowned. He did not much care for spectators when he was

tobacco-pouch, and appeared impervious to nods and winks.

"Very windy, isn't it?" said Strachan, when the silence had lasted some
time.


[line number in individual story] matching line = 6748    window = 6743 6753

"But it's not raining," pursued Strachan.

"Not yet," said Wimsey.

"Very," said Wimsey.

"But it's not raining," pursued Strachan.

"Better than yesterday," said Strachan, and realised at once that he had
said a foolish thing. Wimsey turned his head instantly and said
brightly:

"Tons better. Really, you know, you'd think they'd turned on the

"Tons better. Really, you know, you'd think they'd turned on the

"Oh, well," said Strachan.

==> "Well, perhaps it was rather a wild idea," said Wimsey, "but it appealed <==
to me rather. That's rather nice," he added, "how long have you been on
that?"

"About an hour," said Strachan.

begin--tubes of colour in the same order on my tray, dipper just here,
spare brushes hung on there--even my palette is always made up in the
same order, though not always with the same colours, of course. But,
roughly speaking, it follows the order of the spectrum."

==> "I see," said Wimsey. "I'm not methodical myself, but I do admire <==
method. My man, Bunter, is a marvel in that way. It is such a grief to
him to find all kinds of odds and ends bulging my pockets or chucked
helter-skelter into the collar-drawer."

"Oh, I'm terrible about drawers, too," said Strachan. "My tidiness

"Not the least. Hopelessly unobservant. I haven't even got a good visual
memory. Some people can come back from a place and make a picture of it
with every house and tree in its place, but I have to see things before
I can draw them. It's a drawback in a way."

==> "Oh, I could do that," said Wimsey. "If I could draw, I mean. F'r <==
instance--take the road between Gatehouse and Kirkcudbright. I could
make a plan of that, here and now, with every corner, every house,
practically every tree and gate on the road marked. Or if you drove me
along it blindfold, I could recite to you exactly what we were passing
at every moment."

"Oh!" said Strachan. "Yes, I suppose it would be--under those
circumstances."

"Your little story of the golf-ball on the links, for example," said
==> Wimsey. "How much better it would have been if surrounded and supported <==
by stout, upstanding, well-thought-out details. It wasn't a fearfully
good lie to start with, of course, because it really left rather _too_
much time unaccounted for. But since you stood committed to it, you
should have made more of it."

Besides----"

"Look here," said Strachan, with a lowering brow, "what the devil do you
mean by talking to me like this?"

==> "I'm just wondering," said Wimsey, "whether you cared to suggest any <==
other explanation for that black eye of yours. I mean, if you liked to
give it to me now, and it happened to be--well, say, anything in the
nature of a domestic fracas, or anything, I--er--I might not need to
pass it on, you see."

pass it on, you see."

"I don't see at all," said Strachan. "I think it's damned impertinence."

==> "Don't say that," pleaded Wimsey. "Look here, old man, your midnight <==
revels are nothing to me. If you were out on the tiles, or anything----"

"If you take that tone to me, I'll break your neck."

"For God's sake," cried Wimsey, "don't use any _more_ threats."

throat.

"Are you accusing me," he demanded, thickly, "of having anything to do

"Are you accusing me," he demanded, thickly, "of having anything to do
with murdering Campbell?"

==> "I'm not accusing anybody," said Wimsey, lightly, "of murdering <==
him--yet." He suddenly scrambled to his feet, and stood poised on the
rock, looking out away from Strachan over the sea. The clouds had blown
together into one threatening mass, and the waves were lipping along
cold and yellow, showing snarling little teeth of foam. "But I do accuse
you," he said, turning suddenly and leaning back against the wind to

The painter looked at him, and put the back of his hand up against his
forehead with a sort of desperation in the gesture.

down on his camp-stool, shaking. "I meant to kill you then. I've got
such a hell of a temper. What made you do that?"

coolly. "And you know," he added, "as a matter of fact, if you had

and then collected the tubes of paint from the ledge of the easel.

Superintendent's office, with his hands clasped over his walking-stick
and his chin on his hands, and he greeted the Sergeant with exasperating
cheerfulness.

"Hullo--ullo--ullo!" he said. "So here we are again."

"An' hoo did yew get here?" snapped Dalziel, his Galloway accent very
pronounced and sharpening his u's almost to the point of menace.

==> "In a rather roundabout way," said Wimsey, "but, generally speaking, by <==
train. I spent last night in Campbell's cottage. Arrived in Glasgow by
the 2.16 to see Picture Exhibition. Distressed fellow-countryman wires
to Kirkcudbright that he is in the hands of the children of Amalek and
will I come and disentangle him. Faithful valet sends wire on to Picture

and exceedingly angry Waters, dressed in a grubby waterproof and very
grubby sweater and flannel trousers. His untidy hair was pushed up into
a dissipated-looking comb by a linen bandage which half covered one eye,
and gave him a rake-helly and piratical appearance.

==> "Good Lord, man!" exclaimed Wimsey, "what the devil have you been doing <==
to yourself?"

"Doing to myself?" retorted Waters. "What the devil have all you people
been doing? What's all this damned fuss about? What's all this tripe
about Campbell? What in thunder do these damned idiots mean by arresting

"your eloquence is extremely impressive, but not more so than your
appearance, which is, if I may say so, picturesque in the extreme. Your
absence from your usual haunts has been causing acute distress to your

"See here, noo," put in Sergeant Dalziel. "Let's get a' this story

"Better tell him what he wants to know," said Wimsey. "I'll explain

right, and it didn't matter to me when I got to Glasgow, so I said I'd
think about it. So then he said wouldn't I go with him anyhow and have a
look at the _Susannah_. He'd got her lying off the Doon."

==> "That's right," said Wimsey to Dalziel. "There was a boat there on <==
Monday night, and she went off Tuesday morning."

"You seem to know all about it," said Waters. "Well, I thought I might
as well have the run. It seemed the best way of getting Drewitt out of
the house, so I put on a coat and went up with him. He'd hired a car

"No, there wasn't any need. She knew I was going to Glasgow and might be
away some days, and it was no concern of hers how I went. As a matter of
fact she was out at the back somewhere, and I didn't see her. I bicycled
up to the Doon, signalled to Drewitt and he took me off."

==> "What did you do with your bicycle?" asked Wimsey. <==

"I just shoved it into a little shed-place there is up there, among the
trees. I'd often put it there before when I was painting or bathing off
the Doon, and it never came to any harm. Well, that was that. As I was

_Express_ in Glasgow this afternoon, but I can't say I read them very
carefully; why?"

Sergeant.

"Ay, imph'm. It tallies well enough, only for the evidence of this man
Drewitt."

ye'd no need tae be answerin' my questions."

Waters had retired to write agitated letters and telegrams addressed to
the _Susannah_ at various possible and impossible ports, "that is a

"Ay, that's so. That's verra true. But supposin' Drewitt runs him up in

"Ay, that's so. That's verra true. But supposin' Drewitt runs him up in

window may have been Campbell or he may have been Drewitt. He can't have
been both. And somebody came back to Waters' bedroom that night and ate
his breakfast in the morning. He can't have been Campbell, and it's
extremely unlikely that it was Drewitt, so it must have been Waters. He
couldn't have got up to the Minnoch and back again in the time."

"Aweel," said Dalziel, resignedly, "I can see there'll be no kirk for me
the morn. It's awfu', the wark there is in a case the like o' this. An'
there's no train back tae Newton-Stewart the nicht."

and it was made of a fine cream-coloured serge which gave her an air of

"What makes you think that?" asked Mrs. Farren, never turning her
red-gold head.

"That," said Mrs. Farren, "is a very great impertinence."

foolish ideas of country policemen. I resent this inquisitiveness about
my private affairs extremely. The police I can forgive, Lord Peter, but
what business is it of yours?"

"What facts?"

"You might tell me, for instance," said Wimsey, "where the letter came

"Well, you know, he went off from here looking for Campbell. He was last
heard of inquiring for Campbell in Gatehouse. It would be interesting to
know if he did meet Campbell--wouldn't it?"

indignantly to face him. "Have you ever thought how contemptible you
are? We have received you here in Kirkcudbright as a friend. Everybody
has shown you kindness. And you repay it by coming into the houses of

"I am ready," said Gilda Farren, "to forgive----"

It is almost better to make a scene--though," he added, thoughtfully,

seemed suddenly to become aware of a tinge of bathos and went on

"Is it my fault that--just because this house was always a peaceful and

The motorist looked down at the book, with a slight smile twisting the
corners of his long mouth. Then he pulled a fountain-pen from his pocket
and wrote, beneath the signature of Mr. H. Ford:

==>     "Peter Wimsey. Kirkcudbright. Good baiting at the Bull." <==

Then, getting up and buckling the belt of his leather coat, he observed,
pleasantly:

"If any friends of mine should come inquiring for Mr. Ford, be sure you

London."

"Mester Parker?" said the landlady, mystified, but impressed. "Well, to
be sure, I'll tell 'en, sir."

==> Wimsey paid his bill and went out. As he drove away he saw her standing, <==
book in hand, under the signboard, staring at the bull which capered so
bravely on the bright green grass.

The village mentioned by the landlady was only about six miles from
Brough, and was reached by a side-turning. It possessed only one inn,

book in hand, under the signboard, staring at the bull which capered so
bravely on the bright green grass.

The village mentioned by the landlady was only about six miles from
Brough, and was reached by a side-turning. It possessed only one inn,
==> and that inn had no sign, only an empty iron bracket. Wimsey smiled <==
again, stopped his car at the door and passed into the bar, where he
ordered a tankard of beer.

"What's the name of your inn?" he asked, presently.

can make out. Very pleasant gentleman. Real artist--paints pictures for
the London shows, or so he tells me. My sign won't be any the worse for
a dab o' fresh paint--besides, it amuses the kids to watch him muckin'
about."

==> "Nothing I like better myself," said Wimsey, "than to hang round while <==
another fellow does a spot of work."

"No? Well, that's so, sir. If you like to step into the garden, sir,
you'll see him."

"No? Well, that's so, sir. If you like to step into the garden, sir,
you'll see him."

==> Wimsey laughed and wandered out, tankard in hand. He dodged under a <==
little archway, covered with a tangle of faded ramblers, and there, sure
enough, squatting on an upturned bucket with the signboard of the Dog
and Gun propped on a kitchen-chair before him, was the missing Hugh
Farren, whistling cheerfully, as he squeezed out paint upon his palette.

Three children watched, fascinated, as the thick blobs of colour oozed
out on to the board.

"What's that, mister?"

they're coming home with a lot of birds and things. I'll put a pink and
purple sunset into that if you're good and don't ask too many questions.
No, be a good girl and don't joggle my arm. Oh, Lord!"

"My God!" said the painter. "Wimsey, by all that's holy! How did you get

Farren sighed.

"Come on," he said. "Spit it out and get it over. Run away to your
mother, bairns. I've got to talk to this gentleman."

==> "Look here," said Wimsey, when they were alone. "I want to say, first of <==
all, that I haven't the faintest right to ask questions. But I'd be
damned glad if you'd tell me exactly what you've been up to since Monday
night."

"I suppose my conduct is being harshly criticised at Kirkcudbright,"

"I suppose my conduct is being harshly criticised at Kirkcudbright,"
said Farren. "Deserting the home, and all that?"

been hunting for you everywhere."

"The police? Why in the world----?"

talking rather wildly about suicide and other things, don't you know.
And then your bicycle being found close to those old mines up beyond
Creetown. It--suggested things, you see."

understand that Campbell is--was--a poisonous sort of hound and that she
was making me a laughing-stock. She's got an idea about being kind and

with Ferguson, but I wasn't as drunk as all that. Then I went and had a
few more. Somebody told me they'd seen Campbell go out to Creetown, so I
went after him."

"Did I? Oh, yes, so I did. I went to find Strachan, but he was out. I
left a note or a message for him, I think; to tell the truth, I'm not
very clear about it. But I think I told him I was going to Creetown to
do Campbell in and cut my own throat. Some rot or other.... I say, poor

where I was. It was the place they call New Brig o' Dee, on the New
Galloway Road. I hadn't really come so very far. I expect I must have
made a bit of a circle, though I thought I was keeping the sun on my
right all the time."

==> "The sun moves, you know," said Wimsey, "or appears to." <==

"Yes--I don't think I realised how long I'd been going. Anyhow, I got
there, and started to walk towards New Galloway. I met some sheep and a
few cows and carts, and at last a fellow with a lorry overtook me. He
took me as far as New Galloway, and I got something to eat there."

was a question whether I'd take the train there or put up in some pub or

go to Dumfries. That was the trouble about the pub idea too.... I don't

painting and made everything sound quite ordinary, and then I should
have gone home. You see. It wouldn't have been the same if I'd had to

odd. You create an illusion of liberty. Is it money? Or is it being
unmarried? But there are plenty of unmarried men who don't----"

==> "Aren't we wandering slightly from the matter in hand?" said Wimsey. <==

"Perhaps. Well--I went into a little inn--a one-horse little place--and
had a drink in the four-ale bar. There was a young fellow there with a
bike and side-car. He said he was going through to Carlisle. That gave
me an idea. I asked him if he'd take me and he said he would. He was a

have many ideas beyond plugs and things. He didn't talk. Said he'd been
thirty-six hours on the road, but I needn't worry, because he could
drive in his sleep."

==> Wimsey nodded. He knew the helots of the second-hand-motor trade. Grim, <==
silent, cynical, abroad at all hours and in all weathers, they are men
accustomed to disillusionment and disaster. To deliver their melancholy
screws to their customers and depart before inconvenient discoveries are
made; to scramble home with their surprise-packets of old iron before
the patched radiator bursts or the clutch gives way--this is their sole

power is outside you, and you are pulled along--in tow, so to speak.
Like being eloped with. You seem to notice the strength of the machine
more than you do in a car. Why is that?"

==> Wimsey shook his head. <==

"Perhaps I was imagining things. Well, anyhow, we got to Carlisle in the
morning and I had some grub in a sort of tea-shop place. Then, of
course, I had to decide on something. I bought a clean shirt and some
socks and a toothbrush and so on, and a knapsack to shove them into. It

would be more fun to pay my way. I'd still got enough to buy paints
with, so I went into an art-dealers' and got a box and a palette and
some brushes and colours----"

==> "Winsor & Newton, I observe," said Wimsey. <==

"Yes. You can get them easily in most places, you know. I usually get my
stuff from Paris, but Winsor & Newton are perfectly reliable. I thought
I'd make my way down into the Lake Country and paint little pictures for
tourists or something. It's fearfully easy. You can knock off two or

Farren took up his brushes again and renewed his assault upon the Dog
and Gun.

that you can't produce a single witness to say where you were between
Monday night and Tuesday afternoon at 3 o'clock."

"Oh! no--I'd forgotten about all that. But, I mean, all this isn't

infection of uneasiness, turned his head.

==> "I'm sorry," said Wimsey. "It fascinates me. I think the most joyous <==
thing in life is to loaf round and watch another bloke doing a job of
work. Look how popular the men are who dig up London with electric
drills. Duke's son, cook's son, son of a hundred kings--people will
stand there for hours on end, with their ear-drums splitting--why?
Simply for the pleasure of being idle while other people work."

"Very likely," said Waters. "But the row fortunately prevents them from
hearing the workmen's comments on their behaviour. How would you like me
to sit round and watch you detecting things?"

==> "That's different," said Wimsey. "The essence of detection is secrecy. <==
It has no business to be spectacular. But you can watch me if you like."

you when I've finished this panel."

"Everybody always hopes that."

Waters glanced at him sharply and uneasily, and laid his palette aside.

==> "Look here, Wimsey--you're not suggesting anything? I've told you all <==
about my movements, and I suppose you believe me. The police may be
excused for seeing nothing but the obvious, but I should have thought
that you at least had commonsense. If I had been murdering Campbell,
surely I should have taken care to provide myself with a better alibi."

==> "It depends on how clever you are," replied Wimsey, coolly. "You <==
remember Poe's bit about that in _The Purloined Letter_. A very stupid
murderer doesn't bother about an alibi at all. A murderer one degree
cleverer says, 'If I am to escape suspicion, I must have a good alibi.'
But a murderer who was cleverer still might say to himself, 'Everyone
will expect the murderer to provide a first-class alibi; therefore, the

"I can always find things when I want them."

"Campbell used a satchel, too."

"Then that was a bond of union between us, wasn't it?" Waters snatched

tube of rose madder, dabbed some paint on his palette, screwed up the
tube and tossed it back into the bag again.

it's such an awkward colour."

"All right. Well--you know that female at Newton-Stewart--the
Smith-Lemesurier woman?"

and smiled and languished at me and said that whatever I had done
wouldn't make any difference to her friendship, and talked about honour
and sacrifice and God knows what, till finally I had almost to shake it
out of her. Do you know what she's done?"

has been sacrificed on the altar of affection. But, dear old boy, we do
not blame you. We know that, rather than compromise a noble woman, you
would have gone to the scaffold with your lips locked in a chivalrous

be able to imitate Campbell's style. Start off now and do something and
I'll time you. Half a jiff! I'll run round to the police-station and
borrow the sketch for you to copy. It won't be quite the same thing, but
it will give us an idea."

Inspector Macpherson released the canvas without demur, but without
==> enthusiasm. He seemed, indeed, so much depressed that Wimsey paused to <==
ask what was the matter with him.

"Maitter eneugh," said Macpherson. "We've found a mon that saw
Campbell's car goin' up tae the Minnoch on Tuesday mornin', an' the
time-table's a' went tae hell."

"Ay. There's yin o' the men as is workin' at the road-mendin' on the

was goin' fast an' nearly ran him doon as he was comin' away on his

"Ay. We was calculatin' on him startin' oot at 7.30 fra' Gatehouse."

impossible that he could have caught the train at all!"

"That's so, but it must ha' been anither man a'tegither."

The Inspector shook his head, just as a constable knocked at the door
and, putting his head in, announced that Sergeant Dalziel was here with
Mr. Clarence Gordon to see the Inspector.

Mr. Clarence Gordon was a stout little gentleman with a pronounced

"Be covered, be covered," said that gentleman, graciously. "I fancy you
may be asked to make a sworn statement."

Mr. Gordon spread out his hands deprecatingly.

at 12.35. You're right, Inspector, that can't be our man. It's twelve
miles, good, from Barrhill to Girvan, and the man with the grey
suit--_our_ man, I mean--was there at 1.7. I don't think he could
possibly do it. Even a good bicyclist could hardly manage twenty-four

"I may go now? I have my bithneth to conthider."

"Not Strachan and not Gowan," he said. "Gowan's a verra big man."

"Not the murderer at all, apparently," said Wimsey. "Another red

wonderin' could it no be done after all? If ony of our men was trained

==> "Try _Who's Who_," suggested Wimsey--"it may throw some light on their <==
hideous pasts. I must run away now. I've got two artists straining at
the leash. Cry havoc! and let slip the dogs of war. It's curious how
blank verse seems to come natural to me to-day. It just shows how blank

On returning he found that Waters had supplied Graham with canvas,
palette, knife and brushes and was arguing cheerfully with him about the
rival merits of two different kinds of sketching easel.

==> Wimsey stood Campbell's sketch up on the table before them. <==

"Oh, that's the subject, is it?" said Graham. "H'm. Very characteristic.
Almost ultra-characteristic, don't you think, Waters?"

"That's exactly what one expects from the Campbells of this world," said

Graham picked the canvas up and carried it across to the light. He
frowned and rubbed the surface with a thoughtful thumb.

"Funny," he said, "the handling isn't altogether ... How many people

"Only myself and the police, so far. And the Fiscal, naturally."

"Ah!--well! Do you know, I should have said--if I didn't know what it
was----"

"I know," said Graham. "It reminds me of what the good lady said about
_Hamlet_--that it was all quotations."

==> "G. K. Chesterton says," put in Wimsey, "that most people with a very <==
well-defined style write at times what look like bad parodies of
themselves. He mentions Swinburne, for instance--that bit about 'From
the lilies and languors of virtue to the raptures and roses of vice.' I
expect painters do the same. But of course I don't know a thing about
it."

"Oh, Gowan's a man of method," said Graham. "I'm like a Waterman pen--I
function in any position. But he has to have everything just so. Never
mind. Here I am, like a fish out of water. I don't like your knife, I
don't like your palette and I simply loathe your easel. But you don't
imagine trifles like that are going to put me off. Not on your life.
==> Have at it. Are you standing by with the stop-watch, Wimsey?" <==

"Yes. Are you ready? One, two, three--go!"

quick or for being slow?"

==> "I haven't worked it out yet," said Wimsey, "but I don't mind telling <==
you that the less you dawdle the better I shall be pleased."

"It's not altogether a fair test," said Waters, mashing up his blue and
white to the colour of a morning sky. "Copying a canvas isn't the same
thing as painting direct. It's bound to be rather quicker."

whistling tuneless fragments of Bach.

At the end of an hour, Graham was a little farther advanced than Waters,

At the end of an hour, Graham was a little farther advanced than Waters,

scraped out something he had done, put it in again, cursed and said:

"I wish you'd go away."

The half-hour dragged to an end. Graham, glancing from the model to the
copy, said, "There, that's the best I can make of it," threw down his
palette and stretched himself. Waters glanced across at his work and
said, "You've beaten me on time," and painted on. He put in another

likewise.

"Your burn is better than mine and better than Campbell's, if it comes

merit is not important in this particular case."

Several drinks. I rather want to celebrate."

"appears to me a very plausible and workmanlike conjecture."

almost shakes me in my own convictions. It is so beautifully simple."

seventeen mile by the high road when a's said an' dune."

==> Dalziel looked a little dashed at this, but Wimsey came to his <==

"Farren told me," he said, "that he had only driven a car two or three
times in his life. He may have got into some difficulty or other.
Suppose he ran out of petrol, or got a blocked feed or something. He

original intention was to find Farren and bring him home--either to
Kirkcudbright or to his own house at Gatehouse. He could then have
explained his black eye as being due to a fall sustained in his search
at Falbae."

==> "But," objected Wimsey, who had been following all this argument with a <==
keenness which his half-drooped eyelids scarcely veiled, "he'd still
have to trundle off to the Minnoch next morning, wouldn't he, old
thing?"

"Yes," said Sir Maxwell, "so he would. But if he had dropped Farren at

if he had taken Farren to Gatehouse, he could then have gone off for the
ostensible purpose of reassuring Mrs. Farren about her husband. When he
was once away, he could always be detained somewhere, by engine-trouble
or what not. I see no great difficulty about that."

==> "All right," said Wimsey. "I pass that. Roll on, thou deep and dark blue <==
ocean, roll."

"Well then, Strachan drove off in search of Farren, leaving Ferguson to
pack the body up and do all the necessary things about the house. And by

would be the one person who might habitually see Campbell having
breakfast and puttering about the house; and what he didn't know from
his own observation he'd be sure to get from Mrs. Green in the course of
her daily gossip."

==> "That's a damned good point, Chief," said Wimsey, with the detached air <==
of an Eton boy applauding a good stroke by a Harrow captain. "Damned
good. Of course, Mrs. Green would be full of information. 'Och, Mr.
Campbell's an awfu' mon wi' his pyjammers. Yesterday he was leavin' them

"I can't say exactly, but the idea would be for Ferguson to drive
Campbell's car up to some suitable spot--say by the old road through
Gatehouse Station to Creetown--and leave it there to be picked up and
taken on by Strachan. Ferguson would then return on a bicycle----"

==> "What bicycle?" said Wimsey. <==

"Any bicycle," retorted the Chief Constable, "except, of course, the
Anwoth Hotel bicycle that we've heard so much about. It's not difficult
to borrow bicycles in these parts, and he would have had plenty of time
to bring it back and leave it where he found it. Ferguson would be back,

agrees with the facts. We have found a man who distinctly remembers
seeing Strachan passing along the Skyre Burn road between 1 o'clock and
1.20. Moreover, we have traced his telephone-call to the McClellan Arms,
and it was put through at 1.18 precisely."

quarter for painting that picture. I had two of the slickest men in the
district working on it, and the quicker painter of the two couldn't get
the result under an hour and a half."

"That's true," said the Chief Constable, grimly, "but he wasn't painting

must ha' passed an awfu' exhaustin' nicht. He was fightin' wi' Mr.
Waters at 9 o'clock or thereabouts, he was fightin' again wi' Mr. Gowan
at 9.45, an' he had his inside fu' o' whuskey forbye, which is weel
known tae be depressin' in its effects--that is," he added hastily,

moment is wore off. Then he's away oot airly in the mornin' wi'oot his
breakfast, as was established by examination o' his insides, an' he
drives his car twenty-seven mile. Wad he no be sufficiently exhausted
wi' a' that tae stiffen up quick when he was killed?"

"Your idea, Duncan, is that Campbell came up to the Minnoch--when,
exactly?"

==> "That's clear enough," said Wimsey. "We've got to take Ferguson's times, <==
because, on this assumption, there's no reason for doubting them.
Starting at 7.30, and driving at an ordinary speed, he wouldn't be
likely to do the twenty-seven miles in much under an hour. Say he
arrives there at 8.30 and sits down and gets his painting things out.
Graham, taking his morning walk, gets along there at, say, 8.45. They

Constable, "and the driver's conspicuous cloak. You can't get away from
them."

galloping fire-engine. You'd been advertising for a Morris car driven by
a man in a loud cloak, with a pile of luggage behind, hadn't you? Well,
you know what happens when you advertise for things. A man sees
something that corresponds to part of the description and imagines the
rest. Probably twenty Morris cars drove over the main road from

At this point the Chief Constable interrupted the reading.

"Could not the call be readily traced at the Kirkcudbright end?" he
inquired.

==> "No, no," said Wimsey, before Macpherson could speak. "Hammond would <==
have been instructed to go somewhere else to get it. A desperate fellow
like Gowan isn't going to take all this trouble only to trip up on a
trifle like a telephone-call, eh, Macpherson?"

"That's so," said the Inspector. "That's jist exactly what was in my

mind."

"Then why did he not tell Hammond what to do when they were together,
and avoid the telephone call altogether?" demanded Sir Maxwell.

==> "He hadn't made his plan then," said Wimsey. "How fretful you people <==
are! Do give the man time to think. His first idea is, 'Let's get the
body away off this road that I'm known to have driven along. I'll plant
it somewhere. I don't know where. I'll think it out and 'phone you

==> "This," said Lord Peter Wimsey, "is the proudest moment of my life. At <==
last I really feel like Sherlock Holmes. A Chief Constable, a Police
Inspector, a Police Sergeant and two constables have appealed to me to
decide between their theories, and with my chest puffed like a

all wrong.'"

passenger, 'You can't be sick here.' You can all be wrong and you are."

"But we've suspected everybody," said Sir Maxwell. "See here, Wimsey,

you even picked out those six artists yourself. Are you going back on

qualify my original statement. You are all wrong, but one of you is less
wrong than the rest. Still none of you has got the right murderer, and
none of you has got the whole of the method right, though some of you
have got bits of it."

a serious side to this matter. If you possess any information that we do
not, you ought to let us have it. In fact, you ought to have let us have
it at once, instead of wasting our time like this."

private person, could do better than any official. But I gave you the
pointer, Dalziel, and you put it into your report. Anybody could have
come to the same conclusion as I did. Why didn't anybody?"

==> "Never mind why we didn't, Wimsey," said Sir Maxwell. "Go on with your <==

"The next thing," said Wimsey, "was--why all this elaborate fake with
the picture? Why should a murderer hang round the place of the crime

objected to the painting expedition to the Minnoch. And I take off my
hat to Sir Maxwell Jamieson for affirming, in the face of all
probability, that Ferguson was the man with the special knowledge to
produce all the right appearances at the cottage to deceive Mrs. Green."

==> There was a short silence when Wimsey had finished this long speech, <==
which he delivered with an unaccustomed sobriety of style, and then Sir
Maxwell said:

"That is all very well, Wimsey, and its sounds very convincing, but
unless you can break down Ferguson's alibi, it goes for nothing at all.

We know that he--or somebody--went from Gatehouse to Dumfries with the

I get through, I will not only prove that the thing is possible but also
that it was done that way."

"Ye canna say fairer than that," said Inspector Macpherson.

==> "The only thing is," said Wimsey, "that we must get Ferguson out of the <==
way. If he sees what we're doing, he'll bolt."

"Let him," said Macpherson, grimly. "If he bolts, we'll ken fine that
he's guilty."

"Let him," said Macpherson, grimly. "If he bolts, we'll ken fine that

heavyish man to be Campbell. All you police blokes are too big. I'm
afraid it will have to be you Sir Maxwell."

"I don't mind," said that stout soldier, gamely, "provided you stop
short at throwing me into the burn."

"Ross and Duncan," he added, "can watch Ferguson. Ye understand.
Whatever place he goes, ye'll shadow him, an' if he tries tae bolt,
ye'll arrest him."

Kirkcudbright after the pubs close, and you'll be waiting at the S-bend
at 9.45. You, Macpherson, can take the observation car and play Gowan's
part in the business, but instead of returning to Kirkcudbright, you
will follow the Chief Constable down to Gatehouse, so as to be ready to
act Strachan's part when the time comes. You, Dalziel, will cling to me

"Hullo!" said Ferguson.

Sergeant Dalziel of Newton-Stewart, whom I fancy you've met before. We
are making a little experiment in connection with Campbell's death and
we want to use your house, if we may. It's a good place to observe from,

A series of heavy thumps testified to Dalziel's conscientious attack on
Campbell's door.

lamp, moved across to the window and drew back the curtain.

shall we do, Fiscal? Play cards or tell stories? Or would you like me to
read aloud to you? Ferguson has a fine collection of detective novels."
He strolled over to the shelves. "Hullo, Ferguson, where's that thing of

I'll take you on at dominoes for ha'penny points. I'm a great dab at

Ferguson took up a book and sat down by the fire. Wimsey produced a box

dropped things and had to pick them up. He walked over to the shelf and
selected a book, then poured out a glass of whiskey and soda. He drank

"Go to bed then."

Ferguson's footsteps passed slowly out of the door and up the stairs.

The hum of a car came down the lane. It drew nearer, louder. The car was

"Can you see it?"

"I'm not looking at it. But I know the sound of the engine."

Dalziel dispatched him to the hotel with a whispered message, and then
went to see what was happening in the yard.

Here he found the Chief Constable extended flat on the ground,

"Is he deid yet?" asked Dalziel sympathetically.

"As mutton," replied the murderer, sadly. "I daresay we ought to have
spun the riot out a bit longer, but the great thing is that he's dead.

the Chief Constable on his back. He carried the inert body into the

"No blood," he said, "thank God there's no blood. I'll do it. I must do

fetch a couple of glasses and the water-jug."

A smothered shout from the garage indicated at this point that the
corpse was growing restive.

==> "All right, corpse," yelled Wimsey, cheerfully, "I'm getting drinks." <==

He fetched the glasses and the water, Dalziel moving doglike at his
heels, and brought the whole consignment back to the garage.

"We'll all have a drink," he said. "Corpse, you may sit up. Now, listen.

He pulled a notebook out of his pocket and began to write. The Chief
Constable and the Sergeant passed the whiskey bottle from hand to hand
and conversed in whispers. Eleven o'clock struck from the church tower.
==> Wimsey went on writing. At a quarter-past eleven, he read his notes <==
through very carefully, and stowed them away in his pocket. After ten
minutes more, he stood up.

"I'm supposed to have made my plans now," he said, "more or less, that
is. Now I've got to start work. I've got to sleep in two beds to-night,

"And the corpse had better stay here. Cheerio, folks. Leave a drink or
two in the bottle for me."

The corpse and the Sergeant stood for a moment at the door and watched
==> Wimsey's dark figure cross the yard. It was dark, but not pitch-dark, <==
and they saw him slip through the door. Presently the light of a candle
flickered in the bedroom. Dalziel moved away, got into the observation
car and started it up.

"Ferguson!"

flickered in the bedroom. Dalziel moved away, got into the observation
car and started it up.

"Ferguson!"

==> Wimsey's voice sounded a little hoarse. Ferguson rose and went to the <==
foot of the stairway.

"Come up here."

Ferguson went up rather reluctantly, and found Wimsey with his shoes

Wimsey's voice sounded a little hoarse. Ferguson rose and went to the
foot of the stairway.

"Come up here."

==> Ferguson went up rather reluctantly, and found Wimsey with his shoes <==
off, and in his shirt-sleeves standing by the bed.

"I'm going to lie down and have a rest. I want you to wait here with me
till something happens."

"This is a silly game."

"It is, rather, I'm afraid. But you'll soon be out of it."

==> Wimsey got into bed and drew the clothes over him. Ferguson took a chair <==
by the window. Presently the noise of an approaching car was heard. It
stopped at the gate, and footsteps passed hurriedly across the yard.

Knock, knock, knock.

stopped at the gate, and footsteps passed hurriedly across the yard.

Knock, knock, knock.

bed and stood close behind Ferguson, almost touching him.

"Look out of window, please."

Ferguson obeyed. A dark form stood on Campbell's threshold. It knocked

"Yes."

"Right. Then you can hop it now, if you want to."

"Yes?"

"Oh, nothing! Good night!"

"Oh, nothing! Good night!"

"Good night."

==> "He nearly told me then," said Wimsey. "Poor devil!" <==

Ferguson went out of the house and out of the gate. Two stealthy shadows
crept out from the hedge and followed him.

Wimsey waited at the window till he saw Dalziel leave the next-door

"He nearly told me then," said Wimsey. "Poor devil!"

Ferguson went out of the house and out of the gate. Two stealthy shadows
crept out from the hedge and followed him.

==> Wimsey waited at the window till he saw Dalziel leave the next-door <==
cottage and carefully lock the door behind him, replacing the key in its
hiding-place. When the hum of the car had died away in the distance, he
ran hastily down the stairs, and across to the garage.

"Corpse!" he cried.

Barrhill. But that absolutely depends on my getting away in good time
from the Minnoch. Let's pray there won't be many people about."

"But ye didna gae tae Barrhill."

==> "No; I think something happened to make me change my mind." Wimsey was <==
busily sorting out crockery. "You'll remember that my over-mastering
necessity is to get to Glasgow somehow. I have announced my intention of
going, and I shall be feeling morbidly nervous about making any change
of plan. If you only knew how my brain is spinning at the moment. There!
there's Campbell's breakfast all laid out ready: tea-pot, cup and

He went swiftly through the motions of changing his garments, while the
police, with satisfaction, examined the grey flannel jacket. Play-acting
was all very well, but this had the appearance of solid evidence.

==> Presently Wimsey indicated that the change of clothes was supposed to be <==
accomplished.

"I am spending the night in Glasgow," he went on, "so I must pack an
attachÃ©-case. Here it is. Clean pyjamas, shaving-tackle, toothbrush.
Better shave now, to save time. Five minutes for a shave. In they go.

odds are that if it isn't down one close it'll be down the next. Put out
the lights. Lock both doors and take the keys away. We can't risk any
more Strachans paying visits while we're away."

==> Suiting the action to the words, Wimsey left the cottages and walked <==
briskly away down the road, closely followed by his observers. "I told
you there'd be walking exercise," said Wimsey. "You people had better
take the car. I shall have the bike to come back on."

As the cortÃªge arrived opposite the Anwoth Hotel, a bulky form came

"He's in there, all right," said P.C. Ross. "Duncan's watching the other
entrance and we've got the Gatehouse policeman sittin' in the back
garden tae see that he doesna' get oot by the windows. Here's your
bicycle, my lord."

==> "Wonderful!" said Wimsey. "Hit it the very first shot. Anybody'd think <==
it had been left there on purpose. No"--as the constable obligingly
struck a match. "No lights. I'm supposed to be stealing this, my dear
man. Good night--or rather, good morning. Wish us luck."

It was a little after two when Wimsey got back to the cottages with the

The Chief Constable, being an old soldier, slept promptly and soundly.
He was awakened a little before five by a clashing of pots and pans.

voice in his ear. "I am going up to finish off the bedrooms."

At a quarter past five this job was finished, Campbell's toothbrush and
shaving-brush and both sets of soap and towels left wet and the proper
appearances produced. Wimsey then came in to cook and eat his solitary

but you'd have been so uncomfortable. Come and take up your pose again,

"This may be fun to you," grumbled Sir Maxwell, "but it's death to me."

"Eh!" said Macpherson, as Wimsey seized the Chief Constable's cramped
and reluctant body and swung it into the back seat of the Morris, "but
your lordship's wonderful strong for your size."

between the seat and the floor. "I hope you aren't permanently damaged,

"Carry on," said the corpse, in a muffled voice.

between the seat and the floor. "I hope you aren't permanently damaged,

"Carry on," said the corpse, in a muffled voice.

==> Wimsey slung in the painting outfit--stool, satchel and easel--followed <==
it with Campbell's cloak and hat, and piled the bicycle on top, securing
it with a tow-rope which he produced from a corner of the garage, and
tucking a large rug round and over his awkward load.

"We'll let the easel stick out a bit," he remarked. "It looks innocent

The little cottage by the level crossing seemed still asleep and the
gates stood open. The cars passed over the line and, avoiding the
station entrance, turned sharp away to the left, along the old road to
Creetown. Here, for some distance, the way was flanked on either side by
a stone wall, but, after a few hundred yards, the walls came to a stop.
==> Wimsey held up a warning hand, stopped, turned his car, with some <==
bumping, over the grass, and drove it well behind the shelter of the
wall on the left. The police-car halted in the middle of the road.

"What noo?" asked Macpherson.

bumping, over the grass, and drove it well behind the shelter of the
wall on the left. The police-car halted in the middle of the road.

"Still alive, Sir Maxwell?"

"Only just."

have a smoke."

"And what do the others do?"

==> "They walk back with me to Gatehouse," said Wimsey, with a grim smile. <==

"Mayn't we bring the car?" said Macpherson, mournfully.

"You can if you like, but it would be more sporting to cheer me with a
little pleasant conversation. Damn it! I've _got_ to walk."

[line number in individual story] matching line = 12715    window = 12710 12720

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 59963    window = 59958 59968


little pleasant conversation. Damn it! I've _got_ to walk."

Eventually it was arranged that Macpherson should walk with Lord Peter,
while Dalziel brought the car along behind in case the station-omnibus
proved to be crowded. Telling the Fiscal to see that the corpse behaved
==> itself, Wimsey waved a cheerful hand and started off with Macpherson to <==
trudge the six-and-a-half miles back to Gatehouse.

The last mile was the most awkward, for the road was getting busy, and
they had to be continually diving over walls and under hedges to avoid
observation. At the last moment they were nearly caught in the lane by

they had to be continually diving over walls and under hedges to avoid
observation. At the last moment they were nearly caught in the lane by
the paper-boy, who passed, whistling, within a foot of them while they
crouched behind a convenient hawthorn-bush.

==> "Damn the paper-boy," said Wimsey. "Ferguson, of course, would have been <==
expecting him. In any case, he probably did all this earlier, but I
didn't want to keep the corpse out all night. A quarter to eight. We've
cut it rather fine. Never mind. Here goes."

They took the remainder of the lane at a run, unlocked Campbell's door,

cut it rather fine. Never mind. Here goes."

They took the remainder of the lane at a run, unlocked Campbell's door,
hid the key, performed the motions of taking in the milk and emptying
part of it down the sink, took in and opened letters and newspapers, and
==> dashed back to Ferguson's cottage. Here Wimsey took in Ferguson's milk, <==
boiled his egg and made his tea, and sat down to his breakfast with an
air of simple enjoyment.

At 8 o'clock, the rotund form of Mrs. Green was seen waddling down the
lane. Wimsey looked out of the window and waved a friendly hand to her.

place, she'll have a fit."

Macpherson hurried out, and was seen to vanish into the next-door

cottage with Mrs. Green. Presently he returned, smiling broadly.

"Verra gude, my lord," he said, "she's tellt me it a' luiks fine; jist
precisely as it did the mornin' Campbell was missin'."

==> "Good," said Wimsey. He finished his breakfast, packed the burberry into <==
the attachÃ©-case, and made a tour of inspection round the house, to make
sure that nothing looked suspicious. With the exception of the
mysterious remains of four extra breakfasts in the kitchen, everything
seemed normal. He strolled out, met Mrs. Green in the front of the
cottages, had a word with her, mentioned that he was catching the

cottages, had a word with her, mentioned that he was catching the
station 'bus and strolled down to the end of the lane.

Shortly after 8.30, the pant of the omnibus was heard coming along the
==> road. Wimsey flagged it and got in. The police car followed on behind, <==
much to the interest of the other passengers in the omnibus.

At 9 o'clock, or a little after, 'bus and car drew up in the station
yard. Wimsey alighted and came across to the car.

Inspector at his heels. He spoke to the station-master and booking-clerk
and bought a first-class return to Glasgow. After a few minutes, the
train was signalled, and a general exodus took place to the opposite
platform. The station-master marched across, carrying the staff under
his arm; the signalman came down from his lofty perch and crossed also,

his arm; the signalman came down from his lofty perch and crossed also,
to perform the duties of a porter. The passengers from the 'bus streamed
across the line, followed by the 'bus-conductor on the look-out for
return passengers with parcels. The booking-clerk retired into his

the other passengers.

The train came in. Wimsey wrung the Inspector's hand affectionately, as
though he were not going to see him again for a month, and stepped into
the first-class compartment which the porter was holding open for him.

The corpse was repacked into the car. Wimsey put on Campbell's hat and
cloak, again wrapping a muffler closely about his chin so that very
little of his features was visible beneath the flapping black brim. He
backed the car out on to the road and drove gently away towards

deal worn. A puncture would have been fatal. He kept his speed down to a
cautious twenty miles an hour. He thought as he drove how maddening this
slow progress must have been to Ferguson, to whom time had been so

meander beneath a clump of trees. The sun was growing stronger.

Between twenty and twenty-five minutes past nine they came down at the
head of the steep little plunge into Creetown, opposite the clock-tower.
==> Wimsey swung the car out to the right into the main road, and <==
encountered the astonished gaze of the proprietor of the Ellangowan
Hotel, who was talking to a motorist by the petrol-pump. For a moment he
stared as though he had seen a ghost--then he caught sight of Macpherson
and Dalziel, following in the second car with the Fiscal, and waved his
hand with an understanding smile.

Ferguson shouldn't have been seen at this point--especially as he would
quite probably have liked to be seen. But that's life. If you want a
thing, you don't get it."

He pressed his foot on the accelerator and took the road at a good

Five miles farther on, he passed the turn to the New Galloway road. It
was just after half-past nine.

==> "Near enough," said Wimsey to himself. He kept his foot down and hurried <==
along over the fine new non-skid surface which had just been laid down
and was rapidly making the road from Creetown to Newton-Stewart one of
the safest and finest in the three kingdoms. Just outside
Newton-Stewart, he had to slow down to pass the road-engine and workers,
the road-laying having now advanced to that point. After a brief delay,

right-hand turn and he saw his goal before him--the bridge, the rusty
iron gate, and the steep granite wall that overhung the Minnoch.

He ran the car up upon the grass and got out. The police-car drew up
into the shelter of a little quarry on the opposite side of the road.
==> When the observers came up with him, Wimsey was already rolling back the <==
rug and pulling out the bicycle.

"Ye've made verra gude time," observed the Inspector. "It's jist on 10

"Ye've made verra gude time," observed the Inspector. "It's jist on 10

==> Wimsey nodded. He ran up on to the higher ground and surveyed the road <==
and the hills to left and right. Not a soul was to be seen--not so much
as a cow or a sheep. Though they were only just off a main road and a
few hundred yards from a farm, the place was as still and secret as the
heart of a desert. He ran down again to the car, flung the painting-kit
upon the grass, opened the door of the tonneau and clutched ruthlessly

few hundred yards from a farm, the place was as still and secret as the
heart of a desert. He ran down again to the car, flung the painting-kit
upon the grass, opened the door of the tonneau and clutched ruthlessly
the huddled form of the Chief Constable, who, more dead than alive after
his disagreeable journey, hardly needed to feign the stiffness which was

he made the last lurching stage of his progress, to be dumped with a
heavy thud on the hard granite, at the edge of the incline.

"Wait there," said Wimsey, in a menacing tone, "and don't move, or
you'll fall into the river."

The Chief Constable dug his fingers into a bunch of heather and prayed

The Chief Constable dug his fingers into a bunch of heather and prayed

enveloped in a musty smother of rug. Then came another pause, and the
sound of voices and heartless laughter. Then he was deserted again. He

was secreting the bicycle somewhere. Then the voices came back, and a
few muttered curses suggested that somebody was setting up an easel with
unpractised hands. More laughter. Then the rug was twitched from his
head and Wimsey's voice announced, "You can come out now."

Sir Maxwell retreated cautiously on hands and knees from the precipice,
which, to his prejudiced eyes, appeared to be about two hundred feet in
depth, rolled over and sat up.

"Oh, God!" he said, rubbing his legs. "What have I done to deserve all
this?"

==> "I'm sorry, sir," said Wimsey. "If you had been really dead, you know, <==
you wouldn't have noticed it. But I didn't like to go as far as that.
Well, now we've got an hour and a half. I ought to paint the picture,
but, as that is beyond me, I thought we might have a little picnic.
There's some grub in the other car. They're just bringing it up."

"You shall have it. Hullo! Somebody's coming. We'll give them a start.
Get under the rug again, sir."

The distant clack of a farm-lorry was making itself heard in the
distance. The Chief Constable hurriedly snatched up the rug and froze.
==> Wimsey sat down before the easel and assumed brush and palette. <==

Presently the lorry loomed into sight over the bridge. The driver,
glancing across with natural interest at the spot where the tragedy had
taken place, suddenly caught sight of the easel, the black hat and the
conspicuous cloak. He gave vent to one fearful yell and rammed his foot

laughed. The Chief Constable sprang up to see what was happening and
laughed too. In a few minutes the rest of the party joined them, so
agitated with laughter that they could scarcely hold the parcels they
were carrying.

The picnic was a cheerful one, though it was a little disturbed by the
return of Jock, supported by a number of friends, to view the phenomenon
of a ghost in broad daylight.

Sergeant Dalziel grunted, and strode down to warn the spectators off,
his stalwart jaws still champing a wedge of veal and ham pie. The hills
returned to their wonted quiet.

"Corpse-time," he said. "Here, Sir Maxwell, is the moment when you go

"Is it?" said the Chief Constable. "I draw the line there."

"Well, we'll suppose it done. Pack up, you languid aristocrats, and
return to your Rolls-Royce, while I pant and sweat upon this confounded
bicycle. We had better take away the Morris and the rest of the doings.
There's no point in leaving them."

furiously away. The others packed themselves at leisure into the two
cars. The procession wound out upon the Bargrennan road.

Nine and a half miles of crawling in the wake of the bicycle brought
==> them to Barrhill. Just outside the village, Wimsey signalled a halt. <==

"Look here," said he. "Here's where I have to guess. I guess that
Ferguson meant to catch the 12.35 here, but something went wrong. It's
12.33 now, and I could just do it. The station is just down that
side-road there. But he must have started late and missed it. I don't

know why. Listen! There she comes!"

As he spoke, the smoke of the train came in view. They heard her draw up
into the station. Then, in a few minutes, she panted away again.

==> "Well on time," said Wimsey. "Anyway, we've missed her now. She's a <==
local as far as Girvan. Then she turns into an express, only stopping at
Maybole before she gets to Ayr. Then she becomes still more exalted by
the addition of a Pullman Restaurant Car, and scorns the earth, running
right through to Paisley and Glasgow. Our position is fairly hopeless,
you see. We can only carry on through the village and wait for a

miracle."

He remounted and pedalled on, glancing back from time to time over his
shoulder. Presently, the sound of an overtaking car made itself heard.
An old Daimler limousine packed with cardboard dress-boxes, purred past
==> at a moderate twenty-two or three miles an hour. Wimsey let it pass him, <==
then, head down and legs violently at work swung in behind it. In
another moment, his hand was on the ledge of the rear window, and he was
free-wheeling easily in its wake. The driver did not turn his head.

"A-ah!" said Macpherson. "It's our friend Clarence Gordon, by Jove! And

Clarence Gordon was a careful driver, but acted nobly up to expectation.
He positively put on a spurt after passing Pinwherry, and as they
attacked the sharp rise to Pinmore, they caught sight of the black
hinder-end of the train labouring along the track that ran parallel and
close to the road. As they topped the hill, and left the train behind
==> them, Wimsey waved his hat. They span merrily along, bearing to the left <==
and winding down towards the sea. At five minutes past one, the first
houses of Girvan rose about them. The pursuers' hearts beat furiously as
the train now caught them up again on their right and rushed past them
towards Girvan Station. At the end of the town, Wimsey let go his hold
on the car, sprinting away for dear life to the right down the station

unstrapping the attachÃ©-case and heard him cry to the porter in an
exaggerated Oxford accent: "Heah! portah! label this bicycle for Ayr."
And as he turned away from the booking-window, the porter's urgent voice
came right in his ear:

They tumbled out on to the platform. The bicycle was being bundled into
the rear van. They leapt for their carriage. The whistle blew. They were
off.

==> "Gosh!" said Wimsey, wiping his face. And then: "Damn this thing, it's <==
like a fly-paper."

In his left hand, concealed by the hat which he had removed for the sake
of coolness, he held something which he now displayed with a grin. It
was a luggage-label for Euston.

handsomely on the L.M.S. Fortunately the pigeon-hole was labelled, so I
didn't have to hunt for it. Well, that's that. Now we can take a
breather. There's nothing else till we get to Ayr."

After a stop at Maybole to collect the tickets, the train ran merrily
==> along to Ayr. Almost before it drew up at the platform, Wimsey was out <==
of the train. He ran back to the rear van, with Macpherson hurrying at
his heels.

"Let me have that bicycle out, quick," he said to the guard. "You'll see
it there. Labelled to Ayr. Here's the ticket."

"It's a' richt, guard," said Macpherson. "I'm a police officer. Let this

ought to be sorry to see the net closing round this poor Mr. Ferguson,
but I must admit that I find myself a prey to excitement."

==> "Yes--I'm sorry for Ferguson too," answered Wimsey. "I wish you hadn't <==
reminded me, sir. But it can't be helped. I'd be sorrier still if it was
Farren, for instance. Poor beggar! This business will tie him by the leg
for ever, I'm afraid. Opportunity doesn't come twice. No; the only thing
that's really worrying me is the possibility of this train's getting in
late."

for ever, I'm afraid. Opportunity doesn't come twice. No; the only thing
that's really worrying me is the possibility of this train's getting in
late."

The train, however, ran most creditably to time, and drew into St. Enoch
==> at 2.55 to the minute. Wimsey was out of it at once and led his party <==
along the platform at a great pace.

As they passed the entrance to the station hotel, he turned to Sir
Maxwell.

their party. They were probably just emerging from their lunch, and he
guessed that their friends had come along to meet their train at
Glasgow."

He broke off to wave frantically to a taxi. The whole five of them
==> crammed into it, and Wimsey directed the driver to set him down in the <==
street where Messrs. Sparkes & Crisp had their show-rooms.

"And drive like blazes," he added.

At five minutes past three he tapped on the glass. The driver pulled up

street where Messrs. Sparkes & Crisp had their show-rooms.

"And drive like blazes," he added.

At five minutes past three he tapped on the glass. The driver pulled up
==> and they all scrambled out on to the pavement. Wimsey paid off the taxi <==
and headed off at a brisk pace for the motor show-rooms a few yards
away.

"Don't let's all go in in a bunch," he said. "Come with me, Sir Maxwell,
and the others can drift in afterwards."

rival merit of two different brands of shock-absorber. Through an
archway appeared a glittering array of motor-cycles and side-cars. A
frosted-glass door on the left appeared to lead to an inner office.

==> Wimsey darted silently in with Sir Maxwell and disappeared behind a <==
show-case. The lad and the customer continued their discussion. After
about a minute, Wimsey emerged again and strode wrathfully to the

"Very sorry, sir. What can I do for you?"

"Will you come this way, sir?"

Wimsey, attaching his party to him with a glance, plunged through the

"Yes--exactly. Our fellows at the shops reported a defect in the
armature winding. Quite. I hope it is quite O.K. now, Mr.--er----"

"Oh, absolutely," said Mr. Saunders. "Quite so. You're very well, I

"By Jove, was it? Well, I thought it must have been somewhere about
three or a little after. What a memory you've got, Miss Madden."

Miss Madden smiled faintly.

==> "There you are, Inspector," said Wimsey. "Difference between five <==
minutes to and five minutes past. All the difference, isn't it?"

"Ye may have tae swear tae this in a court of law, Mr. Saunders," said
the Inspector, sourly. "So I'll trouble ye no tae forget it again."

The investigators were shown out by Mr. Saunders, who burbled
unconvincingly all down the passage.

"It's not much good questioning this fellow Birkett, I suppose," said
Sir Maxwell. "He probably spoke in perfect good faith. He'd be ready to
==> swear to-day that he'd kept you waiting, Wimsey." <==

"Probably. Well, now, we've got to be up at the Exhibition at four. Not
much time. However, I noticed a jobbing printer's on the way up here. I
daresay we shall find what we want there."

"Verra gude." The foreman went to a case of type, extracted the required
letters and figures and wrapped them up in a screw of paper, mentioning
a small price.

==> Wimsey paid for them and put the little parcel in his pocket. <==

"By the way," he said, "did you have a gentleman in here, asking for the
same thing, a fortnight ago?"

"No, sir. I wad mind it weel eneugh. Na, na, it wad be a rather uncommon

Dalziel departed on this errand, while the rest took a taxi and hurried
away to the Exhibition, which they reached a few minutes before four.
Here they dallied till half-past four, making a hasty tour of all the
rooms, and noting one or two striking pictures in each.

==> "There," said Wimsey, as they passed the turnstile again. "Now, if we <==
were to meet any inquisitive friends on the doorway, we could persuade
them that we had visited the whole show and used our brains. And now we
had better make tracks for a quiet place. I suggest a hotel bedroom."

                           LORD PETER WIMSEY

==> In a remote bedroom in one of Glasgow's principal hotels, Wimsey <==
unwrapped his little parcel of types, together with Ferguson's
safety-razor, and a small hammer, which he had purchased on the way.

Then, gathering his audience about him, he brought out from his pocket
the outward half of his first-class ticket from Gatehouse to Glasgow.

[line number in individual story] matching line = 13417    window = 13412 13422

figure in relief on the reverse.

"Eh, mon!" exclaimed Macpherson, "but ye're ower clever tae be an honest
mon."

==> Wimsey added the figure 3 and an A, taking care to keep the feet of the <==
letters parallel--a task easily accomplished by setting the beard of the
type in line with the edge of the pasteboard. Then, with careful
attention to spacing and uprightness, he punched in the letters LMS over
the 23A. This completed the Mauchline punch-mark. In a third place he
forged the

pass on a casual inspection. Now, there's only one thing to do, and that
is, to get it back into the hands of the railway-company. I'd better
take only one witness to this. We don't want to create a sensation."

The Inspector was chosen to accompany him, and, taking a taxi, they
==> bustled down to St. Enoch Station. Here Wimsey inquired, in a fussy <==
manner, for the collector who had been on duty when the 2.16 came in
from Dumfries. The man was pointed out to him at one of the barriers.
Wimsey, wreathing his features into a kind of peevish smile, approached
him with an air of worried kindliness.

bustled down to St. Enoch Station. Here Wimsey inquired, in a fussy
manner, for the collector who had been on duty when the 2.16 came in
from Dumfries. The man was pointed out to him at one of the barriers.
==> Wimsey, wreathing his features into a kind of peevish smile, approached <==
him with an air of worried kindliness.

"Oh, good evening. I think you were at the barrier when I came in on the
2.16 this afternoon. Now, do you know that you let me get past without
giving up my ticket? Yes, yes, he-he! I might have been defrauding the

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 60720    window = 60715 60725



The ticket-collector, now thoroughly alarmed, excused himself, stammered
and then let out the whole story.

He had been on duty just about this time exactly a fortnight earlier. A
==> gentleman had come, just as Wimsey had done, and produced a ticket, <==
explaining that he had somehow slipped through the barrier without
having to give it up. He (the collector) had examined the ticket, and
seen that it had been properly clipped at Maxwell town, Hurlford and
Mauchline, and he had seen no reason to doubt the passenger's story. Not
wishing to be reprimanded for negligence, he had thanked the gentleman,

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 60767    window = 60762 60772


to ascertain that the ticket had actually reached Glasgow, and therefore
no special attention was paid to the punch-marks. Now, however, it was
evident enough that the punch-marks were forgeries, very neatly
executed.

==> On their return to the hotel, Wimsey and the Inspector were met by <==
Dalziel, with additional confirmation. A man corresponding to Ferguson's
description had, on the Tuesday in question, visited a firm that sold
book-binders' tools, and purchased a set of letter-punches, similar in
character and size to the letter on the tickets. He had explained that
he was doing a little amateur book-binding, and wanted the punches for

3 and 4--this series containing all the letters and numbers necessary
for faking the ticket-punches. The case against Ferguson was complete.

Campbell at any price. I rather wish----"

"Can't be helped, Wimsey," said the Chief Constable. "Murder is murder,

"It was bad luck, of course, that the body was found quite so soon. I
knew there might be trouble over that rigor mortis business. Was that
what put you on to the idea of murder in the first place?"

Did you realise that you had carried off Campbell's flake-white?"

"I didn't notice it till I got back home. But it never occurred to me
that anybody would spot that. I suppose you were the intelligent sleuth,
Wimsey. I'd have taken it up to the Minnoch and dropped it somewhere,

first real fright I got. But afterwards I thought I could rely on the
alibi. I was rather proud of that ticket-forgery. And I hoped you would
overlook the possibilities of Ikey-Mo."

apparently I wasn't.

"I'm sorry. I didn't mean to kill Campbell. And I still say, and say
again, it was not murder."

==> Wimsey got up. <==

"Look here, Ferguson," he said. "I'm damned sorry, and I always thought
it couldn't really be murder. Will you forgive me?"

"I'm glad," said Ferguson. "I've felt like hell ever since. I'd really

"I'm glad," said Ferguson. "I've felt like hell ever since. I'd really
rather stand my trial. I'd like to tell everybody that it wasn't murder.
You do believe that, don't you?"

As he clattered down the close, picking his way past the conglomeration
of bicycles which almost blocked the entrance, Wimsey perceived this
efficient person waiting upon the doorstep with an expression which,
though strictly controlled, might almost have been called eager.

==> "Hullo, Bunter!" said his lordship, cheerfully. "What's for dinner? I'm <==
feeling uncommonly ready for it. There's a beautiful corpse up at
Creetown."

"I apprehended, my lord, that your lordship would be engaged in
investigation. Not being certain of the exact hour of your lordship's

"Thank you, my lord. I understand from the butcher that the portion of
the animal which I have been accustomed to call shin of beef is termed
in these parts the--er--hough."

==> "I believe you are right, Bunter." <==

"I did not take the man's word for it," said Bunter, with melancholy
dignity. "I inspected the carcase and ascertained that the correct cut
was removed from it."

"I believe you are right, Bunter."

==> "I did not take the man's word for it," said Bunter, with melancholy <==
dignity. "I inspected the carcase and ascertained that the correct cut
was removed from it."

"You are always so thorough," said Wimsey, appreciatively.

"You are always so thorough," said Wimsey, appreciatively.

"I do my best, my lord. Would your lordship desire me to refer to the
comestible as--er--hough--during our residence in this country?"

==> "It would be a graceful concession to national feeling Bunter, if you <==
can bring yourself to do it."

"Very good, my lord. I presume that the leg of mutton will again pass
under the appellation of jiggot, as on the occasion of your lordship's
previous visit?"

"Very good, my lord. I presume that the leg of mutton will again pass

previous visit?"

"Yes, my lord." Bunter sighed deeply. "Whatever is correct I will
endeavour to do to your lordship's satisfaction."

"Thank you, Bunter. We must try to be correct under all circumstances."

potatoes are ready."

"Right-ho!" said his lordship. "I'll just run across the close and have

"Oh--I was only speaking generally. He was home to dinner all right."

"And then barged out afterwards, saying he wanted some Gold Flakes and
would be back in ten minutes, I suppose. It's disheartening, isn't it,
the way we behave. I'm a shocking offender myself, though my conscience
==> is fairly easy. After all, Bunter is paid to put up with me. It's not as <==
though I had a devoted wife warming my slippers and looking out of the
front-door every five minutes to see if I'm going to turn up."

Mrs. Farren drew in her breath sharply.

eggs and bacon, which was received with an "Ay, imph'm" of the driest
kind. There had been no further news from Dalziel, and he went home,
first calling across the way, only to ascertain that Waters had not yet
returned.

==> Bunter received him with respectful welcome, but appeared to have <==
something preying on his mind. On inquiry, however, this turned out to
be merely the discovery that the Scotch were so lost to all sense of
propriety as to call a dish an "ashet"--obviously with the deliberate
intention of confusing foreigners and making them feel like bulls in
china-shops.

china-shops.

==> Wimsey sympathised and, to take Bunter's mind off this mortifying <==
experience, mentioned his meeting with Jock Graham.

"Indeed, my lord? I was already apprised of Mr. Graham's reappearance. I
understand, my lord, that he was in Creetown on Monday night."

"Was he, by Jove? How do you know?"

==> Bunter coughed. <==

"After the interview with the young person at the china-shop, my lord, I
stepped for a few moments into the McClellan Arms. Not into the public
bar, my lord, but into the bar-parlour adjacent. While there, I
accidentally overheard some persons mention the circumstance in the

"No, my lord, but, from the circumstance that they alluded to the number
of drinks he consumed, I apprehend that it would be before
closing-time."

"Ah!" said Wimsey. "An inquiry among the Creetown pubs might settle
==> that. Very well, Bunter. I think I shall go out and clear my wits with a <==
round of golf this afternoon. And I'll have a grilled steak and chips at
7.30."

"Very good, my lord."

rather angular, rather handsome in an uncompromising kind of way and
painted rather good, strong, angular and handsome figure-studies in
oils. Miss Cochran was round, cheerful, humorous and grey-haired; she
illustrated magazine stories in line and wash. Wimsey liked them both,
because they had no nonsense about them, and they liked him for the same
==> reason, and also because they found Bunter extremely amusing. Bunter was <==
always distressed to see them cooking their own dinners and putting up

The ladies replied that they were quite well-fed, but a little

a bottle of claret and the remains of the rhubarb-tart to be brought

"Well, you've missed all the excitement."

"So they told us at the station," said Miss Cochran. "What is it all
about? Is it true that Mr. Campbell is dead?"

"How sensible you are," said Wimsey, "and how imperturbable. Calm
without something or other, without o'er-flowing, full. Talking of that,
how soon will the pubs be open? Hullo! here's another bunch of hair.

I've a notion it may interest him."

"Ye think so?" said Macpherson. "Weel, that's no a bad idea, neither.

"Dad, you are dreadful," said Miss Anderson.

I expect he has. He remembers everything. Did you decide to send one
from the Club, Strachan?"

flannel suit and sent to attend Campbell's funeral in a black

then gone straight on to Bob Anderson's, he had not seen Bunter again

moonlight, because there is no moon; in fact, it's beastly dark and I
fell over some confounded steps, but the principle is the same and have
you got any arnica?"

"My lord, I have already taken upon me, in your lordship's absence, to

Carlisle. If your lordship will kindly remove your garments, I will

that she was to receive permission to spend this evening out. I invited
her to attend the cinematograph entertainment in my company. The film
was one which I had already seen in London, but to her it was a novelty

"No doubt," said Wimsey.

"During the course of the performance I contrived to render our
relations somewhat more confidential."

==> "Bunter! Bunter!" <==

"Your lordship need be under no apprehension. In short, the young person
confessed to me that she had some cause for dissatisfaction with her
present situation. Mr. Gowan was kind, and Mrs. Alcock was kind and so
was Mr. Alcock, but during the last few days certain circumstances had

certainty was preferable to agitating suspicions. She got up, crept
cautiously past the bedroom of the two Alcocks and went up to the top of
the house again. She ventured a little way down the corridor, when she
was rooted to the spot by the sound of a hollow groan."

==> "Really, Bunter," said Wimsey, "your narrative style would do credit to <==
the _Castle of Otranto_."

"Thank you, my lord. I am only acquainted by repute with the work you
mention, but I understand that it enjoyed a considerable vogue in its
day. The girl Elizabeth was hesitating whether to shriek or to run away,

Thinking that the sound would awaken the Alcocks, she was preparing to
retreat once more to the shelter of the broom-cupboard, when the door at
the end of the passage was opened in a stealthy manner and a terrible
face looked out at her."

==> Bunter appeared to be enjoying the sensation he was producing, and <==
paused.

"A terrible face," said Wimsey. "Very well, I've got that. A terrible
face. Next, please!"

paused.

"A terrible face," said Wimsey. "Very well, I've got that. A terrible
face. Next, please!"

==> "The face, as I understand," pursued Bunter, "was enveloped in <==
grave-clothes. The jaws were closely bound up, the features were hideous
and the lips writhed away from the protruding teeth and the apparition
was of a ghastly pallor."

"Look here, Bunter," said Wimsey, "could you not cut out some of the

observations was that of a dark-haired, clean-shaven man with protruding

person was about to take a surreptitious departure from Mr. Gowan's
residence, and that Elizabeth had been given a night's leave of absence
in order that she might not be a witness of the proceedings."

==> "I think the inference is justifiable, Bunter." <==

"Yes, my lord. I took the liberty of concealing myself at the corner of
the street contiguous to Mr. Gowan's house where the little flight of
steps leads down to the river. Presently a tall figure, closely muffled
in a scarf and overcoat with the hat pulled well down to conceal the

but that he had remained concealed in his own house in attendance upon
the sick person observed by Elizabeth."

"Curiouser and curiouser," said Wimsey.

==> "I returned here," pursued Bunter, "and consulted the local time-table. <==
I found that there was a train leaving Dumfries for Carlisle and the
South at two minutes past midnight. It appeared conceivable that Mr.
Gowan was intending to catch it either at Dumfries or at
Castle-Douglas."

Wimsey suddenly uttered a loud yelp.

are! And now I suppose that damned photograph has been circulated all

He drew out his notebook and handed the bunch of curly black hair to

"My lord," said the latter, reproachfully, "it is most regrettable that
I did not see this before. Without presuming to speak as an expert, I
may say that on several occasions I had the opportunity of examining the
beard of a person belonging to the Mohammedan persuasion. You are

doubtless aware, my lord, that the strict followers of this sect
consider it unlawful to trim the hair of the face, with the consequence
that the beard is extremely silky in texture, each hair preserving the
natural tapering point."

"Your lordship has doubtless observed," pursued Bunter, "that this
specimen conforms in every particular to this description, and having
seen Mr. Gowan's beard, I do not hesitate to give it as my personal
opinion--subject to expert correction--that Mr. Gowan will now be found

"Now we know who the mysterious stranger was, and what he was suffering
from. You'll have to revise your time-scheme, Inspector, and put Gowan
in the leading rÃ´le."

"We'll catch him by his nose," said the Inspector, without the slightest
humorous intention. He bustled away.

novel, in which everything happens just too late to prevent the story
from coming to a premature happy ending."

"Yes, my lord."

"Yes, my lord."

theory, and apparently lets out Farren."

"Quite so, my lord."

"And unless your friend Betty is lying, it lets out Gowan too."

the engine. The muffled-up person who had got in was Alcock himself.
Certainly the Inspector could see Mr. Gowan's letter. Here it was,
written from Mr. Gowan's club, the Mahlstick, on the club's own paper,
and posted in London on the Wednesday.

==> As for Bunter's story, Alcock denied it altogether. The girl Betty was a <==
foolish and hysterical young person, who imagined a great deal of
nonsense. It was perfectly true that Mrs. Alcock had forbidden her to go
into the disused part of the house. Betty was a great deal too fond of
wasting her time. There were a lot of old magazines kept up there in a
box-room, and the girl was always sneaking in there to read them when

would show the dog to the police if they cared to call. As for the
alleged apparition on Wednesday morning, it was quite obvious that the
girl had merely been suffering from nightmare, due to her own ridiculous
fancies about corpses. There was no sick person there and never had
been. Mr. Gowan had left Kirkcudbright, as previously stated, by car on
==> Monday evening to catch the 8.45. The person whom Bunter had seen <==
entering the car on the Thursday night had been Alcock. Hammond and Mrs.
Alcock could confirm all this.

They could, and did, confirm it. The injured dog was produced and found
to be actually suffering from a nasty sore in the leg, and Betty, when

odd--why, having faked the murder, he didn't disarm suspicion by showing
himself openly in Kirkcudbright."

"Ay," said Macpherson, excitedly, "but dinna ye see it explains naething
at a'? It disna fit the description o' the man in the grey suit that tuk

spare brushes hung on there--even my palette is always made up in the
same order, though not always with the same colours, of course. But,
roughly speaking, it follows the order of the spectrum."

"I see," said Wimsey. "I'm not methodical myself, but I do admire

him to find all kinds of odds and ends bulging my pockets or chucked
helter-skelter into the collar-drawer."

we have enough evidence tae arrest him?"

Parker turned this over carefully.

"Weel, noo, Mr. Parker," said the Inspector, deferentially, "do ye think
we have enough evidence tae arrest him?"

==> Parker turned this over carefully. <==

"I take it," he said, "that your idea is that Gowan met this man
Campbell in the road between Gatehouse and Kirkcudbright and killed him
in a quarrel. Then he got frightened and decided to fake up the
accident. His first step was to cut off his own very conspicuous beard,

he no tak' the corp back wi' him? It was verra weel understandable when
we supposed that the murderer was Farren in Strachan's car, because we
had the theory that he meant at first tae pit the blame on Strachan, but
what for should Gowan du sic a fulish thing?"

==> "Well, let's see," said Parker. "He had to get Campbell's car back <==
somehow. Ferguson might have noticed if the wrong car came in. But he
didn't take the body with him on that journey, because, again, Ferguson
or somebody might have spotted him with it. Gowan's car was a
two-seater. Perhaps the dickey wasn't big enough to hide the corpse
properly. He decides that it's better to risk leaving the corpse and his

rabbity-faced fellow in the train fra' Castle-Douglas tae Euston. An'
hoo aboot yon man that came knockin' on Campbell's door o' Monday
midnicht?"

==> Parker rubbed his jaw thoughtfully. <==

"It's funny about the description of the man," he said. "Perhaps Gowan
contrived to disguise himself in some way, with a false fair moustache,
or something. And the girl's story may, as Alcock suggests, be partly
imagination. Gowan may have returned to Kirkcudbright on Tuesday

who knocked at midnight _was_ somebody different altogether."

"But," said the Inspector, "if that man gaed into the hoose and found
Campbell dead and Gowan there, why hasna he come forward tae say so?"

==> "Possibly he was after no good," suggested Parker. "He may, as you <==
previously remarked, have been a lady. Still, I admit that there are
awkward gaps in the story. I think we'd better get on the tracks of
Gowan and the rabbity man separately, and try to find out definitely
which way Gowan really went. And when we do catch Gowan, I think perhaps
we'd better not arrest him, but merely detain him on the ground that he

"There's nae ither _artist_ wi' a black beard like yon," said
Macpherson, stubbornly. "Not in a' the district."

==> "Hell! yes," said Parker. "He's got to be an artist, of course. Well, <==
anyhow, we'll detain Gowan."

Inspector Macpherson thanked him.

"And now there's this man Farren," went on Parker. "Do you want him too?

Inspector Macpherson thanked him.

Supposing he's not down a mine."

"I'm thinkin' he did ought tae be found," said the Inspector. "He was
heard tae utter threats--an' forbye, he's disappeared, which in itself
is distressin' tae his family an' friends."

How about him?"

"I'd forgot Waters," replied Macpherson, frankly. "I canna see how he
comes intae 't at a'."

==> "Nor do I," said Parker. "Well, we'll leave him out. And of course we're <==
watching that bike at Euston to see if anybody's fool enough to come for
it. And you'd better send somebody down to identify it, because it may
not be the right one at all. Is that all? Suppose now we go and have a
drink after all this talking? Oh, by the way, can you tell me what

school Gowan went to? No? Oh, well, it doesn't matter. He's probably in
the reference-books."

The Inspector still seemed a little unhappy.

==> "What is it?" said Parker. <==

"Ye havena----" he began. And then added, impulsively, "if we canna find
somethin' sune, I'm thinkin' ye'll be hearin' officially fra' the Chief
Constable."

time, and you seem to me to be doing very well. We have to give you help
at this end, of course--just as you would help me if one of my pet-lambs
escaped to Scotland--but surely there's no call for us to take over the
management of the case. It seems to be a matter in which the local man
has all the advantages on his side."

And if Jock Graham had guilty knowledge, then what became of the
beautiful theory about Farren, and the hopeful imbroglio about the
bicycle?

The Sergeant groaned aloud. He might have groaned still more deeply if
==> he had known that Inspector Macpherson and Chief Inspector Parker of <==
Scotland Yard were at that very moment engaged in destroying the
beautiful Farren theory in favour of a Gowan theory.

His eye fell upon an object lying on his desk. It was a grey felt
hat--the sole treasure-trove that the search-party had so far brought

Then, getting up and buckling the belt of his leather coat, he observed,
pleasantly:

"If any friends of mine should come inquiring for Mr. Ford, be sure you

"Mester Parker?" said the landlady, mystified, but impressed. "Well, to

Wimsey paid his bill and went out. As he drove away he saw her standing,
book in hand, under the signboard, staring at the bull which capered so
bravely on the bright green grass.

"What!"

"He says he was the body--Gowan was."

"Och, tae hell wi' 't!" exclaimed the Inspector, oblivious of etiquette.
==> Parker chuckled again. <==

"He says Campbell knocked him out and left him there." "Does he so, sir?
Weel, I'm thinkin' it'll be best I should come an' see him. Can ye keep
him till I come?"

But Lord Peter Wimsey refused the invitation. "I'd adore to come," he
said, "but I feel it would be mere self-indulgence. I fancy I know what
story he's going to tell." He grinned. "I shall be missing something.
But I can really be more useful--if I'm useful at all, that is--this

"Ye've solved the problem?"

"Yes. The mystery is a mystery no longer."

Macpherson, wheeling suddenly round upon him, fell back with a startled
snort.

"Him? Yon's no the man."

"It's no Gowan," said Macpherson, "nor onything like him. I never saw
yon ferrety-faced fellow in my life."

This was more than the gentleman in question could put up with.

suggestion of seediness and neglect.

"It's Gowan's voice, right eneugh," admitted the Inspector.

removal of the beard and moustache a little misleading. Put on your hat,
Mr. Gowan, and wrap your scarf about your chin. Then, perhaps----"

The Inspector gazed with a kind of horror, as this metamorphosis was
accomplished.

than going about in Kirkcudbright and being commiserated."

Gowan wriggled on his chair.

==> "Quite so, quite so," said Parker, soothingly. He passed the back of his <==
thumb carelessly down his own profile as he spoke. It was irregular, but
the chin was reassuringly prominent. He was clean-shaven and could, he
felt, stand it reasonably well.

"Next day," said Gowan, "we heard the news about Campbell's death.
