First Class and Mary's in the Second. And since then, Mary had married
and scarcely been heard of; except that she haunted the College with a
sick persistence, never missing an Old Students' Meeting or a Gaudy. But
Harriet had broken all her old ties and half the commandments, dragged
her reputation in the dust and made money, had the rich and amusing Lord
==> Peter Wimsey at her feet, to marry him if she chose, and was full of <==
energy and bitterness and the uncertain rewards of fame. Prometheus and
Epimetheus had changed their parts, it seemed; but for one there was the
box of troubles and for the other the bare rock and the vulture; and
never, it seemed to Harriet, could they meet on any common ground again.

with the sterilisation of the unfit, and the encouragement of matrimony
among the intelligentsia.

Harriet, meanwhile, sat miserably wondering what devil possessed her to
display every disagreeable trait in her character at the mere mention of
==> Wimsey's name. He had done her no harm; he had only saved her from a <==
shameful death and offered her an unswerving personal devotion; and for
neither benefit had he ever claimed or expected her gratitude. It was
not pretty that her only return should be a snarl of resentment. The
fact is, thought Harriet, I have got a bad inferiority complex;
unfortunately, the fact that I know it doesn't help me to get rid of it.

'In law,' said Harriet, 'it is every citizen's obligation--though most
people don't know that.'

==> 'And this man Wimsey,' said Miss Barton, 'who seems to make a hobby of <==
it--does he look upon it as a duty or as an intellectual exercise?'

'I'm not sure,' said Harriet, 'but, you know, it was just as well for me
that he did make a hobby of it. The police were wrong in my case--I
don't blame them, but they were--so I'm glad it wasn't left to them.'

old pupil cut short her interview with Miss Lydgate, and she went out,
vaguely envious, to encounter the persistent Miss Mollison, primed with
every remorseless detail of the clock incident. It gave her pleasure to
inform Miss Mollison that Mr. A. E. W. Mason had hit on the same idea
earlier. Unquenchable, Miss Mollison proceeded to question her victim
==> eagerly about Lord Peter Wimsey, his manners, customs and appearance; <==
and when Miss Mollison was driven away by Miss Schuster-Slatt, the
irritation was little relieved, for Harriet was subjected to a long
harangue about the sterilisation of the unfit, to which (it appeared) a
campaign to encourage the marriage of the fit was a necessary corollary.
Harriet agreed that intellectual women should marry and reproduce their

good-humour. 'No. I'm just the little worker-bee, gathering honey for
the queens to eat.'

'How all occasions do inform against me!' muttered Harriet to herself.
One would have thought that Oxford at least would offer a respite from
==> Peter Wimsey and the marriage question. But although she herself was a <==
notoriety, if not precisely a celebrity, it was an annoying fact that
Peter was a still more spectacular celebrity, and that, of the two,
people would rather know about him than about her. As regards
marriage--well, here one certainly had a chance to find out whether it
worked or not. Was it worse to be a Mary Attwood (_nÃ©e_ Stokes) or a

dead--still less because one had once liked them very much. Some happy
souls could go through life without making this discovery, and they were
the men and women who were called 'sincere.' Still, there remained old
friends whom one was glad to meet again, like the Dean and Phoebe
Tucker. And really, everybody had been quite extraordinarily decent.
==> Rather inquisitive and silly about 'the man Wimsey,' some of them, but <==
no doubt with the best intentions. Miss Hillyard might be an exception,
but there had always been something a little twisted and uncomfortable
about Miss Hillyard.

As the car wound its way over the Chilterns, Harriet grinned to herself,

his passing were gradually fading away. Clinging on, by blind instinct,
to the job that had to be done, she had fought her way back to an
insecure stability. Was it too late to achieve wholly the clear eye and
the untroubled mind? And what, in that case, was she to do with one
powerful fetter which still tied her ineluctably to the bitter past?
==> What about Peter Wimsey? <==

During the past three years, their relations had been peculiar.
Immediately after the horrible business that they had investigated
together at Wilvercombe, Harriet--feeling that something must be done to
ease a situation which was fast becoming intolerable--had carried out a

background presented itself for a story. Financially the trip had been a
success. She had gathered material for two full-length novels, the
scenes laid respectively in Madrid and Carcassonne, and written a series
of short stories dealing with detective adventures in Hitlerite Berlin,
and also a number of travel articles; thus more than replenishing the
==> treasury. Before her departure, she had asked Wimsey not to write. He <==
had taken the prohibition with unexpected meekness.

'I see. Very well. _Vade in pacem._ If you ever want me, you will find
the Old Firm at the usual stand.'

crowded. That meant that if you went there you were seen. If one
intended to break off a connection with anyone, it was perhaps not the
best opening move to _afficher_ one's self with him at Ferrara's.

Oddly enough, this would be the first time she had dined in the West End
==> with Peter Wimsey. During the first year or so after her trial, she had <==
not wanted to appear anywhere, even had she then been able to afford the
frocks to appear in. In those days, he had taken her to the quieter and
better restaurants in Soho, or, more often, carried her off, sulky and
rebellious, in the car to such roadside inns as kept reliable cooks. She
had been too listless to refuse these outings, which had probably done

'I have the most ill-regulated memory. It does those things which it
ought not to do and leaves undone the things it ought to have done, but
it has not yet gone on strike altogether.'

==> The taxi drew up, and the driver peered round inquiringly. Wimsey handed <==
her out and waited gravely while she disentangled her latch-key. Then he
took it from her, opened the door for her, said good night and was gone.

Mounting the stone staircase, she knew that, as far as this situation
was concerned, her flight had been useless. She was back in the old net

Looking back upon her visit to Oxford, Harriet found that it had had an
==> unsettling effect. She had begun to take Wimsey for granted, as one <==
might take dynamite for granted in a munitions factory. But the
discovery that the mere sound of his name still had the power to provoke
such explosions in herself--that she could so passionately resent, at
one and the same time, either praise or blame of him on other people's
lips--awakened a misgiving that dynamite was perhaps still dynamite,

==> So that when Wimsey eventually got back from his expedition north, she <==
went to meet him in a belligerent spirit. He had asked her to dine with
him, this time, at the Egotists' Club--an unusual venue. It was a
Saturday night, and they had the room to themselves. She mentioned her
Oxford visit and took the opportunity to recite to him a list of
promising scholars, distinguished in their studies and subsequently

seems to be catching me in several of the same places.'

He got up cautiously. The waiter arrived and restored Harriet's bag,
together with some letters which she had taken from the postman as she
left the house and thrust into the outer pocket of the bag without
==> reading. Wimsey steered his guest into the lounge, established her in a <==
chair and lowered himself with a grimace into one corner of a low couch.

'Rather a long way down, isn't it?'

'It's all right when you get there. Sorry to be always presenting myself

Two old brandies, James.'

'Very good, my lord. This was found under the table in the dining-room,
madam.'

==> 'More of your scattered belongings?' said Wimsey, as she took the <==
post-card; then, seeing her flush and frown of disgust. 'What is it?'

'Nothing,' said Harriet, pushing the ugly scrawl into her bag.

He looked at her.

Later in the evening, having lent a strong arm to extricate him,
swearing loudly, from the difficult depths of the couch, and dispatched
him to such rest as he might reasonably look for between the pains of
love and sticking-plaster, she had leisure to reflect that if fate had
==> vanquished either of them it was not Peter Wimsey. He knew too well the <==
wrestler's trick of letting the adversary's own strength defeat itself.
Yet she knew with certainty that if, when he had said, 'Shall I go?' she
had replied with firm kindness, 'I'm sorry, but I think it would be
better,' there would have been the desired end of the matter.

seemlier English than 'undergraduette,' and that the correct method of
describing Dr. Baring was 'the Warden.' The only result of this was to
provoke a correspondence headed 'Lady Undergrads,' and a reference to
'sweet girl-graduates.'

==> She informed Wimsey--who happened to be the nearest male person handy <==
for scarifying--that this kind of vulgarity was typical of the average
man's attitude to women's intellectual interests. He replied that bad
manners always made him sick; but was it any worse than headlining
foreign monarchs by their Christian names, untitled?

She woke next morning with a change of heart. She had said that personal
feeling ought not to stand in the way of public utility. And it should
==> not. If Wimsey could be made useful to Shrewsbury College, she would use <==
him. Whether she liked it or not, whether or not she had to put up with
his saying 'I told you so,' she would put her pride in her pocket and
ask him the best way to go about the job. She had her bath and dressed,
glowing all the time with a consciousness of her own disinterested
devotion to the cause of truth. She came into the sitting-room and

person and the greatest possible discretion.'

For she had remembered that there was a Miss Katherine Climpson, who ran
what was ostensibly a Typing Bureau but was in fact a useful
organisation of women engaged in handling odd little investigations. The
==> Bureau was self-supporting, though it had, she knew, Peter Wimsey's <==
money behind it. She was one of the very few people in the Kingdom who
did know that.

The Treasurer coughed.

as the suspected party she naturally made no allusion; nor in the
ensuing discussion was anybody so tactless as to mention it. The
Wilvercombe murder was a different matter. There was no obvious reason
why she should not tell the students about that, and it seemed unkind to
deprive them of a legitimate thrill on the purely personal grounds that
==> it was a bore to have to mention Peter Wimsey in every second sentence. <==
Her exposition, though perhaps erring slightly on the dry and academic
side, was received with hearty applause, and at the end of the meeting
the Senior Student, one Miss Millbanks, invited her to coffee.

Miss Millbanks had her room in Queen Elizabeth, and had furnished it

good-night. On her way over to Tudor, Harriet cut down the dangling
dummy and carried it away with her for scrutiny and action at a later
hour. She felt she badly needed to sleep on the situation.

She must have been weary, for she dropped off as soon as she was in bed,

gathering the 'oojahs' deftly up into their native bag.

'You haven't called me any names yet,' said the young man.

'I believe I could almost put a name to you,' said Harriet. 'Isn't

'Why, of course,' said the young man, sitting up on his heels. 'He's my
uncle; and a dashed sight more accommodating than the Jewish kind,' he
added, as though struck by a melancholy association of ideas. 'Have I
met you somewhere? Or was it pure guesswork? You don't think I'm like

Nobody killed, fortunately. Saint-George took a telegraph pole in his

merely enjoyed it, or what he had to do with it, but that's what I was

and, what is more, into yours, where I have no right to be; in fact, I

lift a hand to prevent it.

In fact, for the first time in their acquaintance, she had the upper
==> hand of Peter Wimsey, and could rub his aristocratic nose in the dirt if <==
she wanted to. Since she had been looking for such an opportunity for
five years, it would be odd if she did not hasten to take advantage of
it.

Slowly and with extreme pains, she started on Draft No. 5.

away in his pocket-book. 'The sun is shining, and I am in the mood to
make mistakes through over-confidence.'

'Then, I must take advantage of the good moment.' The Count set his
elbows on the table and leaned forward, thumb-tip to thumb-tip and

'It must be splendid to be able to write,' said Mr. Arbuthnot. 'I often
think I could spin a good yarn myself if I had the brains. About the odd
things that happen, you know. Queer deals, and that kind of thing.'

==> A dim recollection of something Wimsey had once said lit up the <==
labyrinth of Harriet's mind. Money. That was the connection between the
two men. Mr. Arbuthnot, moron as he might be in other respects, had a
flair for money. He knew what that mysterious commodity was going to do;
it was the one thing he did know, and he only knew that by instinct.

likely to be restricted to University people and their friends. She
might be an undergraduate, come up with a County Scholarship. In any
case, one was perhaps attaching too much importance to the incident.

They were passing the bell-chamber now, and the brazen clamour was loud
==> and insistent. It reminded her of a story that Peter Wimsey had told <==
her, years ago now, one day when only a resolute determination to talk
on and on had enabled him to prevent a most unfortunate outing from
ending in a quarrel. Something about a body in a belfry, and a flood,
and the great bells bawling the alarm across three counties.

had elated her. She ought to have been thoroughly ashamed of herself.
She ought to be blaming herself for not having seen what was happening
to Mr. Pomfret and taken steps to stop it. Why hadn't she? Simply, she
supposed, because the possibility of such a thing had never occurred to
her. She had taken it for granted that she could never again attract any
==> man's fancy, except the eccentric fancy of Peter Wimsey. And to him she <==
was, of course, only the creature of his making and the mirror of his
own magnanimity. Reggie Pomfret's devotion, though ridiculous, was at
least single-minded; _he_ was no King Cophetua; she had not to be humbly
obliged to _him_ for kindly taking notice of her. And that reflection,
after all, was pleasurable. However loudly we may assert our own

'The fact is,' said Harriet to the telephone, 'I don't know whether I
want a doctor or a detective. But I've got to have somebody.'

She wished--and not for the first time--that she could have got hold of
==> Peter Wimsey. Not, of course, that this was the kind of case he could <==
very suitably have investigated himself; but he would probably have
known the right person. He at least would be surprised at nothing,
shocked at nothing; he had far too wide an experience of the world. And
he was completely to be trusted. But he was not there. He had vanished
from view at the very moment when the Shrewsbury affair had first come

he was completely to be trusted. But he was not there. He had vanished
from view at the very moment when the Shrewsbury affair had first come
to her notice; it seemed almost pointed. Like Lord Saint-George, she
began to feel that Peter really had no right to disappear just when he
was wanted. The fact that she had spent five years angrily refusing to
==> contract further obligations towards Peter Wimsey had no weight with her <==
now; she would readily have contracted obligations towards the devil
himself, if she could have been sure that the prince of darkness was a
gentleman of Peter's kidney. But Peter was as far beyond reach as
Lucifer.

say. A brief sentence of apology; another brief sentence of explanation
and a request for advice; into whose hands should the case be put? There
was, surely, nothing difficult about that.

The voice from Rome spoke English very well. It did not think Lord Peter

could hear feet passing to and fro on the other side of the continent.
Then the voice again, suave and apologetic.

which Harriet recognised as that of the Master of Balliol. Beside him
was another M.A. who, as Harriet and the Dean went by, conversing of
counterpoint, turned suddenly and lifted his mortar-board.

For a long moment, Harriet simply could not believe her eyes. Peter

planted placidly in the High as though he had grown there from the
beginning. Peter, wearing cap and gown like any orthodox Master of Arts,
presenting every appearance of having piously attended the University
Sermon, and now talking mild academic shop with two Fellows of All Souls
and the Master of Balliol.

why didn't he let me know?'

She found herself confusedly receiving introductions and presenting Lord
Peter to the Dean.

And then more explanations--something about flying over from Warsaw, and
'my nephew at the House,' and 'the Master's kind hospitality,' and
sending a note round to College. Then, out of the jumble of polite
nothings, a sentence she grasped clearly.

It appeared that he was lunching with the Master, and that one of the

gathered, some kind of historical basis, mention of somebody's article

'step into All Souls and look at--it won't take you ten minutes,' and
references to the printing and distribution of Reformation polemical
pamphlets--to Wimsey's expert knowledge--to the other man's expert

from another university.

'step into All Souls and look at--it won't take you ten minutes,' and
references to the printing and distribution of Reformation polemical

knowledge--and to the inexpert pretence at knowledge of some historian
from another university.

Then the whole group broke up. The Master raised his cap and drifted
away, reminding Wimsey and the historian that lunch would be at 1.15;

Peter said something to Harriet about being 'round in twenty minutes,'

the Dean were walking together again.

'Well!' said the Dean, 'so that's the man.'

'I never thought of him as a historian.'

'Well, he took a First, anyway ... didn't you know?'

She had not known. She had not even troubled to wonder. She had never

Foreign Office business all over again. If he had realised her
thoughtlessness it must have hurt him. She saw herself as a monster of
callous ingratitude.

'No,' said Harriet.

So the Dean had been making inquiries. Naturally, she would. Probably
the whole S.C.R. could by now give her detailed information about

along those lines. But she herself might surely have found the energy
for two minutes' study of the Calendar.

'Yes,' said he bitterly, 'and it goes on: "But they said: we will not
walk therein." Rest? I had forgotten there was such a word.'

'So had I.'

and struck a match for them both.

some day some perfectly irresistible peach of a problem will blossom out
at Brighton or Blackpool, and that I shall be weak-minded enough to go

'Confound it, Harriet! My one really shameful weakness. My most

and remorsely exposed. I am idiotically proud of having inherited the

for a moment. 'I wonder all the strength hasn't been bred out of them by

She was punctual at the bridge, but found Peter there before her. His
obsolete politeness in this respect was emphasised by the presence of
Miss Flaxman and another Shrewsburian, who were sitting on the raft,
apparently waiting for their escort, and looking rather hot and

hand her ceremoniously into the punt and arrange the cushions for her,
and to know, by his ironical eyes, that he perfectly well understood the
reason of her unusual meekness.

they were checked by another punt, which was clumsily revolving in
mid-stream and cramming a couple of canoes rather dangerously against

stringy young man, naked to the waist and shrimp-pink with the sun) 'you

Whereat a middle-aged man, whose punt was moored a little way farther
on, turned his head sharply and cried in ringing tones:

They had put in under the dappled shade of an overhanging willow a

just too sympathetic, and favoured each of them with an advance copy of

urbanity, while Harriet, wishing that the Isis would flood its banks and
drown them all, envied his self-command. When at length Miss

wafted back her shrill voice from afar:

The spine was untitled, and as she turned back the worn calf cover the

He took a lens from his pocket and ran it, rather perfunctorily, over

conjectures like cold water on hot glass, and shatters them to bits. But
I don't believe it. She had only to feel her way along the wall. She
must have had some reason for going back into the middle of the room.'

It was the Dean who picked up a second hairpin--in the place where one

'That,' said his lordship, 'is very true indeed.'

glancing round, had to admit that there were more of them there that

'Comedian!' thought Harriet, as Miss Barton, finding she could make

(Heavens! thought Harriet, I hope he knows his stuff.)

'And Miss de Vine is making a complete conquest of him.'

'It's mutual, I fancy. At any rate, her back hair's coming down, which
is a sure sign of pleasure and excitement.'

==> 'Yes,' said Harriet. Wimsey was arguing, with intelligence about the <==
appropriation of monastic funds, but she had little doubt that the back
of his mind was full of hairpins.

'Here comes the Warden. We shall have to separate them forcibly. He's

'All right; I'll go and prattle to him. You'd better sit opposite to us
and kick me if I say anything indiscreet.'

By this arrangement, Harriet found herself placed a little uncomfortably
between Miss Hillyard (in whom she always felt an antagonism to herself)

detective hobbies), and face to face with the two people whose glances
were most likely to disturb her gravity. On the other side of the Dean

'There is a question on which I am anxious to be instructed,' said Miss
Pyke, 'if you will not take it amiss.'

Miss Pyke, of course, was still worried about Dr. Threep's shirt-front,
==> and determined on getting enlightenment. Harriet hoped that Wimsey would <==
recognise her curiosity for what it was: not skittishness, but the
embarrassing appetite for exact information which characterises the
scholarly mind.

'That phenomenon,' he said, readily, 'comes within my own sphere of

'Thank you so much,' said Miss Pyke. 'That is a most satisfactory
explanation. At this time of day, it is perhaps not improper to adduce
the parallel instance of the old-fashioned corset, which was subject to
a similar inconvenience.'

plate armour, which had to be very well tailored to allow of movement at
all.'

At this point, Miss Barton captured Harriet's attention with some remark
or other, and she lost track of the conversation on the other side of

'Will he lay traps all evening for us to walk into?'

Harriet realised for a moment how queer the whole situation was. Once

the women who, with so strange a generosity, were welcoming the
inquisitor among them. She said, however:

'If he does, he will display all the mechanism in the most obliging

She detached herself from the other two, and went on into the Senior
Common Room with a sombre face.

==> 'Curious,' said Harriet. 'She is saying about Peter Wimsey exactly what <==
I have always thought about herself.'

'Perhaps she recognises a kindred spirit.'

'Or a foe worthy of--I ought not to say that.'

'Perhaps she recognises a kindred spirit.'

Here Peter and his companion caught them up, and the Dean, joining Miss

interrogative smile.

'What's worrying you.'

'Peter--I feel exactly like Judas.'

'They're trying it in Germany, I believe,' said Miss Edwards.

'Together,' said Miss Hillyard, 'with the relegation of woman to her
proper place in the home.'

==> 'But they execute people there quite a lot,' said Wimsey, 'so Miss <==
Barton can't take over their organisation lock, stock and barrel.'

Miss Barton uttered a loud protest against any such suggestion, and
returned to her contention that _her_ social principles were opposed to
violence of every description.

'On that ground, Lord Peter,' said the Warden, 'your inquisitiveness
becomes a principle. And a very dangerous one.'

'Professional etiquette,' said Harriet, 'would suggest an extorted
confession, followed by poison for two in the library.'

'Miss Vane feels no compunction. She wipes me out with a firm hand,
rather than damage my reputation. But the question isn't always so
simple. How about the artist of genius who has to choose between letting
his family starve and painting pot-boilers to keep them?'

'I've no objection to scientific pot-boilers,' said Miss Edwards. 'I
mean, a popular book isn't necessarily unscientific.'

be a different kind of thing. To take a concrete instance--somebody
wrote a novel called _The Search_--'

him. He tells him: "The only ethical principle which has made science
possible is that the truth shall be told all the time. If we do not
penalise false statements made in error, we open up the way for false
statements by intention. And a false statement of fact, made
deliberately, is the most serious crime a scientist can commit." Words

nothing to gain by not telling the truth.'

'The truth is,' said Mrs. Goodwin, 'that nobody could possibly defend
the indefensible.'

have taken a strong fancy to Peter's conversation), Miss Chilperic,
silent and half-hidden in an obscure position and, rather to Harriet's
surprise, Miss Hillyard.

==> The clocks struck eleven. Wimsey roused himself and said he thought he <==
had better be getting along. Everybody rose. The Old Quad was dark,
except for the gleam of lighted windows; the sky had clouded, and a
rising wind stirred the boughs of the beech trees.

'Well, good night,' said Miss Edwards. 'I'll see that you get a copy of

Miss Edwards strode briskly away.

'Good night, Lord Peter.'

There were a number of students scurrying about the corridors in
undress, who looked at Peter with more curiosity than annoyance. In
Harriet's room, they found her gown lying on the table, together with
the dossier. Peter picked up the book, examined the paper and string and
the seals which secured them, each one stamped with the crouching cat

'If that's been opened, I'll make a meal of hot sealing-wax.'

He went to the window and looked out into the quad.

stairs, Harriet fancied she heard somebody stir in the darkness and saw
the faint glimmer of a watching face; but it was gone before she could
draw Peter's attention to it.

the threshold, tossed him a heedless good night.

'Good night, Major Wimsey, sir!'

'Hullo!' Peter brought back the foot that was already in St. Cross Road,

reminded of his manners, apologised to Harriet and plunged hastily out,

'Oho!' said the Dean. 'So _that's_ how the milk got into the coconut!'

From the door of the Library Wing there issued slowly Miss de Vine, and

tennis court in earnest conversation. Lord Saint-George, viewing them
from afar, advanced to meet them. They joined forces on the path. They
stood for a little time talking. They moved away towards the Lodge.

'Dear me!' said the Dean. 'Abduction of Helen de Vine by Paris and

She went out, and slammed the door. Lord Saint-George had wandered back
and was sitting in the loggia leading up to the Library. He rose
politely as Miss Barton stalked past him on the way to her room, and
made some remark, to which the Fellow replied briefly, but with a smile.

==> 'Insinuating men, these Wimseys,' said the Dean. 'Vamping the S.C.R. <==
right and left.'

Harriet laughed, but in Saint-George's quick, appraising glance at Miss
Barton she had again seen his uncle look for a moment out of his eyes.
These family resemblances were unnerving. She curled herself into the

'I brought him here,' said Peter, 'to see if he could make any
identifications. But he doesn't seem able to.'

Lord Saint-George greeted Harriet enthusiastically.

She ran up to her room to get the papers, and from the window observed
that the Wimsey family was having the matter out with itself. When she

suffered less than the others physically, seemed to be still haunted by
nervous terrors, and crept unhappily about her duties with the other
Common-Room maid always closely in attendance.

in order to lay certain information before the staff. Harriet had
received from him a brief and characteristic note, which said:

There had been an evening when he had turned up to keep a
previously-made dinner appointment, but had obviously been unfit either
to eat or talk. Eventually he had confessed to a splitting headache and
a temperature and suffered himself to be personally conducted home. She
had been sufficiently alarmed not to leave him till he was safely in his
==> own flat and in the capable hands of Bunter. The latter had been <==
reassuring: the trouble was nothing but reaction--of frequent occurrence
at the end of a trying case, but soon over. A day or two later, the
patient had rung up, apologised, and made a fresh appointment, at which
he had displayed a quite remarkable effervescence of spirits.

'That might easily happen,' said Harriet, thinking of the plug-ugly.

'Well, that makes it all the worse for him,' said Lord Saint-George,
shaking his head. 'The more risks he takes, the quicker he's got to toe
the line for the matrimonial stakes. No more bachelor freedom with old
==> Bunter in a Piccadilly flat. _And_ no more spectacular Viennese singers. <==
So you see, it's as much as his life's worth to let anything happen to
me.'

'Obviously,' said Harriet, fascinated by this new light on the subject.

    I am writing to thank Miss Vane for her kindness to you. She is

    feelings as a man and an uncle.

==>     Bunter has just found three silver threads among the gold. He is <==
    incredibly shocked. He begs to tender you his respectful
    commiserations, and advises scalp-massage (for me, I mean).

'You only look as though you hadn't slept for weeks.'

'I'm not sure that I have, now you mention it. I thought--at one point
we all thought--something might be going to happen. All the old filthy
==> uproar. I got as far as saying to Bunter one night: "It's coming; it's <==
here; back to the Army again, sergeant...." But in the end, you know, it
made a noise like a hoop and rolled away--for the moment.'

'Thanks to the comic cross-talk?'

==> He came accompanied by Bunter and a camera. Harriet took them into the <==
Dean's room and told them the story, with some assistance from Miss
Martin, who asked whether he would like to interview the two scouts.

'Not for the moment. You seem to have asked all the necessary questions.
We'll go and look at the room. There's no way to it, I take it, except

right. May I have the key?'

He threw the door open and glanced in.

==> 'Get a photograph of this, Bunter. You have very nice, well-fitting <==
doors in this building. Oak. No paint, no polish.'

He took a lens from his pocket and ran it, rather perfunctorily, over
the light-switch and the door-handle.

'Am I really going to see finger-prints discovered?' asked the Dean.

'Why, of course,' said Wimsey. 'It won't tell us anything, but it
==> impresses the spectator and inspires confidence. Bunter, the <==
insufflator. You will now see,' he pumped the white powder rapidly over
the frame and handle of the door, 'how inveterate is the habit of
catching hold of doors when you open them.' An astonishing number of
superimposed prints sprang into view above the lock as he blew the
superfluous powder away. 'Hence the excellent old-fashioned institution

'Yes; but that proves she really did get out this way and at that time.
Though it scarcely needed proving. There _is_ no other way out. This
isn't the old problem of a hermetically sealed chamber and a body. Have

'Yes, my lord; I have made three exposures.'

'That ought to do. You might clean those doors, would you.' He turned,
smiling, on the Dean. 'You see, even if we did identify all those

invite discovery?'

'Excuse me, my lord.'

'Would this be any contribution to the inquiry?'

Bunter dived beneath the table and came up, holding a long black
hairpin.

'Oh, quite a number, nowadays,' said the Dean. 'Little buns in the neck

the students. And Miss Lydgate--but I think hers are bronze, too.'

'Great Heavens!' said Harriet. 'Did you sit up all night with the
dossier?'

start being solicitous. Men have died and the worms have eaten them, but
not for early rising. In fact, it is said that it's the early worm that

'I should be wasted on her. Besides, she would always be deceiving me,

object to being tactfully managed by somebody who ought to be my equal.
If I want tactful dependents, I can hire them. And fire them if they get

'I shall have to make quite an issue of dog-collars,' said Peter. 'You
never know whether to warn people or not. Some of them get hysterics,
but she looks fairly level-headed. Look here, my dear, this is all very
tiresome. If it's another summons to Rome, I shall have to go. (I should
lock that door.) Needs must when duty calls, and all that. If it _is_
==> Rome, I'll tell Bunter to bring round all the notes I've got at the <==
Mitre and instruct Miss Climpson's sleuths to report direct to you. In
any case, I'll ring you up this evening as soon as I know what it's all
about. If it isn't Rome, I'll come round again in the morning. And in
the meantime, don't let anybody into your room. I think I'd lock it up
and sleep elsewhere to-night.'

tables and chairs were set out upon the grass beneath the shade of the

showed its bare rafters in a forest of scaffolding. A few groups of

lemon frock with muslin frills, which looked incongruous beneath a gown.

Vera Mollison. She was asking: 'Are you writing anything now?'

==> 'Yes, certainly,' said Harriet. 'Are you still teaching?' <==

'Yes--still in the same place,' said Miss Mollison. 'I'm afraid my
doings are very small beer compared with yours.'

As there was no possible answer to this but a deprecating laugh, Harriet

'Yes--still in the same place,' said Miss Mollison. 'I'm afraid my

laughed deprecatingly. A movement took place. People were drifting into
the New Quad, where a Presentation Clock was to be unveiled, and taking
up their positions upon the stone plinth that ran round behind the
flower-beds. An official voice was heard exhorting the guests to leave a
path for the procession. Harriet used this excuse to disentangle herself

from Vera Mollison and establish herself at the back of a group, all of
whose faces were strange to her. On the opposite side of the Quad she
could see Mary Attwood and her friends. They were waving. She waved
back. She was _not_ going to cross the grass and join them. She would
remain detached, a unit in an official crowd.

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 104671    window = 104666 104676


the golden hand of the clock moved on, and the quarter-chime rang out
mellowly. The assembly heaved a sigh of satisfaction; the procession
collected itself and made the return journey through the archway, and
the ceremony was happily over.

==> Harriet, following with the throng, discovered to her horror that Vera <==
Mollison had bobbed up again beside her, and was saying she supposed all
mystery-writers must feel a strong personal interest in clocks, as so
many alibis turned upon clocks and time-signals. There had been a
curious incident one day at the school where she taught; it would, she
thought, make a splendid plot for a detective-story, for anybody who was

curious incident one day at the school where she taught; it would, she
thought, make a splendid plot for a detective-story, for anybody who was
clever enough to work such things out. She had been longing to see
==> Harriet and tell her all about it. Planting herself firmly on the lawn <==
of the Old Quad, at a considerable distance from the refreshment-tables,
she began to retail the curious incident, which required a good deal of
preliminary explanation. A scout advanced, carrying cups of tea. Harriet
secured one, and instantly wished she hadn't; it prevented swift
movement, and seemed to nail her to Miss Mollison's side to all

eternity. Then, with a heart-lifting surge of thankfulness, she saw
PhÅbe Tucker. Good old PhÅbe, looking exactly the same as ever. She
excused herself hurriedly to Miss Mollison, begging that she might hear

[line number in individual story] matching line = 477    window = 472 482

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 104721    window = 104716 104726


don't you think?'

'Infinitely.'

Here at any rate was somebody who had not altered by a hair's-breadth,
==> in spite of added years and marriage. Harriet was in a mood to be glad <==
of that. After an exhaustive inquiry into the matter of funerary rites,
she asked after the family.

'Oh, they're getting to be rather fun. Richard--that's the eldest--is
thrilled by the burial-places. His grandmother was horrified the other

[line number in individual story] matching line = 498    window = 493 503

them, like characters in books, it would be much more satisfactory to a
well-regulated mind.'

From this the conversation naturally passed to biology, Mendelian
factors and _Brave New World_. It was cut short by the emergence of
==> Harriet's former tutor from a crowd of old students. Harriet and PhÅbe <==
made a concerted rush to greet her. Miss Lydgate's manner was exactly
what it had always been. To the innocent and candid eyes of that great
scholar, no moral problem seemed ever to present itself. Of a scrupulous
personal integrity, she embraced the irregularities of other people in a
wide, unquestioning charity. As any student of literature must, she knew

[line number in individual story] matching line = 514    window = 509 519

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 104758    window = 104753 104763


that they could be deliberately wicked, like Richard III or Iago.
Unhappy, yes; misguided, yes; exposed to difficult and complicated
temptations which Miss Lydgate herself had been mercifully spared, yes.
If she heard of a theft, a divorce, even worse things, she would knit
puzzled brows and think how utterly wretched the offenders must have
==> been before they could do so dreadful a thing. Only once had Harriet <==
ever heard her speak with unqualified disapproval of any one she knew,
and that was of a former pupil of her own who had written a popular book
about Carlyle, 'No research at all,' had been Miss Lydgate's verdict,
'and no effort at critical judgment. She has reproduced all the old
gossip without troubling to verify anything. Slipshod, showy, and

[line number in individual story] matching line = 560    window = 555 565

back to England. Of course, having to give up Flamborough made a good
deal of difference from the financial point of view; so it's nice to
think that for the next three years she'll be able to get on with her
book and not worry about that side of things.'

==> 'I remember about it now,' said Harriet; 'I saw the election announced <==
somewhere or other, last Christmas or thereabouts.'

'I expect you saw it in the Shrewsbury Year-Book. We are naturally very
proud to have her here. She ought really to have a professorship, but I
doubt if she could stand the tutorial side of it. The fewer distractions

[line number in individual story] matching line = 584    window = 579 589

believe she's researching on the Bacon family. She's such a hard worker.
But I'm afraid she's putting poor Miss de Vine through a
cross-examination, which doesn't seem quite fair on an occasion like
this. Shall we go to the rescue?'

==> As Harriet followed Miss Lydgate across the lawn, she was visited by an <==
enormous nostalgia. If only one could come back to this quiet place,
where only intellectual achievement counted; if one could work here
steadily and obscurely at some close-knit piece of reasoning,
undistracted and uncorrupted by agents, contracts, publishers,
blurb-writers, interviewers, fan-mail, autograph-hunters,

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 104856    window = 104851 104861


herself.

Pulling her wandering thoughts together, she found herself being
introduced to Miss de Vine. And, looking at her, she saw at once that
here was a scholar of a kind very unlike Miss Lydgate, for example, and
==> still more grotesquely unlike anything that Harriet Vane could ever <==
become. Here was a fighter, indeed; but one to whom the quadrangle of
Shrewsbury was a native and proper arena; a soldier knowing no personal
loyalties, whose sole allegiance was to the fact. A Miss Lydgate,
standing serenely untouched by the world, could enfold it in a genial
warmth of charity; this woman, with infinitely more knowledge of the

[line number in individual story] matching line = 622    window = 617 627

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 104866    window = 104861 104871


warmth of charity; this woman, with infinitely more knowledge of the
world, would rate it at a just value and set it out of her path if it
incommoded her. The thin, eager face, with its large grey eyes deeply
set and luminous behind thick glasses, was sensitive to impressions; but
behind that sensitiveness was a mind as hard and immovable as granite.
==> As the Head of a woman's college she must, thought Harriet, have had a <==
distasteful task; for she looked as though the word 'compromise' had
been omitted from her vocabulary; and all statesmanship is compromise.
She would not be likely to tolerate any waverings of purpose or
woolliness of judgment. If anything came between her and the service of
truth, she would walk over it without rancour and without pity--even if

[line number in individual story] matching line = 641    window = 636 646

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 104885    window = 104880 104890


relations of things are just as much facts as the things themselves; and
if you get those wrong, you falsify the picture really seriously.'

Here, just as Miss Gubbins, with a mulish look in her eye, was preparing
to expostulate, Miss de Vine caught sight of the English tutor and
==> excused herself. Miss Gubbins was obliged to withdraw; Harriet observed <==
with regret that she had untidy hair, an ill-kept skin and a large white
safety-pin securing her hood to her dress.

'Dear me!' said Miss de Vine, 'who is that very uninspired young woman?
She seems very much annoyed with my review of Mr. Winterlake's book on

[line number in individual story] matching line = 667    window = 662 672

has got hold of a fact of genuine importance.'

'Well,' said Miss Lydgate, showing her strong teeth in a genial grin,
'you seem to have taken a strong line with Miss Gubbins. Now I've
brought along somebody I know you're anxious to meet. This is Miss
==> Harriet Vane--also an artist in the relating of details.' <==

'Miss Vane?' The historian bent her brilliant, short-sighted eyes on
Harriet, and her face lit up. 'This is delightful. Do let me say how
much I enjoyed your last book. I thought it quite the best thing you'd
done--though of course I'm not competent to form an opinion from the

who is quite a devotee of yours, and he said it suggested a most
interesting possibility, which had not before occurred to him. He wasn't
quite sure whether it would work, but he would do his best to find out.
Tell me, what did you have to go upon?'

==> 'Well, I got a pretty good opinion,' said Harriet, feeling a hideous <==
qualm of uncertainty, and cursing Professor Higgins from the bottom of
her heart. 'But of course--'

At this point Miss Lydgate espied another old pupil in the distance and
ran away. PhÅbe Tucker had already been lost on the way across the lawn.

==> Harriet was left to her fate. After ten minutes, during which Miss de <==
Vine ruthlessly turned her victim's brain inside out, shook the facts
out of it like a vigorous housemaid shaking dust from a carpet, beat it,
refreshed it, rubbed up the surface of it, relaid it in a new position
and tacked it into place with a firm hand, the Dean mercifully came up
and burst into the conversation.

about looking all bits and pieces, like illustrations to _Pendennis_--so
out of date of them! But their idea of being modern is to imitate what
male undergraduates were like half a century ago.'

==> 'Some of us old students aren't much to write home about,' said Harriet. <==
'Look at Gubbins, for instance.'

'Oh, my dear! That crashing bore. And _all_ held together with
safety-pins. And I wish she'd wash her neck.'

'I think,' said Miss de Vine, with painstaking readiness to set the
facts in a just light, 'that the colour is natural to her skin.'

'Then she should eat carrots and clear her system,' retorted the Dean,
==> snatching Harriet's gown from her. 'No, don't you bother. It won't take <==
me a minute to chuck them through the S.C.R. window. And don't you dare
to run away, or I shall _never_ find you again.'

'Is my hair tidy?' inquired Miss de Vine, becoming suddenly human and
hesitating with the loss of her cap and gown.

'Is my hair tidy?' inquired Miss de Vine, becoming suddenly human and
hesitating with the loss of her cap and gown.

==> 'Well,' said Harriet, surveying the thick, iron-grey coils from which a <==
quantity of overworked hairpins stood out like croquet-hoops, 'it's
coming down just a trifle.'

'It always does,' said Miss de Vine, making vague dabs at the pins. 'I
think I shall have to cut it short. It must be much less trouble that

==> So far, so good, thought Harriet, changing for dinner. There had been <==
baddish moments, like trying to renew contact with Mary Stokes. There
had also been a brief encounter with Miss Hillyard, the History tutor,
who had never liked her, and who had said, with wry mouth and acidulated
tongue, 'Well, Miss Vane, you have had some very _varied_ experiences
since we saw you last.' But there had been good moments too, carrying

her immune. But now it shattered her unaccustomed nerves with all and
more than all its original violence. People screamed in her ear, and she
found herself screaming back. She looked rather anxiously at Mary; could
any invalid bear it? Mary seemed not to notice; she was more animated
than she had been earlier in the day and was screaming quite cheerfully
==> at Dorothy Collins. Harriet turned to PhÅbe. <==

'Gosh! I'd forgotten what this row was like. If I scream I shall be as
hoarse as a crow. I'm going to bellow at you in a fog-horn kind of
voice. Do you mind?'

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 105139    window = 105134 105144


Miss Mollison leaned still farther, compressing Dorothy Collins, Betty
Armstrong and Mary Stokes almost to suffocation.

'I hope Miss Vane isn't telling you anything _too_ blood-curdling!'

==> 'No,' said Harriet loudly. 'Mrs. Bancroft is curdling _my_ blood.' <==

'How?'

'Telling me the life-histories of our year.'

'Telling me the life-histories of our year.'

'Oh!' screamed Miss Mollison, disconcerted. The service of a dish of
lamb and green peas intervened and broke up the formation, and her

and reply seemed to have opened up an avenue for a dark, determined
woman with large spectacles and rigidly groomed hair, who sat opposite
to her, and who now bent over and said, in piercingly American accents:

'I don't suppose you remember me, Miss Vane? I was only in college for

one term, but I would know you anywhere. I'm always recommending your
books to my friends in America who are keen to study the British
detective story, because I think they are just terribly good.'

==> 'Very kind of you,' said Harriet, feebly. <==

'And we have a very dear mutooal acquaintance,' went on the spectacled
lady.

Heavens! thought Harriet. What social nuisance is going to be dragged

out of obscurity now? And who is this frightful female?

'Really?' she said, aloud, trying to gain time while she ransacked her
memory. 'Who's that Miss--'

Supposed to read Law. Left after one term because the conditions at
Shrewsbury were too restrictive of liberty. Joined the Home Students,
and passed mercifully out of one's life.)

'How clever of you to know my name. Yes, well, you'll be surprised when

She spoke gravely, unrolling the great scroll of history, pleading for
the Humanities, proclaiming the Pax Academica to a world terrified with
unrest. 'Oxford has been called the home of lost causes: if the love of
learning for its own sake is a lost cause everywhere else in the world,
let us see to it that here, at least, it finds its abiding home.'
==> Magnificent thought Harriet, but it is not war. And then, her <==
imagination weaving in and out of the spoken words, she saw it as a Holy
War, and that whole wildly heterogeneous, that even slightly absurd
collection of chattering women fused into a corporate unity with one
another and with every man and woman to whom integrity of mind meant
more than material gain--defenders in the central keep of Man-soul,

no mean city. It might be an old and an old-fashioned city, with
inconvenient buildings and narrow streets where the passers-by squabbled
foolishly about the right of way; but her foundations were set upon the
holy hills and her spires touched heaven.

==> Leaving the Hall in this rather exalted mood, Harriet found herself <==
invited to take coffee with the Dean.

She accepted, after ascertaining that Mary Stokes was bound for bed by
doctor's orders and had therefore no claim upon her company. She
therefore made her way along to the New Quad and tapped upon Miss

extremely sound upon the life-history of the liver-fluke. Would anybody
like a Benedictine with the coffee? Come along, Miss Vane. Alcohol
loosens the tongue, and we want to hear all about your latest
mysteries.'

==> Harriet obliged with a brief rÃ©sumÃ© of the plot she was working on. <==

'Forgive me, Miss Vane, for speaking frankly,' said Miss Barton, leaning
earnestly forward, 'but after your own terrible experience, I wonder
that you care about writing that kind of book.'

earnestly forward, 'but after your own terrible experience, I wonder
that you care about writing that kind of book.'

The Dean looked a little shocked.

==> 'Well,' said Harriet, 'for one thing, writers can't pick and choose <==
until they've made money. If you've made your name for one kind of book
and then switch over to another, your sales are apt to go down, and
that's the brutal fact.' She paused. 'I know what you're thinking--that
anybody with proper sensitive feeling would rather scrub floors for a
living. But I should scrub floors very badly, and I write detective

'And, in the light of what you knew, did you like the idea of sending a
man to the dock and the gallows?'

'I don't think it's quite fair to ask Miss Vane that,' said the Dean.
==> 'Miss Barton,' she added, a little apologetically, to Harriet, 'is <==
interested in the sociological aspects of crime, and very eager for the
reform of the penal code.'

'I am,' said Miss Barton. 'Our attitude to the whole thing seems to me
completely savage and brutal. I have met so many murderers when visiting

'I am,' said Miss Barton. 'Our attitude to the whole thing seems to me
completely savage and brutal. I have met so many murderers when visiting
prisons; and most of them are very harmless, stupid people, poor
creatures, when they aren't definitely pathological.'

==> 'You might feel differently about it,' said Harriet, 'if you'd happened <==
to meet the victims. They are often still stupider and more harmless
than the murderers. But _they_ don't make a public appearance. Even the
jury needn't see the body unless they like. But I saw the body in that
Wilvercombe case--I _found_ it; and it was beastlier than anything you
can imagine.'

can imagine.'

'I'm quite sure you must be right about that,' said the Dean. 'The
description in the papers was more than enough for me.'

==> 'And,' went on Harriet to Miss Barton, 'you don't see the murderers <==
actively engaged in murdering. You see them when they're caught and
caged and looking pathetic. But the Wilvercombe man was a cunning,
avaricious brute, and quite ready to go on and do it again, if he hadn't
been stopped.'

'All the same,' said Miss Stevens, 'isn't it a little cold-blooded to
catch murderers as an intellectual exercise? It's all right for the
police--it's their duty.'

==> 'In law,' said Harriet, 'it is every citizen's obligation--though most <==
people don't know that.'

'And this man Wimsey,' said Miss Barton, 'who seems to make a hobby of
it--does he look upon it as a duty or as an intellectual exercise?'


[line number in individual story] matching line = 1156    window = 1151 1161

people don't know that.'

'And this man Wimsey,' said Miss Barton, 'who seems to make a hobby of
it--does he look upon it as a duty or as an intellectual exercise?'

==> 'I'm not sure,' said Harriet, 'but, you know, it was just as well for me <==
that he did make a hobby of it. The police were wrong in my case--I
don't blame them, but they were--so I'm glad it wasn't left to them.'

'I call that a perfectly noble speech,' said the Dean. 'If anyone had
accused me of doing something I hadn't done, I should be foaming at the

'I call that a perfectly noble speech,' said the Dean. 'If anyone had
accused me of doing something I hadn't done, I should be foaming at the
mouth.'

==> 'But it's my job to weigh evidence,' said Harriet, 'and I can't help <==
seeing the strength of the police case. It's a matter of a + b, you
know. Only there happened to be an unknown factor.'

'Like that thing that keeps cropping up in the new kind of physics,'
said the Dean. 'Planck's constant, or whatever they call it.'

said the Dean. 'Planck's constant, or whatever they call it.'

'Surely,' said Miss de Vine, 'whatever comes of it, and whatever anybody
feels about it, the important thing is to get at the facts.'

==> 'Yes,' said Harriet; 'that's the point. I mean, the fact is that I <==
_didn't_ do the murder, so that my feelings are quite irrelevant. If I
had done it, I should probably have thought myself thoroughly justified,
and been deeply indignant about the way I was treated. As it is, I still
think that to inflict the agonies of poisoning on anybody is
unpardonable. The particular trouble I got let in for was as much sheer

'I met him once at a dog-show,' put in Miss Armstrong unexpectedly. 'He
was giving a perfect imitation of the silly-ass-about-town.'

'Then he was either frightfully bored or detecting something,' said
==> Harriet, laughing. 'I know that frivolous mood, and it's mostly <==
camouflage--but one doesn't always know for what.'

'There must be something behind it,' said Miss Barton, 'because he's
obviously very intelligent. But is it only intelligence, or is there any
genuine feeling?'

coffee-cup, 'accuse him of any lack of feeling. I've seen him very much
upset, for instance, over convicting a sympathetic criminal. But he is
really rather reserved, in spite of that deceptive manner.'

'Perhaps he's shy,' suggested PhÅbe Tucker, kindly. 'People who talk a

really rather reserved, in spite of that deceptive manner.'

'Perhaps he's shy,' suggested PhÅbe Tucker, kindly. 'People who talk a
lot often are. I think they are very much to be pitied.'

==> 'Shy?' said Harriet. 'Well, hardly. Nervy, perhaps--that blessed word <==
covers a lot. But he doesn't exactly seem to call for pity.'

'Why should he?' said Miss Barton. 'In a very pitiful world, I don't see
much need to pity a young man who has everything he can possibly want.'

'He must be a remarkable person if he has that,' said Miss de Vine, with
a gravity that her eyes belied.

==> 'And he's not so young as all that,' said Harriet. 'He's forty-five.' <==
(This was Miss Barton's age.)

'I think it's rather an impertinence to pity people,' said the Dean.

'Hear, hear!' said Harriet. 'Nobody likes being pitied. Most of us enjoy

'Caustic,' said Miss de Vine, 'but painfully true.'

'But what I should like to know,' pursued Miss Barton, refusing to be

'But what I should like to know,' pursued Miss Barton, refusing to be
diverted, 'is whether this dilettante gentleman does anything, outside
his hobbies of detecting crimes and collecting books, and, I believe,
playing cricket in his off-time.'

==> Harriet, who had been congratulating herself upon the way in which she <==
was keeping her temper, was seized with irritation.

'I don't know,' she said. 'Does it matter? Why should he do anything
else? Catching murderers isn't a soft job, or a sheltered job. It takes
a lot of time and energy, and you may very easily get injured or killed.

terribly downright person, and she was determined to get all that off
her chest. She is a splendid person, but hasn't very much sense of
humour. She can't bear anything to be done except from the very loftiest
motives.'

==> Harriet apologised for having spoken so vehemently. <==

'I thought you took it all wonderfully well. And your Lord Peter sounds
a most interesting person. But I don't see why you should be forced to
discuss him, poor man.'

deal too much in this university. We argue about this and that and why
and wherefore, instead of getting the thing done.'

'But oughtn't we to ask what things we want done,' objected the Dean.

==> Harriet grinned at Betty Armstrong, hearing the familiar academic <==
wrangle begin. Before ten minutes had passed, somebody had introduced
the word 'values.' An hour later they were still at it. Finally the
Bursar was heard to quote:

'God made the integers; all else is the work of man.'

'I did, and I'm sorry for it. I call it a revolting little object.'

The Dean's emphatic tones reduced everybody to laughter, and, midnight
striking, the party broke up.

==> 'I am still living out of College,' said Miss de Vine to Harriet. 'May I <==
walk across to your room with you?'

Harriet assented, wondering what Miss de Vine had to say to her. They
stepped out together into the New Quad. The moon was up, painting the
buildings with cold washes of black and silver whose austerity rebuked

'Yes.' Miss de Vine smiled oddly. 'If you were to listen at those
windows, you would find it was the middle-aged ones who were making the
noise. The old have gone to bed, wondering whether they have worn as
badly as their contemporaries. They have suffered some shocks, and their

others. If you ever find a person who likes you in spite of it--still
more, because of it--that liking has very great value, because it is
perfectly sincere, and because, with that person, you will never need to
be anything but sincere yourself.'

==> 'That is probably very true,' said Harriet, 'but what makes you say it?' <==

'Not any desire to offend you, believe me. But I imagine you come across
a number of people who are disconcerted by the difference between what
you do feel and what they fancy you ought to feel. It is fatal to pay
the smallest attention to them.'

They had entered the Old Quad, and the ancient beeches, most venerable
of all Shrewsbury institutions, cast over them a dappled and changing
shadow-pattern that was more confusing than darkness.

one desire and another, how is one to know which things are really of
overmastering importance?'

'We can only know that,' said Miss de Vine, 'when they have overmastered
us.'

The chequered shadow dropped off them, like the dropping of linked
silver chains. Each after each, from all the towers of Oxford, clocks
struck the quarter-chime, in a fumbling cascade of friendly

Burleigh Building and vanished, with her long, stooping stride beneath
the Hall archway.

sadistic. It depicted a naked figure of exaggeratedly feminine outlines,
inflicting savage and humiliating outrage upon some person of
indeterminate gender clad in a cap and gown. It was neither sane nor
healthy; it was, in fact, a nasty, dirty and lunatic scribble.

==> Harriet stared at it for a little time in disgust, while a number of <==
questions formed themselves in her mind. Then she took it upstairs with
her into the nearest lavatory, dropped it in and pulled the plug on it.
That was the proper fate for such things, and there was an end of it;
but for all that, she wished she had not seen it.

one night to spare had all cleared off. People began to sort themselves
out, and one could talk to one's friends at leisure, without being
instantly collared and hauled away by a collection of bores.

reception with sherry and biscuits, and then went to call upon Miss
Lydgate in the New Quad. The English tutor's room was festooned with
proofs of her forthcoming work on the prosodic elements in English verse
from Beowulf to Bridges. Since Miss Lydgate had perfected, or was in
process of perfecting (since no work of scholarship ever attains a

Lydgate would be discovered by her pupils and colleagues wound into a
kind of paper cocoon and helplessly searching for her fountain-pen amid
the litter.

'I am afraid,' said Miss Lydgate, rubbing her head, in response to

ignorant about the practical side of bookmaking. I find it very
confusing and I'm not at all clever at explaining myself to the
printers. It will be a great help having Miss de Vine here. She has such
an orderly mind. It's really an education to see her manuscript, and of
course her work is far more intricate than mine--all sorts of little

that so difficult, and though Miss Harper is kindly doing all my typing
for me, she really knows more about Anglo-Saxon than about compositors.
I expect you remember Miss Harper. She was two years junior to you and
took a second in English and lives in the Woodstock Road.'

==> Harriet said she thought footnotes were always very tiresome, and might <==
she see some of the book.

'Well, if you're really interested,' said Miss Lydgate, 'but I don't
want to bore you.' She extracted a couple of paged sheets from a desk
stuffed with papers. 'Don't prick your fingers on that bit of manuscript

interlineations, but you see, I suddenly realised that I could work out
a big improvement in my notation, so I've had to alter it all through. I
expect,' she added wistfully, 'the printers will be rather angry with
me.'

==> Harriet privately agreed with her, but said comfortingly that the Oxford <==
University Press was no doubt accustomed to deciphering the manuscripts
of scholars.

'I sometimes wonder whether I am a scholar at all,' said Miss Lydgate.
'It's all quite clear in my head, you know, but I get muddled when I put

'It's all quite clear in my head, you know, but I get muddled when I put
it down on paper. How do you manage about your plots? All that
time-table work with the alibis and so on must be terribly hard to bear
in mind.'

==> 'I'm always getting mixed up myself,' admitted Harriet. 'I've never yet <==
succeeded in producing a plot without at least six major howlers.
Fortunately, nine readers out of ten get mixed up too, so it doesn't
matter. The tenth writes me a letter, and I promise to make the
correction in the second edition, but I never do. After all, my books
are only meant for fun; it's not like a work of scholarship.'

men's colleges come to call on the Warden, they really ought to be able
to get through the grounds without blushing. Miss Martin has really had
to insist on bathing dresses--backless if they like, but proper bathing
dresses made for the purpose, and not ordinary underwear.'

==> Harriet agreed that this seemed only reasonable. <==

'I am so glad you think so,' said Miss Lydgate. 'It is rather difficult
for us of the older generation to hold the balance between tradition and
progress--if it is progress. Authority as such commands very little
respect nowadays, and I expect that is a good thing on the whole, though

am sure you would like a cup of coffee. No, really--I always have one
myself about this time. Annie!--I think I hear my scout in the
pantry--Annie! Would you please bring in a second cup for Miss Vane.'

==> Harriet was fairly well satisfied already with eatables and drinkables, <==
but politely accepted the refreshment brought in by the smartly
uniformed maid. She made some remark, when the door was shut again, as
to the great improvements made since her own day in the staff and
service at Shrewsbury, and again heard the praise awarded to the new
Bursar.

so much temptation in the matter of parcels and so on. He was a most
hardworking man, but he would put money on horse-races, and so,
naturally, he found himself in difficulties. It was so unfortunate for
his wife.'

==> 'She was a good soul,' agreed Harriet. <==

'She was terribly upset about it all,' went on Miss Lydgate. 'And so, to
do him justice, was Jukes. He quite broke down, and there was a sad
scene with the Bursar when she told him he must go.'

were all very much distressed about it. Except, perhaps, the Dean--but

some of Padgett's quaint sayings.'

==> 'He looks a monument of integrity,' said Harriet. 'He may be less <==
popular, on that account. Jukes took bribes, you know--if one came in
late, and that sort of thing.'

'We were afraid he did,' said Miss Lydgate. 'Of course, it's a
responsible post for a man who isn't of very strong character. He'll do

linen. It all helps; and she's especially glad because that crippled
sister of hers can do part of the work and contribute something to their
small income. Agnes says the poor soul is so much happier now that she
need not feel herself a burden.'

==> Harriet marvelled, not for the first time, at the untiring <==
conscientiousness of administrative women. Nobody's interests ever
seemed to be overlooked or forgotten, and an endless goodwill made up
for a perennial scarcity of funds.

After a little more talk about the doings of past dons and students, the

the one funny old house with ten students, and were chaperoned to
lectures in a donkey-carriage. I must say we rather wept to see the dear
old place pulled down to make way for the Library. It held so many
memories.'

==> 'Yes, indeed,' said Harriet, sympathetically. She supposed that there <==
was no moment of the past upon which this experienced and yet innocent
soul could not dwell with unaffected pleasure. The entrance of another
old pupil cut short her interview with Miss Lydgate, and she went out,
vaguely envious, to encounter the persistent Miss Mollison, primed with
every remorseless detail of the clock incident. It gave her pleasure to

every remorseless detail of the clock incident. It gave her pleasure to
inform Miss Mollison that Mr. A. E. W. Mason had hit on the same idea
earlier. Unquenchable, Miss Mollison proceeded to question her victim
eagerly about Lord Peter Wimsey, his manners, customs and appearance;
and when Miss Mollison was driven away by Miss Schuster-Slatt, the

harangue about the sterilisation of the unfit, to which (it appeared) a

Miss Schuster-Slatt said she thought English husbands were lovely, and
that she was preparing a questionnaire to be circulated to the young men
of the United Kingdom, with a view to finding out their matrimonial
preferences.

==> 'But English people won't fill up questionnaires,' said Harriet. <==

'Won't fill up questionnaires?' cried Miss Schuster-Slatt taken aback.

'No,' said Harriet, 'they won't. As a nation we are not
questionnaire-conscious.'

whole question from the angle of British mentality.'

'I'm afraid you will find it a very difficult job. I wonder,' added
==> Harriet (for she felt she owed Miss Schuster-Slatt a riposte for her <==
unfortunate observations of the night before), 'whether your intentions
are as disinterested as you make out. Perhaps you are thinking of
investigating the loveliness of English husbands in a personal and
practical way.'

One would have thought that Oxford at least would offer a respite from
Peter Wimsey and the marriage question. But although she herself was a
notoriety, if not precisely a celebrity, it was an annoying fact that
Peter was a still more spectacular celebrity, and that, of the two,
people would rather know about him than about her. As regards

She wandered into the J.C.R. which was empty, but for one drab and

was preposterous. She broke in rather abruptly upon a complaint against

down with a lot of ideas about the dignity of labour. And besides, at
that time, my husband wouldn't have liked it much if I'd separated
myself from his interests. Of course, we didn't think it would turn out
like this.'

==> What damned waste! was all Harriet could say to herself. All that <==
brilliance, all that trained intelligence, harnessed to a load that any
uneducated country girl could have drawn, far better. The thing had its
compensations, she supposed. She asked the question bluntly.

Worth it? said Mrs. Bendick. Oh, yes, it was certainly worth it. The job

Worth it? said Mrs. Bendick. Oh, yes, it was certainly worth it. The job
was worth doing. One was serving the land. And that, she managed to
convey, was a service harsh and austere indeed, but a finer thing than
spinning words on paper.

==> 'I'm quite prepared to admit that,' said Harriet. 'A plough share is a <==
nobler object than a razor. But if your natural talent is for barbering,
wouldn't it be better to _be_ a barber, and a good barber--and use the
profits (if you like) to speed the plough? However grand the job may be,
is it _your_ job?'

different connection. Look here! I admire you like hell, but I believe
you're all wrong. I'm sure one should do one's own job, however trivial,
and not persuade one's self into doing somebody else's, however noble.'

persuasion.

'That's all very well,' replied Mrs. Bendick. 'But one's rather apt to
marry into somebody else's job.'

==> True; but Harriet was offered the opportunity of marrying into a job as <==
near her own as made no great difference. And into money enough to make
any job supererogatory. Again she saw herself unfairly provided with
advantages which more deserving people desired in vain.

'I suppose,' she said, 'marriage is the really important job isn't it?'

'You have, rather,' said Mrs. Bendick. 'But you have such a beautiful
voice to be rude in.'

'Our farm's on the Welsh border, and the people all speak in the most
hideous local sing-song. Do you know what makes me feel most home-sick

seized a plate of cold ham for herself, looked round for a lunch
partner, and was thankful to see PhÅbe Tucker just come in and being
helped by the attendant scout to a portion of cold roast beef. The two
joined forces, and sat down at the far end of a long table which ran
parallel to the High and at right angles to the other tables. From there

helped by the attendant scout to a portion of cold roast beef. The two
joined forces, and sat down at the far end of a long table which ran
parallel to the High and at right angles to the other tables. From there
they commanded the whole room, including the High Table itself and the
row of serving-hatches. As her eye wandered from one briskly occupied

these normal and cheerful-looking women had dropped that unpleasant
paper in the quad the night before? Because you never knew; and the
trouble of not knowing was that you dimly suspected everybody. Haunts of
ancient peace were all very well, but very odd things could crawl and
creep beneath lichen-covered stones. The Warden in her great carved

from the hatch and was now putting salad on her plate for her. Miss
Stevens, the Bursar, and Miss Shaw, the Modern Language Tutor, had
collected about them three other old students of considerable age and
attainments; their conversation was animated and apparently amusing.
Miss Pyke, the Classical Tutor, was deep in a discussion with a tall,

silence, the Tutor's high voice rang out unexpectedly: 'The tumulus at

Relegated to a remote table at the lower end of the Hall were
half-a-dozen present students, still lingering in Oxford for viva voce
examinations. They babbled continually among themselves, rather
obviously ignoring the invasion of their college by all these quaint old
freaks who were what they themselves would be in ten years' time, or
==> twenty or thirty. They were a badly-turned-out bunch, Harriet thought, <==
with an end-of-term crumpled appearance. There was an odd, shy-faced,
sandy girl with pale eyes and restless fingers, and next to her a dark,
beautiful one, for whose face men might have sacked cities, if it had
had any sort of animation; and there was a gawky and unfinished-looking
young person, very badly made up, who had a pathetic air of seeking to

young person, very badly made up, who had a pathetic air of seeking to
win hearts and never succeeding; and, most interesting of the bunch, a
girl with a face like eager flame who was dressed with a maddening
perversity of wrongness, but who one day would undoubtedly hold the
world in her hands for good or evil. The rest were nondescript, as yet
==> undifferentiated--yet nondescripts, thought Harriet, were the most <==
difficult of all human beings to analyse. You scarcely knew they were
there, until--bang! Something quite unexpected blew up like a depth
charge and left you marvelling, to collect strange floating debris.

So the Hall seethed, and the scouts looked on impassively from the

on the impenetrability of the human countenance.' She hesitated, on the
verge of telling PhÅbe about the disagreeable drawing, but her friend
went on to ask some other question, and the moment passed by.

But the episode had troubled and unsettled her. Passing through the

men. The great man, on the other hand, could marry where he liked, not
being restricted to great women; indeed, it was often found sweet and
commendable in him to choose a woman of no sort of greatness at all.

==> 'Though of course,' Harriet reminded herself, 'a woman may achieve <==
greatness, or at any rate great renown, by merely being a wonderful wife
and mother, like the mother of the Gracchi; whereas the men who have
achieved great renown by being devoted husbands and fathers might be
counted on the fingers of one hand. Charles I was an unfortunate king,

Somebody passed through the Hall behind her; it was Miss Hillyard. With
a mischievous determination to get some response out of this

historical thesis.

'You have forgotten physical achievements,' said Miss Hillyard. 'I
believe many female singers, dancers, Channel swimmers and tennis stars

Hillyard.

'Lor'!' said the Dean. 'That's Miss Hillyard's hobby-horse. Rubbidge, as

It had not, after all, been so bad. Definitely not so bad as one had
expected. Though it was melancholy to find that one had grown out of
Mary Stokes, and a little tiresome, in a way, that Mary Stokes refused
==> to recognise the fact. Harriet had long ago discovered that one could <==
not like people any the better, merely because they were ill, or
dead--still less because one had once liked them very much. Some happy
souls could go through life without making this discovery, and they were
the men and women who were called 'sincere.' Still, there remained old
friends whom one was glad to meet again, like the Dean and Phoebe

Rather inquisitive and silly about 'the man Wimsey,' some of them, but
no doubt with the best intentions. Miss Hillyard might be an exception,
but there had always been something a little twisted and uncomfortable
about Miss Hillyard.

==> As the car wound its way over the Chilterns, Harriet grinned to herself, <==
thinking of her parting conversation with the Dean and Bursar.

'Be sure and write us a new book soon. And remember, if ever we get a
mystery at Shrewsbury we shall call upon you to come and disentangle
it.'

and then she won't so much mind my hauling the murderess off to
justice.'

And suppose they actually did find a bloody corpse in the buttery, how

There was a message pasted across it, made up of letters cut apparently
from the headlines of a newspaper.

YOU DIRTY MURDERESS. AREN'T YOU ASHAMED TO SHOW YOUR FACE?

==> 'Hell!' said Harriet. 'Oxford, thou too?' She sat very still for a few <==
moments. Then she struck a match and set light to the paper. It burned
briskly, till she was forced to drop it upon her plate. Even then the
letters showed grey upon the crackling blackness, until she pounded
their spectral shapes to powder with the back of a spoon.

There are incidents in one's life which, through some haphazard
==> coincidence of time and mood, acquire a symbolic value. Harriet's <==
attendance at the Shrewsbury Gaudy was of this kind. In spite of minor
incongruities and absurdities, it had shown itself to have one definite
significance; it had opened up to her the vision of an old desire, long
obscured by a forest of irrelevant fancies, but now standing up
unmistakable, like a tower set on a hill. Two phrases rang in her ears:

powerful fetter which still tied her ineluctably to the bitter past?
What about Peter Wimsey?

During the past three years, their relations had been peculiar.
Immediately after the horrible business that they had investigated
==> together at Wilvercombe, Harriet--feeling that something must be done to <==
ease a situation which was fast becoming intolerable--had carried out a
long-cherished scheme, now at last made practicable by her increasing
reputation and income as a writer. Taking a woman friend with her as
companion and secretary, she had left England, and travelled slowly
about Europe, staying now here, now there, as fancy dictated or a good

young woman writer and her barrister husband--partly for fun and partly
because she wanted to get local colour for a short story, in which an
unhappy victim was due to fall suddenly dead in the Royal Enclosure,
just at the exciting moment when all eyes were glued upon the finish of
a race. Scanning those sacred precincts, therefore, from without the
==> pale, Harriet became aware that the local colour included a pair of slim <==
shoulders tailored to swooning-point and carrying a well-known parrot
profile, thrown into prominence by the acute backward slant of a
pale-grey topper. A froth of summer hats billowed about this apparition,
so that it resembled a slightly grotesque but expensive orchid in a
bouquet of roses. From the expressions of the parties, Harriet gathered

reassuring: the trouble was nothing but reaction--of frequent occurrence

patient had rung up, apologised, and made a fresh appointment, at which
he had displayed a quite remarkable effervescence of spirits.

==> On no other occasion had Harriet ever passed his threshold. Nor had he <==
ever violated the seclusion of Mecklenburg Square. Two or three times,
courtesy had moved her to invite him in; but he had always made some
excuse, and she understood that he was determined to leave her that
place, at least, free from any awkward associations. It was clear that
he had no fatuous intention of making himself more valued by withdrawal:

he had rather the air of trying to make amends for something. He renewed

might take dynamite for granted in a munitions factory. But the
discovery that the mere sound of his name still had the power to provoke
such explosions in herself--that she could so passionately resent, at
one and the same time, either praise or blame of him on other people's

away by Chief-Inspector Parker, who was in difficulties over a murder in

one frightful occasion, during the first year of their acquaintance,
when he had ventured to send her a Christmas present and she, in an
access of mortified pride, had returned it to him with a stinging
rebuke, he had been careful never to offer anything that could possibly
be looked upon as a material gift. Had he been wiped out of existence at

by reality. If she could succeed in standing aside from herself she
would achieve self-confidence and a better control. That was the great
possession in which--with all his limitations--the scholar could account
himself blessed: the single eye, directed to the object, not dimmed nor
distracted by private motes and beams. "Private, indeed?" muttered

paper.

'They frequently do.'

I'm quite offensively English myself, because I'm one-sixteenth French,
besides all the usual nationalities. So that compromise is in my blood.
However. Should you catalogue me as a heart or a brain?'

'Who denies it? And you may deny my heart, but I'm damned if you shall
deny its existence.'

it a special occasion. But we'll have coffee in the lounge, if you don't
mind, because this chair is getting as hard as the wheelbarrow, and

==> He got up cautiously. The waiter arrived and restored Harriet's bag, <==
together with some letters which she had taken from the postman as she
left the house and thrust into the outer pocket of the bag without
reading. Wimsey steered his guest into the lounge, established her in a
chair and lowered himself with a grimace into one corner of a low couch.

'More of your scattered belongings?' said Wimsey, as she took the

Shall I?'

minutes, and then said gently:

He sat up sharply, so that his exclamation of pleasure turned half-way
into an anguished grunt.

you? Give me your hand, and we'll fight on until we drop. Here! none of
that. You can't cry in this club. It's never been done, and if you

She heard no news of Shrewsbury College in the interval, except that one
day in the Michaelmas Term there was a paragraph in one of the more
foolish London dailies about an 'Undergraduettes' Rag,' informing the
world that somebody had made a bonfire of gowns in Shrewsbury Quad and
that the 'Lady Head' was said to be taking disciplinary measures. Women,
==> of course, were always news. Harriet wrote a tart letter to the paper, <==
pointing out that either 'undergraduate' or 'woman student' would be
seemlier English than 'undergraduette,' and that the correct method of
describing Dr. Baring was 'the Warden.' The only result of this was to
provoke a correspondence headed 'Lady Undergrads,' and a reference to
'sweet girl-graduates.'

attention was again called to college affairs in a way that was more
personal and more disquieting.

February was sobbing and blustering its lachrymose way into March, when
she received a letter from the Dean.

[line number in individual story] matching line = 2829    window = 2824 2834

been acquitted of murder, and it had undoubtedly never occurred to her
that to ask the notorious Miss Vane for advice about how to deal with
that kind of thing was to talk of rope in the house of the hanged. This
was merely an instance of that kind of unworldly tactlessness to which
learned and cloistered women were prone. The Dean would be horrified to
==> know that Harriet was the last person who should, in charity, have been <==
approached in the matter; and that, even in Oxford itself, in Shrewsbury
College itself--

In Shrewsbury College itself: and at the Gaudy. That was the point. The
letter she had found in her sleeve had been put there in Shrewsbury

[line number in individual story] matching line = 2853    window = 2848 2858

Oxford. While she waited for it, she thought the matter over in this new
light. The Dean had given no details about the poison letters, except
that they suggested a grudge against the S.C.R. and that the culprit
appeared to belong to the college. It was natural enough to attribute
destructive ragging to the undergraduates; but then, the Dean did not
==> know what Harriet knew. The warped and repressed mind is apt enough to <==
turn and wound itself. 'Soured virginity'--'unnatural
life'--'semi-demented spinsters'--'starved appetites and suppressed
impulses'--'unwholesome atmosphere'--she could think of whole sets of
epithets, ready-minted for circulation. Was this what lived in the tower
set on the hill? Would it turn out to be like Lady Athaliah's tower in

garments rolled in blood--and, she reflected drearily, with the usual
war aftermath of a debased coinage, a lowered efficiency and unstable
conditions of government.

At this point the Oxford call came through, with the Dean's voice
==> sounding full of agitation. Harriet, after hurriedly disclaiming all <==
pretence to detective ability in real life, expressed concern and
sympathy and then asked the question that, to her, was of prime
importance.

'How are the letters written?'

thought it must be somebody who had a personal grudge against her. But
several people got them shortly afterwards, so we decided it couldn't be
that. We'd never had anything of that sort happening before, so just at
present we're inclined to check up on the First Year students.'

==> The one set of people that it can't possibly be, thought Harriet. She <==
only said, however:

'It doesn't do to take too much for granted. People may go on quite all
right for a time, till something sets them off. The whole difficulty
with these things is that the person generally behaves quite normally in

I'm so terrified about next week! Poor Lord Oakapple, coming to open the
Library, with venomous asps simply _dripping_ poison over his boots!
Suppose they send _him_ something!'

==> 'Well,' said Harriet, 'I think I'll come along next week. There's a very <==
good reason why I'm not quite the right person to handle this, but on
the other hand, I think I ought to come. I'll tell you why when we
meet.'

'It's terribly good of you. I'm sure you'll be able to suggest

something. I suppose you'll want to see all the specimens there are.
Yes? Very well. Every fragment shall be cherished next our hearts. Do we
handle them with the tongs for the better preservation of
finger-prints?'

==> Harriet doubted whether finger-prints would be of much service, but <==
advised that precautions should be taken on principle. When she had rung
off, with the Dean's reiterated thanks still echoing from the other end
of the line, she sat for a few moments with the receiver in her hand.
Was there any quarter to which she might usefully turn for advice? There
was; but she was not eager to discuss the subject of anonymous letters,

letters about an obscure and complicated little affair in an Oxford
college, especially when one's correspondent was urgently engaged in
investigating something else all over Europe. The call must have been
urgent, for the note was very ill and hastily written, and looked, in
fact, as though it had been scribbled at the last moment in a taxi.
==> Harriet amused herself with wondering whether the Prince of Ruritania <==
had been shot, or the Master-Crook of the Continent had brought off a
fresh _coup_, or whether this was the International Conspiracy to Wreck
Civilisation with a Death-Ray--all those situations being frequent in
her kind of fiction. Whatever it was all about, she would have to carry
on unaided and find consolation in a proper independence of spirit.

==> Harriet drove out to Oxford through a vile downpour of sleet that forced <==
its way between the joints of the all-weather curtains and kept the
windscreen-wiper hard at work. Nothing could have been less like her
journey of the previous June; but the greatest change of all was in her
own feelings. Then, she had been reluctant and uneasy; a prodigal
daughter without the romantic appeal of husks and very uncertain of the

have your bag up in half a moment, miss; only I can't leave the gate
till Mrs. Padgett comes back from running over to the Buttery, or I'm
sure I'd show you the way myself.'

'Oh, it's quite easy when you know, miss. But what with pulling down
here and building up there and altering this and that, there's a many of

==> Having had tea with the Dean, Harriet found herself seated in the Senior <==
Common Room at an informal meeting of the Fellows and Tutors, presided
over by the Warden. Before her lay the documents in the case--a pitiful
little heap of dirty imaginations. Fifteen or so of them had been
collected for inspection. There were half-a-dozen drawings, all much of
the same kind as the one she had picked up on the Gaudy night. There

that the nuisance was, so far, confined to Shrewsbury.

Since nothing, so far, had come to light to show that the persecution
had started before the previous October, suspicion rather naturally
centred upon the First-Year students. It was when Dr. Baring had reached
==> this point of her exposition that Harriet felt obliged to speak. <==

'I am afraid, Warden,' she said, 'that I am in a position to rule out
the First Year, and in fact the majority of the present students
altogether.'

'I am afraid,' said Miss Allison, 'we shall have to allow for what I
understand is the well-known practice of these unfortunate--um,
ah--anonymous-letter writers, of sending letters to themselves to
distract suspicion. Isn't that so, Miss Vane?'

==> 'Yes,' said Harriet, bluntly. 'It seems unlikely, on the face of it, <==
that anybody would do herself the kind of material damage Miss Lydgate
has received; but if we once begin to make distinctions it is difficult
to know where to stop. I don't think anything but a plain alibi ought to
be accepted as evidence.'

Chilperic's room before I left; so that I might quite easily have taken
the manuscript from the Library then.'

'But you have an alibi for the time when the proofs were put in the
==> S.C.R.,' said Harriet. <==

'No,' said Miss Lydgate; 'not even that, I came by the early train and
arrived when everybody was in Chapel. I should have had to be rather
quick to run across and throw the proofs into the S.C.R. and be back in
my rooms again before the discovery was made; but I suppose I _could_

Wasn't she still up?'

'Yes,' said Miss Hillyard, 'she was.'

'They will be in their Second and Third Years now, I suppose,' said
==> Harriet. 'By the way, is it known who "young Farringdon" is, in this <==
note addressed to Miss Flaxman?'

'There's the point,' said the Dean. 'Young Farringdon is an
undergraduate of--New College, I think it is--who was engaged to
Cattermole when they both came up, but is now engaged to Flaxman.'

'Mainly, I understand, or partly, in consequence of that letter. I am
told that Miss Flaxman accused Miss Cattermole of sending it and showed
it to Mr. Farringdon; with the result that the gentleman broke off the
engagement and transferred his affections to Flaxman.'

==> 'Not pretty,' said Harriet. <==

'No. But I don't think the Cattermole engagement was ever anything much
more than a family arrangement, and that the new deal was not much more
than an open recognition of the _fait accompli_. I gather there has been
some feeling in the Second Year about the whole thing.'

'The question remains,' said Miss Pyke, 'what steps do we propose to
take in the matter? We have asked Miss Vane's advice, and personally I
am prepared to agree--particularly in view of what we have heard this
evening--that it is abundantly necessary that some outside person should

undesirable. But may I ask whether, at this stage, it is suggested that
Miss Vane should personally undertake an investigation? Or
alternatively, would she propose our placing the matter in the hands of
a private inquiry agent? Or what?'

==> 'I feel I am in a very awkward position,' said Harriet. 'I am willing to <==
give any help I can; but you do realise, don't you, that this kind of
inquiry is apt to take a long time, especially if the investigator has
to tackle it single-handed. A place like this, where people run in and
out everywhere at all hours is almost impossible to police or patrol
efficiently. It would need quite a little squad of inquiry agents--and

'Is there no material evidence to be obtained from an examination of the
documents themselves?' asked Miss Pyke. 'Speaking for myself, I am quite
ready to have my finger-prints taken or to undergo any other kind of
precautionary measure that may be considered necessary.'

==> 'I'm afraid,' said Harriet, 'the evidence of finger-prints isn't quite <==
so easy a matter as we make it appear in books. I mean, we could take
finger-prints, naturally, from the S.C.R. and, possibly, from the
scouts--though they wouldn't like it much. But I should doubt very much
whether rough scribbling-paper like this would show distinguishable
prints. And besides--'

'You see what I meant,' said the Warden, 'when I said that it was better
not to discuss methods of investigation too freely.'

'How many people have handled all these documents already?' inquired
==> Harriet. <==

'Ever so many, I should think,' said the Dean.

'But could not a search be made for--' began Miss Chilperic. She was the
most junior of the dons; a small, fair and timid young woman,

'Please, Miss Chilperic. That is the kind of suggestion that ought not
to be made here. It might convey a warning.'

'This,' said Miss Hillyard, 'is an intolerable position.' She looked
==> angrily at Harriet, as though she were responsible for the position; <==
which, in a sense, she was.

'It seems to me,' said the Treasurer, 'that, now that we have asked Miss
Vane to come and give us her advice, it is impossible for us to take it,
or even to hear what it is. The situation is rather Gilbertian.'

or even to hear what it is. The situation is rather Gilbertian.'

'We shall have to be frank up to a point,' said the Warden. 'Do you
advise the private inquiry agent, Miss Vane?'

==> 'Not the ordinary sort,' said Harriet; 'you wouldn't like them at all. <==
But I do know of an organisation where you could get the right type of
person and the greatest possible discretion.'

For she had remembered that there was a Miss Katherine Climpson, who ran
what was ostensibly a Typing Bureau but was in fact a useful

The Treasurer coughed.

'Fees paid to a Detective Agency,' she observed, 'will have an odd
appearance in the Annual Audit.'

==> I think that might be arranged,' said Harriet. 'I know the organisation <==
personally. A fee might not be necessary.'

'That,' said the Warden, 'would not be right. The fees would, of course,
have to be paid. I would gladly be personally responsible.'


[line number in individual story] matching line = 3477    window = 3472 3482

have to be paid. I would gladly be personally responsible.'

'That would not be right either,' said Miss Lydgate. 'We certainly
should not like that.'

==> 'Perhaps,' suggested Harriet, 'I could find out what the fees were <==
likely to be.' She had, in fact, no idea how this part of the business
was worked.

'There would be no harm in inquiring,' said the Warden. 'In the
meantime--'

person in this room who cannot possibly come under suspicion. Perhaps
she would like to sleep upon the matter and make a report to you in the
morning. At least, not in the morning, because of Lord Oakapple and the
Opening; but at some time during to-morrow.'

==> 'Very well,' said Harriet, in response to an inquiring look from the <==
Warden. 'I will do that. And if I can think of any way in which I can be
helpful, I'll do my best.'

The Warden thanked her. 'We all appreciate,' she added, 'the extreme
awkwardness of the situation, and I am sure we shall all do what we can

keep an entirely open mind, and I shall look to all my colleagues to do
the same.'

The dons assented; and the meeting broke up.

==> '_Well!_' said the Dean, as she and Harriet turned into the New Quad, <==
'that is the most uncomfortable meeting I have ever had to sit through.
My dear, you _have_ thrown a bombshell into our midst!'

'I'm afraid so. But what could I do?'

busting?'

'We'll hope so. And of course there are these two students and the
scouts to be disposed of.' They turned in at the Dean's door. Miss
Martin savagely poked up the fire in the sitting-room, sat down in an
==> armchair and stared at the leaping flames. Harriet coiled herself on a <==
couch and contemplated Miss Martin.

'Look here,' said the Dean; 'you had better not tell me too much about
what _you_ think, but there's no reason why any of us shouldn't tell
_you_ what _we_ think, is there? No. Well. Here's the point. What is the

throw furniture about and the servants who pretend to be ghosts. And,
talking of servants, do you think there's anything in that idea that
it's more likely to be somebody of that class? Of course, Miss Barton
wouldn't agree; but after all, some of the words used are very coarse.'

==> 'Yes,' said Harriet; 'but actually there isn't one that I, for example, <==
don't know the meaning of. I believe, when you get even the primmest
people under an anaesthetic, they are liable to bring the strangest
vocabulary out of the subconscious--in fact, the primmer the coarser.'

'True. Did you notice that there wasn't a single spelling mistake in the

'I see. Does this tend to exclude the scouts?... But probably they spell
far better than we do. They so often _are_ better educated. And I'm sure
they dress better. But that's rather off the point. Stop me when I
dither.'

==> 'You're not dithering,' said Harriet. 'Everything you say is perfectly <==
true. At present I don't see how anybody is to be excluded.'

'And _what_,' demanded the Dean, 'becomes of the mutilated newspapers?'

'This won't do,' said Harriet; 'you're being a great deal too sharp

'Well, we've been into that,' said the Dean, in a tone of satisfaction.
'We've checked up on all the S.C.R. and J.C.R. papers ever since this
business came to our notice--that is, more or less, since the beginning

'Miss Parsons been here long?'

'Four years.'

==> Harriet noted down the names of Mrs. Goodwin and Miss Parsons. <==

'I think,' she said, 'for Mrs. Goodwin's own sake we'd better have a
second check on those newspapers. Not that it really matters; because,
if the poison-pen knows that the papers are being checked, she won't use
those papers. And I suppose she must know, because of the care taken to

'We don't know whether that was part of the same business or not. About
ten or a dozen people had left their gowns in various places--as they
do, you know--before Sunday supper. Some were in the Queen Elizabeth
portico, and some at the foot of the Hall stairs and so on. People bring
==> them over and dump them, ready for evening Chapel.' (Harriet nodded; <==
Sunday evening Chapel was held at a quarter to eight, and was
compulsory; being also a kind of College Meeting for the giving-out of
notices.) 'Well, when the bell started, these people couldn't find their
gowns and so couldn't go in to Chapel. Everybody thought it was just a
rag. But in the middle of the night somebody saw a blaze in the quad,

of day. Well--I suppose I'd better go and wash-and-brush-up for Hall.'

Hall was an embarrassed meal at the High Table. The conversation was
valiantly kept to matters of academic and world interest. The
undergraduates babbled noisily and cheerfully; the shadow that rested
==> upon the college did not seem to have affected their spirits. Harriet's <==
eye roamed over them.

'Is that Miss Cattermole at the table on the right? In a green frock,
with a badly made-up face?'

'I suppose,' said Miss Pyke, who had overheard the last remark, 'even
murderers look much like other people, Miss Vane. Or do you hold any
opinions about the theories put forward by Lombroso? I understand that
they are now to a considerable extent exploded.'

Vulgar letters--yes, possibly. But damaging those proofs was an educated

important thing is to get to the bottom of the mystery as quickly as
possible; and a trained detective or two would be very much more

balanced opinions than certain people here. I don't think I need say
more than that, need I?'

==> Harriet's next visit was to Miss Lydgate; her excuse being to inquire <==
what she should do with the mutilated proofs in her possession. She
found the English Tutor patiently correcting a small pile of students'
essays.

'Come in, come in,' said Miss Lydgate, cheerfully. 'I have nearly done

irrecoverable. I shall have to verify all the references again in
Elkbottom. It's so tiresome, especially as one is always so busy towards
the end of term. But it's all my own fault for not keeping a proper
record of everything.'

==> 'I wonder,' said Harriet, 'if I could be of any help to you in getting <==
the proofs put together. I'd gladly stay up for a week or so if it would
do any good, I'm quite used to juggling with proof-sheets, and I think I
can remember enough of my Schools work to be reasonably intelligent
about the Anglo-Saxon and Early English.'

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 108138    window = 108133 108143


about the Anglo-Saxon and Early English.'

'That would be a tremendous help!' exclaimed Miss Lydgate, her face
lighting up. 'But wouldn't it be trespassing far too much on your time?'

==> Harriet said, No; she was well ahead with her own work and would enjoy <==
putting in a little time on _English Prosody_. It was in her mind that
if she really meant to pursue inquiries at Shrewsbury, Miss Lydgate's
proofs would offer a convenient excuse for her presence in College.

The suggestion was left there for the moment. As regards the author of

[line number in individual story] matching line = 3903    window = 3898 3908

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 108147    window = 108142 108152



The suggestion was left there for the moment. As regards the author of
the outrages, Miss Lydgate could make no suggestions; except that,
whoever it was, the poor creature must be mentally afflicted.

==> As she left Miss Lydgate's room, Harriet encountered Miss Hillyard, who <==
was descending the staircase from her own abode.

'Well,' said Miss Hillyard, 'how is the investigation progressing? But I
ought not to ask that. You have contrived to cast the Apple of Discord
among us with a vengeance. However, as you are so well accustomed to the

ought not to ask that. You have contrived to cast the Apple of Discord
among us with a vengeance. However, as you are so well accustomed to the
receipt of anonymous communications, you are no doubt the fittest person
to handle the situation.'

==> 'In my case,' said Harriet, 'I only got what was to some extent <==
deserved. But this is a very different matter. It's not the same problem
at all. Miss Lydgate's book could offend nobody.'

'Except some of the men whose theories she has attacked,' replied Miss
Hillyard. 'However, circumstances seem to exclude the male sex from the

[line number in individual story] matching line = 3931    window = 3926 3936

sarcastically. 'It is quite ridiculous for the Bursar to talk about
locked gates. What is to prevent a man from concealing himself about the
grounds before the gates are locked and escaping again when they are
opened in the morning? Or climbing the walls, if it comes to that?'

==> Harriet thought the theory far-fetched; but it interested her, as <==
evidence of the speaker's prejudice, which amounted almost to obsession.

'The thing that in my opinion points to a man,' went on Miss Hillyard,
'is the destruction of Miss Barton's book, which is strongly
pro-feminist. I don't suppose you have read it; probably it would not

'The thing that in my opinion points to a man,' went on Miss Hillyard,
'is the destruction of Miss Barton's book, which is strongly
pro-feminist. I don't suppose you have read it; probably it would not
interest you. But why else should that book be picked out?'

==> Harriet parted from Miss Hillyard at the corner of the quad and went <==
over to Tudor Building. She had not very much doubt who it was that was
likely to offer opposition to her inquiries. If one was looking for a
twisted mind, Miss Hillyard's was certainly a little warped. And, when
one came to think of it, there was no evidence whatever that Miss
Lydgate's proofs had ever been taken to the Library or ever left Miss

anxious that it should _not_ be brought into court; and on that account
I am against hiring detectives of any kind. If you are able to get to
the bottom of it, I am ready to give you any help I can.'

==> Harriet thanked the Fellow for her good opinion and for the book. <==

'You are probably the best psychologist here,' said Harriet. 'What do
you think of it?'

'Probably the usual thing: a morbid desire to attract attention and

create a public uproar. The adolescent and the middle-aged are the most
likely suspects. I should very much doubt whether there is much more to
it than that. Beyond, I mean, that the incidental obscenities point to
some kind of sexual disturbance. But that is a commonplace in cases of
this kind. But whether you ought to look for a man-hater or a man-trap,'

seen in her, 'I can't tell you.'

thought it was time to go and see the Dean. She found Miss Burrows with
her, very tired and dusty after coping with the Library, and being
refreshed with a glass of hot milk, to which Miss Martin insisted on
adding just a dash of whisky to induce slumber.

adding just a dash of whisky to induce slumber.

'What new light one gets on the habits of the S.C.R. when one's an old

bottle of ardent spirits in the college, kept under lock and key by the
Bursar for life-and-death emergencies.'

'It used to be so,' said the Dean, 'but I'm getting frivolous in my old

'It used to be so,' said the Dean, 'but I'm getting frivolous in my old

high-days and holidays. The Bursar is even thinking of laying down a
little port for the College.'

==> 'Great Scott!' said Harriet. <==

'The students are not supposed to imbibe alcohol,' said the Dean, 'but I
shouldn't like to go bail for the contents of all the cupboards in
College.'

'Drat their young men,' said the Dean. 'In my day, we simply thirsted
for responsibility. We'd all been sat on at school for the good of our
souls, and came up bursting to show how brilliantly we could organise
things when we were put in charge.'

==> 'If you ask me,' said Harriet, 'it's the fault of the schools. Free <==
discipline and so on. Children are sick to death of running things and
doing prefect duty; and when they get up to Oxford they're tired out and
only want to sit back and let somebody else run the show. Even in my
time, the people from the up-to-date republican schools were shy of
taking office, poor brutes.'

be done to-morrow.'

'Twelve o'clock; reception in the S.C.R. and show him round the College.
Then lunch in Hall, and I hope he enjoys it. Ceremony at 2.30. And then
push him off to catch the 3.45. Delightful man; but I am getting fed up

bedside lamp. 'It's disquieting to reflect that one's dreams never
symbolise one's real wishes, but always something Much Worse.' She
turned the light on and sat up.

bearing their names: Miss H. Brown, Miss Jones, Miss Colburn, Miss
Szleposky, Miss Isaacson--so many unknown quantities. So many destined
wives and mothers of the race; or, alternatively, so many potential
historians, scientists, school-teachers, doctors, lawyers; as you liked
to think one thing of more importance than the other. At the end of the
==> passage was a large window, hygienically open at top and bottom. Harriet <==
gently pushed up the bottom sash and looked out, shivering.

And suddenly she knew that whatever reason or instinct had led her to
look at the Library had taken a very just view of the situation. The New
Library should have been quite dark. It was not. One of the long windows

And suddenly she knew that whatever reason or instinct had led her to
look at the Library had taken a very just view of the situation. The New
Library should have been quite dark. It was not. One of the long windows
was split from top to bottom by a narrow band of light.

==> Harriet thought rapidly. If this was Miss Burrows, carrying on <==
legitimately (though at an unreasonable and sacrificial hour) with her
preparations, why had she troubled to draw the curtains? The windows had
been curtained, because a Library that faces south must have some
protection against strong sunlight. But it would be absurd for the
Librarian to protect herself and her proper functions from scrutiny in

on one's own, or rouse somebody else?

One thing was clear; if it was a member of the S.C.R. lurking behind
those curtains, it would not be politic to bring a student to witness
the discovery. What dons slept in Tudor? Without consulting the list,

but on the far side of the building. Here was an opportunity to check up
on them, at any rate. With a last glance at the Library window, Harriet
made her way quickly back past her own room on the Bridge and through
into the main building. She cursed herself for not having a torch; she
was delayed by fumbling with the switches. Along the corridor, past the

She was leaving all the passage-lights burning behind her, and wondered
whether they would arouse attention in other buildings. At last. A door
on her left labelled 'Miss Barton.' And the door stood open.

She knocked at it sharply, and went in. The sitting-room was empty.
==> Beyond it, the bedroom door stood open too. 'Gracious!' said Harriet. <==
'Miss Barton!' There was no reply; and looking in, she saw that the
bedroom was as empty as the sitting-room. The bed-clothes were flung
back and the bed had been slept in; but the sleeper had risen and gone.

It was easy to think of an innocent explanation. Harriet stood for a

==> It was easy to think of an innocent explanation. Harriet stood for a <==
moment, considering; and then called to mind that the window of the room
overlooked the quad. The curtains were drawn back; she looked out into
the darkness. The light still shone in the Library window; but while she
looked, it went out.

She ran back to the foot of the stair and through the entrance-hall. The
front door of the building was ajar. She pulled it open and ran out and
across the quad. As she ran, something seemed to loom up ahead of her.
She made for it and closed with it. It caught her in a muscular grip.

==> 'Who's that?' demanded Harriet, fiercely. <==

'And who's _that_?'

The grip of one hand was released and a torch was switched on in
Harriet's face.

between, that led into the Hall. On the right was the long blank wall
between the passage and the kitchens. And ahead of her, at the far end
of the passage, close to the Buttery door, stood somebody clutching a
dressing-gown about her with one hand and a large jar in the other.

to meet her. Its features seemed familiar, and in a moment she
identified them. It was Miss Hudson, the Third Year student who had been
up at Gaudy.

'What in the world are you doing here at this time of night?' demanded

'What in the world are you doing here at this time of night?' demanded

students about their movements. Nor did she feel that her own
appearance, in pyjamas and a jaeger dressing-gown, suggested dignity or
authority. Miss Hudson, indeed, seemed quite flabbergasted at being thus
accosted by a total stranger at three in the morning. She stared,
speechless.

'Why shouldn't I be here?' said Miss Hudson, at last, defiantly. 'I
don't know who you are. I've as much right to walk about as you have ...
Oh, gosh!' she added, and burst out laughing. 'I suppose you're one of
the scouts. I didn't recognise you without your uniform.'

==> 'No,' said Harriet, 'I'm an old student. You're Miss Hudson, aren't you? <==
But your room isn't here. Have you been along to the Buttery?' Her eyes
were on the jug; Miss Hudson blushed.

'Yes--I wanted some milk. I've got an essay.'

'So that still goes on, does it? Carrie's just as soft-hearted as Agnes

firmly locked as the hatch. Then she went on, through the Fiction
Library, which was empty, and put her hand on the handle of the oak door
that led to the New Library.

The door was immovable. There was no key in the lock. Harriet looked

round the Fiction Library. On the window-sill lay a thin pencil, beside
a book and a few papers. She pushed the pencil into the key-hole; it
encountered no resistance.

She went to the window of the Fiction Library and pushed it up. It

The other door's locked, and the key gone.'

'That's awkward. If either of us goes, somebody may come out. And if we
yell for help there'll be an uproar.'

==> 'That's about the size of it,' said Harriet. <==

'Well, listen; I'll try and get in through one of the ground-floor
windows. They all seem to be latched, but I might break a pane of
glass.'

==> Harriet waited. Presently she heard a faint tinkle. Then there was a <==
pause, and presently the sound of a moving sash. There was a longer
pause. Harriet came back into the Fiction Library and pulled the table
away from the door. In about six or seven minutes' time she saw the door
handle move and heard a tap on the other side of the oak. She stooped to
the key-hole, and called: 'What's up?' and bent her ear to listen.

She hurried back through the Hall and round to the front of the Library.
Here she found the window that Miss Barton had opened, climbed through
and ran on up the stairs into the Library.

==> 'Well!' said Harriet. <==

The New Library was a handsome, lofty room, with six bays on the South
side, lit by as many windows running nearly from the floor to the
ceiling. On the North side, the wall was windowless, and shelved to a
height of ten feet. Above this was a space of blank wall, along which it

inscriptions in letters a foot high, all of the most unseemly sort. A
pair of library steps and a pot of paint with a wide brush in it stood
triumphantly in the midst of the wreckage, to show how the
transformation had been accomplished.

==> 'That's torn it,' said Harriet. <==

'Yes,' said Miss Barton. 'A very nice reception for Lord Oakapple.'

There was an odd note in her voice--almost of satisfaction. Harriet
looked sharply at her.

looked sharply at her.

'What are you going to do? What does one do? Go over the place with a
magnifying glass? or send for the police?'

==> 'Neither,' said Harriet. She considered for a moment. <==

'The first thing,' she said, 'is to send for the Dean. The next is to
find either the original keys or a spare set. The third, is to clean off
these filthy inscriptions before anybody sees them. And the fourth is to
get the room straight before twelve o'clock. There's plenty of time.

'H'm!' said the Fellow. 'I like people who know their own minds.'

She went with surprising promptness.

==> 'Her dressing-gown is all over paint,' said Harriet aloud to herself. <==
'But she may have got it climbing in.' She went downstairs and examined
the open window. 'Yes, here's where she scrambled over the wet radiator.
I expect I'm marked too. Yes, I am. Nothing to show whether it all came
from there. Damp footmarks--hers and mine, no doubt. Wait a moment.'

intruder would probably have had time to dry. Whoever it was must have
begun operations very soon after midnight at latest. The paint had
splashed about a good deal; if it were possible to search the whole
college for paint-stained clothing, well and good. But it would cause a
terrific scandal. Miss Hudson--had she shown any marks of paint
==> anywhere? Harriet thought not. <==

She looked about her again, and realised unexpectedly that she had the
lights full on, and that the curtains were drawn open. If anybody was
looking across from one of the other buildings, the interior of the room
would show up like a lighted stage. She snapped the lights off, and drew

world, _except_ one's own work. But on the other hand, if one were
cunning enough to see that people would think exactly that, then one
would promptly take the precaution of seeing that one's own work did
suffer.'

==> Harriet moved slowly about the Library. There was a big splash of paint <==
on the parquet. And at the edge of it--oh, yes! it would be very useful
to hunt the place over for paint-stained clothes. But here was evidence
that the culprit had worn no slippers. Why should she have worn
anything? The radiators on this floor were working at full blast, and a
complete absence of clothing would be not merely politic but

anything? The radiators on this floor were working at full blast, and a
complete absence of clothing would be not merely politic but
comfortable.

And how had the person got away? Neither Miss Hudson (if she was to be
==> trusted) nor Harriet had met anyone on the way up. But there had been <==
plenty of time for escape, after the lights were put out. A stealthy
figure creeping away under the Hall archway could not have been seen
from the far side of the Old Quad. Or, if it came to that, there might
quite well have been somebody lurking in the Hall while Harriet and Miss
Hudson were talking in the passage.

Miss Barton re-entered with the Dean, who took one look round and said
'Mercy!' She looked like a stout little mandarin, with her long red
pigtail and quilted blue dressing-gown sprawled over with

pigtail and quilted blue dressing-gown sprawled over with
green-and-scarlet dragons. 'What _idiots_ we were not to expect it. Of
course, the _obvious_ thing! If we'd only thought about it, Miss Burrows
could have locked up before she went. And _what_ do we do now?'

==> 'My first reaction,' said Harriet, 'is turpentine. And the second is <==
Padgett.'

'My dear, you are perfectly right. Padgett will cope. He always does.
Like charity, he never fails. What a mercy you people spotted what was
going on. As soon as we get these disgusting inscriptions cleaned off,

[line number in individual story] matching line = 4495    window = 4490 4500

we can put on a coat of quick-drying distemper or something, or paper
the wall over, and--goodness! I don't know where the turpentine will
come from, unless the painters have left a lot. It'll need a young bath.
But Padgett will manage.'

==> I'll run over and get him,' said Harriet, 'and at the same time I'll <==
collar Miss Burrows. We'll have to get these books back into place.
What's the time? Five to four, I think it can be done all right. Will
you hold the fort till I come back?'

'Yes. Oh, and you'll find the main door open now. I had an extra key,

                 *        *        *        *        *

The most remarkable thing about that remarkable morning was the
==> imperturbability of Padgett. He answered Harriet's summons attired in a <==
handsome pair of striped pyjamas, and received her instructions with
monumental stolidity.

'The Dean is sorry to say, Padgett, that somebody has been playing some
very disagreeable tricks in the New Library.'

[line number in individual story] matching line = 4541    window = 4536 4546

                 *        *        *        *        *

==> Harriet's next job was to collect Miss Burrows, who received the news <==
with loud expressions of annoyance.

'How loathsome! And do you mean to say all those books have got to be
done _again_? Now? Oh, lord, yes--I suppose there's no help for it. What
a blessing I hadn't put the Folio Chaucer and the other valuables in the

show-cases, Lord!'

==> The Librarian scrambled out of bed. Harriet looked at her feet. They <==
were quite clean. But there was an odd smell in the bedroom. She traced
it after a moment or two to the neighbourhood of the permanent basin.

'I say--is that turps?'

'I wish you'd lend it me. We had to scramble in through the window over
a wet radiator.'

'Yes, rather.'

==> Harriet went out, puzzled. Why should Miss Burrows have bothered to <==
bring the can over to the New Quad, when she could have cleaned off the
paint on the spot? But she could well understand that if anyone had
wanted to remove paint from her feet, after being disturbed in the
middle of a piece of dirty work, there might have been nothing for it
but to snatch up the can and bolt for it.

paint-stained feet into slippers, the slippers ought to show signs of
it.

She went back to her own room and dressed. Then she returned to the New
Quad. Miss Burrows had gone. Her bedroom slippers lay by the bed.
==> Harriet examined them minutely, inside and out, but they were quite free <==
from paint.

On her way back again, Harriet overtook Padgett. He was walking sedately
across the lawn, carrying a large can of turpentine in each hand.

==> Some time later, Harriet and the Dean, decorously robed and gowned, <==
found themselves passing along the East side of Queen Elizabeth Building
in the wake of Padgett and the decorators' foreman.

'Young ladies,' Padgett was heard to say, 'will 'ave their larks, same
as young gentlemen.'

frown, the tension became so acute that she nearly dropped the
sugar-basin. It turned out, however, that he had merely mislaid a Greek
quotation. The Warden, though the history of the Library was known to
her, displayed her usual serene poise.

==> Harriet saw nothing of all this. She spent the whole interval, after the <==
decorators had done their part, in the Library, watching the movements
of every one who came in or out, and seeing that they left nothing
undesirable behind them.

Apparently, however, the College Poltergeist had shot its bolt. A cold

undesirable behind them.

Apparently, however, the College Poltergeist had shot its bolt. A cold
lunch was brought up to the self-appointed invigilator. A napkin covered
it; but nothing lurked beneath its folds beyond a plate of ham
==> sandwiches and other such harmless matter. Harriet recognised the scout. <==

'It's Annie, isn't it? Are you on the kitchen staff now?'

'No. madam, I wait upon the Hall and Senior Common Room.'

'Yes, madam. How kind of you to ask.' Annie's face beamed with pleasure.
'They're splendid. Oxford suits them, after living in a manufacturing
town, where we were before. Are you fond of children, madam?'

==> 'Oh, yes,' said Harriet. Actually, she did not care much about children; <==
but one can scarcely say so, bluntly, to those possessed of these
blessings.

'You ought to be married and have some of your own, madam. There! I
oughtn't to have said that--it's not my place. But it seems to me a

'Well, Annie, it's all according to taste. And one has to wait for the
right person to come along.'

husband had been queer, or committed suicide, or something unfortunate,
and wondered whether her commonplace had been a tactful one. But Annie
seemed quite pleased with it. She smiled again; she had large, light

a women's college, Annie?'

The scout's face clouded. 'Well, madam, I've had my misfortunes. I was
glad to take what I could get.'

don't you think, madam? Funny, I mean. No heart in them.'

Hillyard.

'Oh, no,' she said briskly. 'Of course they are very busy people, and
haven't much time for outside interests. But they are all very kind.'

'What do you mean by that, Annie?'

'Nothing at all, madam. Only funny things go on sometimes, but of

mention them--being only a servant, nowadays.'

of the kind you suggest to outside people or visitors. If you have any
complaint to make, you should speak to the Bursar, or the Warden.'

'I haven't any complaint, madam. But you may have heard about rude words

being written up on the walls, and about the things that were burnt in
the Quad--why, there was a bit in the papers about that. Well you'll
find, madam, they all happened since a certain person came into the
college.'

==> 'What person?' said Harriet sternly. <==

'One of these learned ladies, madam. Well, perhaps I'd better not say
anything more about that. You write detective books, don't you, madam?
Well, you'll find something in that lady's past, you may be sure of it.
At least, that's what a good many people are saying. And it isn't a nice

So that was what the servants were saying. Miss de Vine, of course; she
was the 'learned lady' whose arrival had coincided with the beginning of
the disturbances--coincided more exactly than Annie could know, unless
she too had seen that drawing in the quad at the Gaudy. A curious woman,
Miss de Vine, and undoubtedly with a varied experience behind those
==> disconcerting eyes. But Harriet was inclined to like her, and she <==
certainly did not look mad in the way that the 'Poison-Pen' was mad;
though it would not be surprising to learn that she had a streak of
fanaticism somewhere. What, by the way, had she been doing the previous
night? She had rooms at the moment in the New Quad; there was probably
little likelihood of proving an alibi for her now. Miss de Vine--well!

report. She pointed out the difficulty of dealing with an outbreak like
that of the previous night single-handed. A careful patrol of the quads
and passages by a number of helpers would probably have resulted in the
capture of the culprit; and the whole of the suspects could in any case
have been checked up at an early moment. She strongly advised enlisting

'I see the point,' replied the Warden; 'but I find that at least two
members of the Senior Common Room feel very strong objection to that
course of action.'

==> 'I know,' said Harriet. 'Miss Allison and Miss Barton. Why?' <==

'I think, too,' pursued the Warden, without answering this question,
'that the matter presents certain difficulties. What would the students
think of these strangers prowling about the college at night? They will
wonder why police duties cannot be undertaken by ourselves, and we can

'I cannot feel it to be very desirable. I know you will say that the
whole situation is undesirable. I quite agree with you.' She looked up.
'I suppose, Miss Vane, you could not yourself spare the time to assist
us?'

==> 'I could spare the time,' said Harriet slowly. 'But without help it is <==
going to be very difficult. If there were only one or two people who
were exonerated without a shadow of doubt, it would be very much
easier.'

'Miss Barton assisted you very ably last night.'

easier.'

'Miss Barton assisted you very ably last night.'

==> 'Yes,' said Harriet; 'but--how shall I put it? If I were writing a story <==
about this, the person first on the spot would be the first to be
suspected.'

The Warden selected an orange skein from her basket and threaded her
needle deliberately.

The Warden selected an orange skein from her basket and threaded her
needle deliberately.

'Will you explain that, please?'

==> Harriet explained carefully. <==

'That is very clearly put,' said Dr. Baring. 'I understand perfectly.
Now, about this student, Miss Hudson. Her explanation does not seem to
be satisfactory. She could not possibly have expected to get food from
the Buttery at that hour; and in fact, she did not.'

==> 'No,' said Harriet; 'but I know quite well that in my day it wasn't too <==
difficult to get round the right side of the Head Scout to leave the
hatch open all night. Then, if one had a late essay or anything and felt
hungry, one went down and got what one wanted.'

'Dear me,' said the Warden.

'Dear me,' said the Warden.

==> 'We were always quite honourable about it,' said Harriet, 'and entered <==
it all on the slate, so that it figured in our battels at the end of
term. Though,' she added thoughtfully, 'there were some items of cold
meat and dripping that must have been camouflaged a bit. Still--I think
Miss Hudson's explanation will pass muster.'

'That is a very generous offer,' said the Warden. 'We shall all be
exceedingly grateful to you.'

==> 'I ought to warn you,' said Harriet, 'that one or two of the Senior <==
Members do not approve of me.'

'That may make it a little more difficult. But if you are ready to put
up with that unpleasantness in the interests of the College, it can only
increase our sense of gratitude. I cannot too strongly emphasise how

it was taken to be a purely personal matter. When the situation
developed, I spoke to Miss Flaxman, and received her assurance that she
and her fiancÃ© would keep the whole thing to themselves until it could
be properly cleared up.'

==> 'I see,' said Harriet. 'Well, we must do what we can. One thing I should <==
like to suggest, and that is some of the passage-lights should be left
on at night. It is difficult enough to patrol a large set of buildings
in the light: in the dark, it is impossible.'

'That is reasonable,' replied Dr. Baring. 'I will speak to the Bursar

'That is reasonable,' replied Dr. Baring. 'I will speak to the Bursar

content.

It was a matter of mild public interest at Shrewsbury College that Miss

of weeks in College, while engaged in research at the Bodleian upon the
life and works of Sheridan Lefanu. The excuse was good enough; Harriet
really was gathering material, in a leisurely way, for a study of
Lefanu, though the Bodleian was not, perhaps, the ideal source for it.

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 109190    window = 109185 109195


errors and obscurities in the cross-references were eliminated; the
rejoinder to Mr. Elkbottom was incorporated in the text and made more
vigorous and conclusive; and the authorities at the Press began to speak
quite hopefully about the date of publication.

==> Whether because Harriet's night prowlings, or perhaps the mere knowledge <==
that the circle of suspects was so greatly narrowed, had intimidated the
Poison-Pen, or for some other reason, there were few outbreaks during
the next few days. One tiresome episode was the complete stopping-up of
the lavatory basin drain in the S.C.R. cloakroom. This was found to be
due to some torn fragments of material, which had been rammed firmly

from the interior of a roll of photographs which Miss Pyke had left for
half an hour in one of the lecture-rooms before using them to illustrate
some remarks about the Parthenon Frieze. Neither of these episodes led
to any discovery.

==> The Senior Common Room behaved to Harriet with that scrupulous and <==
impersonal respect for a person's mission in life which the scholarly
tradition imposes. It was clear to them that, once established as the
official investigator, she must be allowed to investigate without
interference. Nor did they hasten to her with protestations of innocence
or cries of indignation. They treated the situation with a fine

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 109215    window = 109210 109220


or cries of indignation. They treated the situation with a fine
detachment, making little reference to it, and confining the
conversation in Common Room to matters of general and University
interest. In solemn and ritual order, they invited her to consume sherry
or coffee in their rooms, and refrained from comment upon one another.
==> Miss Barton, indeed, went out of her way to invite Harriet's opinions <==
upon _Women in the Modern State_ and to consult her on the subject of
conditions in Germany. It is true that she flatly disagreed with many of
the opinions expressed, but only objectively and without personal
rancour; the vexed subject of the amateur's right to investigate crimes
was decently shelved. Miss Hillyard also, setting aside animosity, took

historical crimes as the murder of Sir Edmund Berry Godfrey and the
alleged poisoning of Sir Thomas Overbury by the Countess of Essex. Such
overtures might, of course, be policy; but Harriet was inclined to
attribute them to a careful instinct for propriety.

With Miss de Vine she had many interesting conversations. The Fellow's
personality attracted and puzzled her very much. More than with any
other of the dons, she felt that with Miss de Vine the devotion to the

that she had told more than she had learnt. She could guess at a history
of conflict; but she found it difficult to believe that Miss de Vine was
unaware of her own repressions or unable to control them.

With a view to establishing friendly relations with the Junior Common
==> Room, Harriet further steeled herself to compose and deliver a 'talk' on <==
'Detection in Fact and Fiction' for a College literary society. This was
perilous work. To the unfortunate case in which she had herself figured
as the suspected party she naturally made no allusion; nor in the
ensuing discussion was anybody so tactless as to mention it. The
Wilvercombe murder was a different matter. There was no obvious reason

with a good deal of taste. She was a tall, elegant girl, obviously
well-to-do, much better dressed than the majority of the students, and
carrying her intellectual attainments easily. She held a minor
scholarship without emoluments, declaring publicly that she was a
scholar only because she would not be seen dead in the ridiculous short
==> gown of a commoner. As alternatives to coffee, she offered Harriet the <==
choice of madeira or a cocktail, politely regretting that the inadequacy
of college arrangements made it impossible to provide ice for the
shaker. Harriet, who disliked cocktails after dinner, and had consumed
madeira and sherry on an almost wearisome number of occasions since her
arrival in Oxford, accepted the coffee, and chuckled as cups and glasses

'Oh, yes,' said Miss Fowler. She was a dark, thick-set Third Year,
dressed in a very grubby sweater which, as she had previously explained,
she had not had time to change, having been afflicted with an essay up
==> to the moment of attending Harriet's talk. 'Yes, I've seen it in dons' <==
rooms. Occasionally. But I've always looked on that as a kind of
infantilism.'

'Isn't it a re-living of the heroic past?' suggested Miss Millbanks. '_O
les beaux jours que ce siÃ¨cle de fer._ And so on.'

'I did enjoy telling people what I thought of them. Too rapturous.
Especially confessing in public the evil, evil thoughts I had had about
that woman Flaxman.'

'Bother Flaxman,' said the dark girl, shortly. Her name was Haydock, and
==> she was, as Harriet presently discovered, considered to be a safe <==
History First. 'She's setting the whole Second Year by the ears. I don't
like her influence at all. And if you ask me, there's something very
wrong with Cattermole. Goodness knows, I don't want any of this business
of being my brother's keeper--we had quite enough of that at school--but
it'll be awkward if Cattermole is driven into doing something drastic.

forbid Flaxman to make people's lives a burden to them. If I could, I
wouldn't. You don't surely expect me to exercise authority? It's bad
enough hounding people to College Meetings. The S.C.R. don't understand
our sad lack of enthusiasm.'

==> 'In their day,' said Harriet, 'I think people had a passion for meetings <==
and organisation.'

'There are plenty of inter-collegiate meetings,' said Miss Layton. 'We
discuss things a great deal, and are indignant about the Proctorial
Rules for Mixed parties. But our enthusiasm for internal affairs is more

'Do you mean about Flaxman's cutting-out expeditions? Or about the
ragging affair? By the way, Miss Vane, I suppose you have heard about
the College Mystery.'

==> 'I've heard something,' replied Harriet, cautiously. 'It seems to be all <==
very tiresome.'

'It will be extremely tiresome if it isn't stopped,' said Miss Haydock.
'I say we ought to do a spot of private investigation ourselves. The
S.C.R. don't seem to be making much progress.'

'There's nothing against Cattermole,' said Miss Fowler, 'except that
somebody wrote Flaxman an offensive letter on the occasion of her
swiping Cattermole's young man. Cattermole was the obvious suspect then,
but why should she do all these other things?'

==> 'Surely,' Miss Layton appealed to Harriet, 'surely the obvious suspect <==
is always innocent.'

Harriet laughed; and Miss Millbanks said:

'Surely,' Miss Layton appealed to Harriet, 'surely the obvious suspect

==> Harriet laughed; and Miss Millbanks said: <==

almost anything to attract attention.'

'Well, I don't believe it's Cattermole,' said Miss Haydock. 'Why should

'There are some oddities in the First Year all right,' said Miss Fowler.
'Why is it that every year seems to get shriller and scrubbier than the
last?'

==> 'They always did,' said Harriet. <==

'Yes,' said Miss Haydock, 'I expect the Third Year said the same about
us when we first came up. But it's a fact that we had none of this
trouble before we had this bunch of freshers in.'

either the S.C.R. or on the unfortunate Cattermole who (as everybody
would remember) was up during the Gaudy, waging simultaneous war against
despised love and Responsions. She did ask, however, whether any
suspicion had fallen upon other students besides Miss Cattermole.

course--she came up from school with a bit of a reputation for ragging,
but in my opinion she's quite sound. I should call the whole of our year
pretty sound. And Cattermole really has only herself to thank. I mean,
she's asking for trouble.'

==> 'How?' asked Harriet. <==

'Various ways,' said Miss Millbanks, with a caution which suggested that
Harriet was too much in the confidence of the S.C.R. to be trusted with
details. 'She is rather inclined to break rules for the sake of
it--which is all right if you get a kick out of it; but she doesn't.'

to make him believe I only did it by looking fragile and pathetic at the

And Miss Layton did, indeed, contrive to look fragile and pathetic, and
anything but learned. Nevertheless, on inquiry from Miss Lydgate,

the English School, and was taking, of all things, a Language Special.
If the dry bones of Philology could be made to live by Miss Layton, then

corner of Burleigh Building, observed something humped and strange about
the outline of the eastern wall, close to where the Principal's private
postern led out into St. Cross Road. It seemed clear that here, in the
words of the old song, was 'a man where nae man should be.'

If she shouted at him, he would drop over on the outer side and be lost.
She had the key of the postern with her--having been trusted with a
complete set of keys for patrol purposes. Pulling her black evening
==> cloak about her face and stepping softly, Harriet ran quickly down the <==
grass path between the Warden's House and the Fellows' Garden, let
herself silently out into St. Cross Road and stood beneath the wall. As
she emerged, a second dark form stepped out from the shadows and said
urgently, 'Oy!'

'And what were you doing on our wall, sir?' demanded Harriet. In the

rounded and, at the moment, disturbed by an expression of mingled
apprehension and amusement. He was a very tall and very large young man;
but Harriet had clasped him in a wiry grip that he could scarcely shake
off without hurting her, and he showed no disposition to use violence.

'Just having a beano,' said the young man promptly. 'A bet, you know,
and all that. Hang my cap on the tiptop branch of the Shrewsbury
beeches. My friend there was the witness. I seem to have lost, don't I?'

'I don't believe it,' said the young man, scanning her face as closely
as he could in the feeble light. 'Not possible. Too young. Too charming.
Too much sense of humour.'

going away quietly. I say, do be a sport. I mean, you're not the Warden
or the Dean or anything. I know them. Couldn't you overlook it?'

thing. It doesn't do. You must see that it doesn't do.'

'Oh, I do see,' agreed the young man. 'Absolutely. Definitely. Dashed

me, will you?' She led him firmly, despite his protests, towards the
postern. 'Oh, I see, yes. A brick or two out of that buttress. Excellent
foothold. You'd almost think they'd been knocked out on purpose,
wouldn't you? And a handy tree in the Fellows' Garden. The Bursar will
have to see to it. Are you well acquainted with that buttress, young

'It's known to exist,' admitted her captive. 'But, look here, we
weren't--we weren't calling on anybody or anything of that kind, you
know, if you know what I mean.'

==> 'I hope not,' said Harriet. <==

'No, we were all on our own,' explained the young man eagerly. 'Nobody
else involved. Good Heavens, no. And, look here, I've bust my ankle and
we shall be gated anyhow, and, dear, kind lady--'

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 109569    window = 109564 109574


we shall be gated anyhow, and, dear, kind lady--'

At this moment, a loud groan resounded from within the College wall. The
young man's face became filled with agonised alarm.

==> 'What's that?' asked Harriet. <==

'I really couldn't say,' said the young man.

The groan was repeated. Harriet grasped the undergraduate tightly by the
arm and led him along to the postern.

'But look here,' said the gentleman, limping dolefully beside her, 'you
mustn't--please don't think--'

==> 'I'm going to see what's the matter,' said Harriet. <==

She unlocked the postern, drew her captive in with her, and relocked the
gate. Under the wall, just beneath the spot where the young man had been
perched, lay a huddled figure, which was apparently suffering acute
internal agonies of some kind.

frightfully sorry about this. I'm afraid we were a bit thoughtless. I
mean, we didn't notice. I mean, I'm afraid she isn't very well, and we
didn't notice how it was, you know.'

==> 'The girl's drunk,' said Harriet, uncompromisingly. <==

She had, in the bad old days, seen too many young poets similarly
afflicted to make any mistake about the symptoms.

'Well. I'm afraid--yes, that's about it,' said the young man. 'Rogers

Lodgings.'

'Hell!' said the young man, for the second time. 'I say--are you going
to be sporting?'

==> 'That depends,' said Harriet. 'As a matter of fact, you've been <==
extraordinarily lucky. I'm not one of the dons. I'm only staying in
College. So I'm a free agent.'

'Bless you!' exclaimed the young man, fervently.

The patient here gave another groan.

'Oh, dear!' said the undergraduate.

==> 'Don't worry,' said Harriet. 'She'll be sick in a minute.' She walked <==
over and inspected the sufferer. 'It's all right. You can preserve a
gentlemanly reticence. I know her. Her name's Cattermole. What's yours?'

'My name's Pomfret--of Queen's.'

'We threw a party round in my friend's rooms,' explained Mr. Pomfret.
'At least, it started as a meeting, but it ended as a party. Nothing
wrong whatever. Miss Cattermole came along for a joke. All clean fun.

Only there were a lot of us, and what with one thing and another we had
a few too many, and then we found Miss Cattermole was rather under the
weather. So we got her collected up, and Rogers and I--'

==> 'Yes, I see,' said Harriet. 'Not very creditable, was it?' <==

'No, it's rotten,' admitted Mr. Pomfret.

'Had she got leave to attend the meeting? And late leave?'

'Gate-crashed you? H'm. That probably means no late leave.'

'Sounds serious,' said Mr. Pomfret.

gating, I suppose; but we have to be more particular. It's a
nasty-minded world, and our rules have to remember that fact.'

'I know,' said Mr. Pomfret. 'As a matter of fact we were dashed worried.
We had a devil of a job getting her along,' he burst out confidentially.

He pulled out his handkerchief and wiped his forehead.

'Anyhow,' he went on, 'I'm thankful you aren't a don.'

==> 'That's all very well,' said Harriet austerely; 'but I'm a Senior Member <==
of College and I must feel responsibility. This isn't the kind of thing
one wants.'

She turned a cold glance on the unfortunate Miss Cattermole, to whom the
worst was happening.

'I'm sure _we_ didn't want it,' said Mr. Pomfret, averting his eyes;
'but what could we do? It's no good trying to corrupt your porter,' he
added ingenuously; 'it's been tried.'

==> 'Indeed?' said Harriet. 'No; you wouldn't get much change out of <==
Padgett. Was anybody else there from Shrewsbury?'

'Yes--Miss Flaxman and Miss Blake. But they had ordinary leave to come
and went off at about eleven. So they're all right.'

'They ought to have taken Miss Cattermole with them.'

got into trouble. Miss Blake's motives were more obscure; but she was
probably only weak-minded. Harriet was fired with a quite unscrupulous
determination that Miss Cattermole should not get into trouble if she
could prevent it. She went across to the limp form and hauled it to its
feet. Miss Cattermole groaned dismally. 'She'll do now,' said Harriet.

He waved a vague hand towards the New Quad at the other end of nowhere.

a hand with her. She's a bit too much for me, and she can't stay here in
the damp. If anybody sees us, you'll have to go through with it. How's

Miss Cattermole was a thickly-built young woman, and no inconsiderable
weight. She had also reached the stage of complete inertia. For Harriet,
hampered by high-heeled shoes, and for Mr. Pomfret, afflicted with a

their feet, and the grunts and shufflings of the limp figure between
them. At every moment, Harriet expected to hear a window thrust up, or

It was with very great relief that she at last found the right doorway
and propelled Miss Cattermole's helpless form through it.

you wandering all over College. Wait a minute. We'll deposit her in the

Mr. Pomfret again bent obligingly to the task.

bathroom floor, took the key from the lock and came out, securing the
door behind her. 'She must stay there for the moment. Now we'll get rid

'Then why do it?'

'I don't know. Why does one do idiotic things?'

stood still to give emphasis to what she was saying. 'I'll tell you why,
Mr. Pomfret. Because you haven't the guts to say No when somebody asks
you to be a sport. That tom-fool word has got more people in trouble
than all the rest of the dictionary put together. If it's sporting to
encourage girls to break rules and drink more than they can carry and

get themselves into a mess on your account, then I'd stop being a sport
and try being a gentleman.'

'Oh, I say,' said Mr. Pomfret, hurt.

'Well, I see your point,' said Mr. Pomfret, shifting his feet uneasily.
'I'll do my best about it. You've been dashed spor--I mean you've
behaved like a perfect gentleman about all this--' He grinned--'and I'll
try to--good Lord! here's somebody coming.'

A quick patter of slippered feet along the passage between the Hall and
Queen Elizabeth was approaching rapidly.

'Get in,' she said.

Mr. Pomfret slipped hastily in behind her. Harriet shut the door on him
and stood quietly in front of it. The footsteps came nearer, came

ladies. So I slipped on my slippers, miss....'

'It's all right, Emily. It was a friend of mine. He came in with me and
wanted very much to see the New Quad by moonlight. So we just walked
across and back again.'

New Quad, so that the scout was bound to follow her. 'It was stupid of
me not to think that it might disturb people. I'll mention it to the
Dean in the morning. You did quite right to come down.'

Emily seemed doubtful. She was one of those people who never feel they

impatiently, thinking of Mr. Pomfret, fuming in the Chapel. At last she
got rid of the scout and turned back.

Complicated, thought Harriet; silly situation, like a farce. Emily

catch each other. Young Pomfret parked in the Chapel. He thinks I'm

perhaps she is--then I couldn't have had Pomfret helping to chase her.

inside, though.'

She looked in through the inner door and was relieved to see a dark
figure faintly outlined against the pale oak of the stalls. Then, with a
sudden, violent shock, she became aware of a second dark figure, poised

She looked in through the inner door and was relieved to see a dark
figure faintly outlined against the pale oak of the stalls. Then, with a
sudden, violent shock, she became aware of a second dark figure, poised
strangely, it seemed, in mid-air.

==> 'Hullo!' said Harriet. In the thin light of the South windows she saw <==
the flash of a white shirt-front as Mr. Pomfret turned. 'It's only me.
_What's that?_'

She took a torch from her handbag and recklessly switched it on. The
beam showed a dismal shape dangling from the canopy above the stalls. It

the flash of a white shirt-front as Mr. Pomfret turned. 'It's only me.
_What's that?_'

She took a torch from her handbag and recklessly switched it on. The
beam showed a dismal shape dangling from the canopy above the stalls. It
==> was swinging a little to and fro and turning slowly as it swung. Harriet <==
darted forward.

'Morbid kind of imagination these girls have got, haven't they--' said
Mr. Pomfret.

darted forward.

'Morbid kind of imagination these girls have got, haven't they--' said
Mr. Pomfret.

==> Harriet contemplated the M.A. cap and gown, arranged over a dress and <==
bolster hitched by a thin cord on one of the terminals with which the
architect had decorated the canopies.

'Bread-knife stuck through the tummy, too,' pursued Mr. Pomfret. 'Gave
me quite a turn, as my aunt would say. Did you catch the young woman?'

'Oh, definitely,' said Mr. Pomfret. 'Thought I'd retreat a bit farther,
you know. So in I came. Then I saw that. So I came along to investigate
and heard somebody scrambling out by the other door--over there.'

He pointed vaguely towards the north side of the building, where a door
==> led into the vestry. Harriet hastened to look. The door was open, and <==
the outer vestry door, though shut, had been unlocked from within. She
peered out. All was quiet.

'Bother them and their rags,' said Harriet, returning. 'No, I didn't
meet the lady. She must have got away while I was taking Emily back to

breath. It was really sickening to have had the Poltergeist under her
hand like that, and to have been distracted by Emily. She went up to the
dummy again, and saw that a paper was pinned to its middle by the

'Quotations from the classics,' said Mr. Pomfret, easily. 'Looks as
though somebody had a grouse against your dons.'

==> 'Silly young fools!' said Harriet: 'Very convincing bit of work, though, <==
come to look at it. If we hadn't found it first, it would have created
quite a sensation when we all filed into prayers. A little investigation
is indicated. Well, now, it's time you went quietly home and were gated
for the good of your soul.'

'Just as you say,' replied Mr. Pomfret. 'And, look here--may I push
round to-morrow--at least, it's this morning, isn't it?--and make
inquiries and all that? Only proper, you know. When shall you be in?
Please!'

==> 'No visitors in the morning,' said Harriet, promptly. 'I don't know what <==
I shall be doing in the afternoon. But you can always ask at the Lodge.'

'Oh, I may? That's top-hole. I'll call--and if you're not there I'll
leave a note. I mean, you must come round and have tea or a cocktail or
something. And I do honestly promise it shan't happen again, if I can

I'll see to it. Good-night.'

'Good-night,' said Mr. Pomfret, 'and thanks frightfully.'

quadrangle, feeling that, out of all this absurd tiresomeness, something
had been most definitely gained. The dummy could scarcely have been put
in position before 9.30; so that Miss Cattermole, through sheer folly,
had contrived to give herself a cast-iron alibi. Harriet was so grateful
to her for advancing the inquiry by even this small step that she

This reminded her that Miss Cattermole still lay on the bathroom floor,
waiting to be dealt with. It would be awkward if she had come to her
senses in the interval and started to make a noise. But on reaching the

bore the name of 'C. I. Briggs,' and knocked gently. The head
reappeared.

'Were you expecting to see Miss Cattermole come in?'

Miss Briggs, who was wearing a woolly coat over her pyjamas, looked a
little alarmed.

'I had some work to do. I was sitting up in any case. Why?'

plain, strong, sensible face. She appeared trustworthy.

Between them they lugged Miss Cattermole up the noisy, polished stairs
and dumped her upon her bed. In grim silence they undressed her and put
her between the sheets.

explanation wouldn't be a bad idea. How about it?'

'Come into my room,' said Miss Briggs. 'Would you like any hot milk or
Ovaltine or coffee, or anything?'

Harriet told her, omitting the names of the gentlemen concerned. But

people go chasing him.'

world to get out of it gracefully. Does the girl really care for him?'

'No,' said Miss Briggs. 'Not really. She just wants somebody or
something. You know. She got a nasty knock when her engagement was
broken. You see, she and Lionel Farringdon had been childhood friends

broken. You see, she and Lionel Farringdon had been childhood friends
and so on, and it was all settled before she came up. Then Farringdon
got collared by our Miss Flaxman, and there was a frightful bust-up. And
there were complications. And Violet Cattermole has gone all unnerved.'

==> 'I know,' said Harriet. 'Sort of desperate feeling--I must have a man of <==
my own--that kind of thing.'

'Yes. Doesn't matter who he is. I think it's a sort of inferiority
complex, or something. One must do idiotic things and assert one's self.
Am I making myself clear?'

affectionate in a firm kind of way. But not Reggie Pomfret, who is a
chivalrous young idiot.'

Miss Briggs poked the fire savagely.

==> 'Well,' said Harriet, 'something has got to be done about all this. I <==
don't want to go to the Dean, but--'

'Of course, something must be done,' said Miss Briggs. 'It's
extraordinarily lucky it should have been you who spotted it and not one
of the dons. I've been almost wishing that _something_ might happen.

[line number in individual story] matching line = 5825    window = 5820 5830

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 110069    window = 110064 110074


I've been frightfully worried about it. It isn't the kind of thing I
know how to cope with at all. But I had to stand by Violet more or
less--otherwise I should simply have lost her confidence altogether and
goodness knows what stupid thing she'd have done then.'

==> 'I think you're quite right,' said Harriet. 'But now, perhaps I can have <==
a word with her and tell her to mind her step. After all, she has got to
give some guarantee of sensible behaviour if I'm not to report her to
the Dean. A spot of benevolent blackmail is indicated, I fancy.'

'Yes,' agreed Miss Briggs. 'You can do it. It's exceedingly decent of

'Yes,' said Miss Briggs, 'but listening to people's confidences does
take such a time, and I'm not awfully good at wrestling with fits of
temperament.'

==> 'The confidante has a very heavy and thankless task,' said Harriet. <==
'It's not surprising if she goes mad in white linen. It's more
surprising if she keeps sane and sensible like you. But I agree that you
ought to have the burden taken off your shoulders. Are you the only
one?'

along and see Miss Cattermole after breakfast. Don't worry too much. I
dare say this upset will be a blessing in disguise. Well, I'll be going
now. Can you lend me a strong knife?'

Miss Briggs, rather astonished, produced a stout pen-knife and said
==> good-night. On her way over to Tudor, Harriet cut down the dangling <==
dummy and carried it away with her for scrutiny and action at a later
hour. She felt she badly needed to sleep on the situation.

She must have been weary, for she dropped off as soon as she was in bed,
and dreamed neither of Peter Wimsey nor of anything else.

'The fact remains,' said Miss Pyke, 'that I have to lecture at nine. Can
anybody lend me a gown?'

A number of the dons were breakfasting in the S.C.R. dining-room.

rather indignant tone.

'Have you lost your gown, Miss Pyke?'

'You could have mine with pleasure, Miss Pyke,' said little Miss

'Ask Miss de Vine or Miss Barton,' said the Dean. 'They have no
lectures. Or Miss Vane--hers would fit you.'

==> 'Certainly,' said Harriet, carelessly. 'Do you want a cap as well?' <==

'The cap _has_ gone as well,' replied Miss Pyke. 'I don't need it for
the lecture; but it would be convenient to know where my property has
gone to.'

herself to scrambled eggs. 'People are very thoughtless. Who, by the
way, owns a black semi-evening crÃªpe-de-chine, figured with bunches of
red and green poppies, with a draped cross-over front, deep hip-yoke and
flared skirt and sleeves about three years out of date?'

'Can't you tell us what the mystery is, Miss Vane?' inquired Miss
Lydgate. 'Or is it better that you shouldn't say anything?'

When I came in last night after my dance I-er went the rounds a bit--'

'Oh,' said Miss Shaw. 'Well, I didn't see it. I knew nothing about it.
It's very odd that nobody should have mentioned it.'

There was a pause; during which everybody had time to think it strange
and improbable that Miss Shaw should not have received the note or heard
of Miss Trotman's departure.

They returned gloomily to the Common Room.

alibi for the whole of that time. Particularly for the time after 11.15.
I suppose I can find out whether any students had late leave till
midnight. Anybody coming in then might have seen something.'

'In the meantime,' said Miss Pyke, pushing away her plate and rolling
her napkin, 'the ordinary duties of the day must be proceeded with.
Could I have my gown--or _a_ gown?'

the crÃªpe-de-chine frock.

'I have never seen that dress to my knowledge before,' said Miss Pyke;

then took out a piece of paper from a drawer. The message upon it was
pasted up in the usual way, and ran

of expressing their feelings in Virgilian hexameters.'

She frowned. Matters were looking rather bad for the Senior Common Room.

about her brow, adding to the general impression of an Angora rabbit
that had gone on the loose and was astonished at the result.

She went out briskly and nearly fell over Mr. Pomfret in the outer
doorway.

makes a noise in the quad and is contrary to regulations.'

'I'm not a visitor,' said Mr. Pomfret, grinning, 'I've been attending
Miss Hillyard's lecture on Constitutional Developments.'

'Quite a man for the ladies, ain't you, sir?' said the man,
disagreeably.

==> At these words, he turned, and, to her amazement, Harriet recognised a <==
familiar face.

'Dear me, Jukes,' said she. 'Fancy seeing you here!'

'Do you know this blighter?' said Mr. Pomfret.

sacked for petty pilfering. I hope you're going straight now, Jukes.
How's your wife?'

'All right,' said Jukes, sulkily. 'I'll come again.'

'All right,' said Jukes, sulkily. 'I'll come again.'

umbrella so awkwardly across it as to bar the way pretty effectively.

'Hi!' said Mr. Pomfret. 'Let's hear about this. Just come back here a
minute, will you?' He stretched out a powerful arm, and yanked the
reluctant Jukes over the threshold.

she will. Nobody's likely to believe you. Why didn't you tell this man
the whole story at once, Mr. Pomfret, and relieve his conscience? By the

==> He gazed at her with dog-like eyes. Harriet laughed, as Mr. Rogers and <==
the tea entered the room together.

Mr. Rogers was in his third year--tall, dark, lively and full of an easy
kind of penitence.

general interest, and, about 5 o'clock, departed, murmuring something in

indelicate necessities. At this point, Mr. Pomfret suddenly went all
solemn as a very young man occasionally does when alone with a woman

the meaning of life. Harriet listened with as much intelligent sympathy
as she could command; but was slightly relieved when three young men

out of the room, took possession of their armchairs and continued the
argument.

'Very able fellow, Marston,' said Mr. Pomfret, amiably enough. 'Great

they contrive to get so worked up about plays. I like a good play, but I
don't understand all this stuff about stylistic treatment and planes of

Anyhow, I know I don't like plays in which all the actors have to keep
on tumbling up and down flights of steps, or where the lighting's so
artistically done that you can't see anything, or where you keep on

'Would you?' said Mr. Pomfret, wistfully. 'You wouldn't come and do a
show with me in Town in the vac, would you?'

Pomfret very much, and they presently found themselves in Mr.
Farringdon's sitting-room, packed like sardines among a mixed crowd of
undergraduates and struggling to consume sherry and biscuits without
moving their elbows.

definite, though the definitions differed. The detective story, no
doubt, was acceptable, because in it something definite was done, the
'what' being comfortably decided beforehand by the author. It was borne

next morning, felt deeply dissatisfied. She did not like this Jukes
business at all. He could scarcely, she supposed, have anything to do
with the anonymous letters: where could he have got hold of that passage
from the Ãneid But he was a man with a grudge, a nasty-minded man, and a

down, 'and naturally she's right to stick by her husband. But one's own
children must come first, mustn't they?'

==> 'Of course,' said Harriet, rather inattentively. 'Oh, yes. I should find <==
somewhere else for them. I suppose you haven't ever heard either Jukes
or his wife say anything to suggest that he--well, that he was stealing
from the College or cherished bad feelings against the dons.'

'Yes, it ought. By the way, Annie, have you ever seen anybody in the
College in a dress of this description?'

her. Annie examined it carefully.

'No, madam, not to my recollection. Perhaps one of the maids that's been

alone knew the exact time for which the alibi was required; and though
many people were able to show themselves covered up to midnight or
thereabouts, all had been, or claimed to have been, virtuously in their
own rooms and beds by a quarter to one. Nor, though the porter's book
and late-leave tickets had been examined, and all students interrogated

It wasn't he, of course. This was a lad of twenty-one or two at the

it--are you any relation of Peter Wimsey's?'

'Why, of course,' said the young man, sitting up on his heels. 'He's my

Oxford version of giving the raspberry.

'Uncle Peter's weakness,' went on Lord Saint-George, carefully
disentangling the squashed meringues from their paper, 'is his strong
sense of public duty. You mightn't think it to look at him, but it's
there. (Shall we try these on the carp? I don't think they're really fit

'I don't know how well you know my uncle,' he proceeded, 'but if you do
get a chance, you might let him know that when you saw me I was looking
rather unwell and hag-ridden and hinted darkly at felo-de-se.'

==> 'I'll make a point of it,' said Harriet. 'I will say you seemed scarcely <==
able to crawl and, in fact, fainted into my arms, accidentally crushing
all my parcels. He won't believe me, but I'll do my best.'

'No--he isn't good at believing things, confound him. I'm afraid I shall

why I should bore you with my personal affairs. Come on down to the
kitchen.'

The Christ Church cook was well pleased to produce meringues from the
==> ancient and famous College oven; and when Harriet had duly admired the <==
vast fireplace with its shining spits and heard statistics of the number
of joints roasted and the quantities of fuel consumed per week in
term-time, she followed her guide out into the quadrangle again with all
proper expressions of gratitude.

'Not at all,' said the Viscount. 'Not much return, I'm afraid, after
banging you all over the place and throwing your property about. May I
know, by the way, whom I have had the honour of inconveniencing?'

==> 'My name's Harriet Vane.' <==

Lord Saint-George stood still, and smote himself heavily over the
forehead.

'My God, what have I done? Miss Vane, I do beg your pardon--and throw

'My God, what have I done? Miss Vane, I do beg your pardon--and throw
myself abjectly on your mercy. If my uncle hears about this he'll never
forgive me, and I _shall_ cut my throat. It is borne in upon me that I
have said every possible thing I should not.'

==> 'It's my fault,' said Harriet, seeing that he looked really alarmed, 'I <==
ought to have warned you.'

'As a matter of fact, I've no business to say things like that to
anybody. I'm afraid I've inherited my uncle's tongue and my mother's

'I suppose so. By the way--hell! I seem to be putting my foot in it all
round, but I ought to explain that I've never heard him talk about you.

Annie the tip. It's a pity she couldn't have removed the children
earlier.'

'I gather from Annie,' said the Bursar, 'that they rather think they can

'Terrible,' said Miss Lydgate. 'I can't imagine anything more dreadful
to an honest person's feelings.'

Term was drawing to a close, and the investigation seemed little farther

perambulationus and the frustration of the Library and Chapel scandals
had exercised a restraining influence on the Poltergeist, for there was
no further outbreak of any kind, not so much as an inscription in a
lavatory or an anonymous letter, for three days. The Dean, exceedingly
busy, was relieved by the respite, and also cheered by the news that

lavatory or an anonymous letter, for three days. The Dean, exceedingly
busy, was relieved by the respite, and also cheered by the news that
Mrs. Goodwin the secretary would be back on the Monday to cope with the
end-of-term rush. Miss Cattermole was seen to be more cheerful, and
wrote a quite respectable paper for Miss Hillyard about the naval policy
==> of Henry VIII. Harriet asked the enigmatic Miss de Vine to coffee. As <==
usual, she had intended to lay bare Miss de Vine's soul, and, as usual,
found herself laying bare her own.

before their private lives, it causes less outcry than when a woman does
the same thing, because women put up with neglect better than men,
having been brought up to expect it.'

'But suppose one doesn't quite know which one wants to put first.
==> Suppose,' said Harriet, falling back on words which were not her own, <==
'suppose one is cursed with both a heart and a brain?'

'You can usually tell,' said Miss de Vine, 'by seeing what kind of
mistakes you make. I'm quite sure that one never makes _fundamental_
mistakes about the thing one really wants to do. Fundamental mistakes

'You can usually tell,' said Miss de Vine, 'by seeing what kind of
mistakes you make. I'm quite sure that one never makes _fundamental_
mistakes about the thing one really wants to do. Fundamental mistakes
arise out of lack of genuine interest. In my opinion, that is.'

==> 'I made a very big mistake once,' said Harriet, 'as I expect you know. I <==
don't think that arose out of lack of interest. It seemed at the time
the most important thing in the world.'

'And yet you made the mistake. Were you really giving all your mind to
it, do you think? Your _mind_? Were you really being as cautious and

'Well, that's what I mean. You expend the trouble and you don't make any
mistake--and _then_ you experience the ecstasy. But if there's any
subject in which you're content with the second-rate, then it isn't
really your subject.'

==> 'You're dead right,' said Harriet after a pause. 'If one's genuinely <==
interested one knows how to be patient, and let time pass, as Queen
Elizabeth said. Perhaps that's the meaning of the phrase about genius
being eternal patience, which I always thought rather absurd. If you
truly want a thing, you don't snatch; if you snatch, you don't really
want it. Do you suppose that, if you find yourself taking pains about a

comes right, without those fundamental errors. One always makes surface
errors, of course. But a fundamental error is a sure sign of not caring.
I wish one could teach people nowadays that the doctrine of snatching
what one thinks one wants is unsound.'

==> 'I saw six plays this winter in London,' said Harriet, 'all preaching <==
the doctrine of snatch. I agree that they left me with the feeling that
none of the characters knew what they wanted.'

'No,' said Miss de Vine. 'If you are once sure what you do want, you
find that everything else goes down before it like grass under a

she couldn't, of course. If she actually saw Mr. Elkbottom writhing in
humiliation she'd be sorry, but she wouldn't alter a paragraph. That
would be treason. One can't be pitiful where one's own job is concerned.
You'd lie cheerfully, I expect, about anything except--what?'

==> 'Oh, anything!' said Harriet, laughing. 'Except saying that somebody's <==
beastly book is good when it isn't. I can't do that. It makes me a lot
of enemies, but I can't do it.'

'No, one can't,' said Miss de Vine. 'However painful it is, there's
always one thing one has to deal with sincerely, if there's any root to

commit all the sins in the calendar, and still be faithful and honest
towards one person. If so, then that one person is probably one's
appointed job. I'm not despising that kind of loyalty; it doesn't happen
to be mine, that is all.'

==> 'Did you discover that by making a fundamental mistake?' asked Harriet, <==
a little nervously.

'Yes,' said Miss de Vine. 'I once got engaged to somebody. But I found I
was always blundering--hurting his feelings, doing stupid things, making
quite elementary mistakes about him. In the end I realised that I simply

'Probably not; though there are a few rare people, I believe, who don't
look on themselves as jobs but as fellow-creatures.'

'I should think PhÅbe Tucker and her husband were like that,' said
==> Harriet. 'You met her at the Gaudy. That collaboration seems to work. <==
But what with the wives who are jealous of their husbands' work and the
husbands who are jealous of their wives' interests, it looks as though
most of us imagined ourselves to be jobs.'

naÃ¯ve invitation, if you think I can't see through that, you're mightily
mistaken. This is not for me, but for _les beaux yeux de la cassette de
l'oncle Pierre_. But there are worse meals than those that come out of
the House kitchen, and I will go. I should like to know how much money
you're managing to get through, by the way. The heir of Denver should be

Still in this severe mood, she drove down St. Aldate's on Monday and
inquired of the porter beneath Tom Tower for Lord Saint-George; only to
be told that Lord Saint-George was not in College.

==> 'Oh!' said Harriet, disconcerted, 'but he asked me to lunch.' <==

'What a pity you weren't let know, miss. Lord Saint-George was in a
nasty motor-accident on Friday night. He's in the Infirmary. Didn't you
see it in the papers?'

said the porter, with regret, and yet, with a slight relish at the
imparting of bad news. 'He was unconscious for twenty-four hours; but we
are informed that his condition is now improving. The Duke and Duchess
have left for the country again.'

==> 'Dear me!' said Harriet. 'I'm sorry to hear this. I'd better go round <==
and inquire. Do you know whether he is allowed to see anybody yet?'

The porter looked her over with a paternal eye, which somehow suggested
to her that if she had been an undergraduate the answer would have been
No.

The Niersteiner was excellent, and Harriet heartlessly enjoyed her

'Do,' said Mr. Danvers. 'What's that?' he added turning to the porter,
who had come out with a letter in his hand. 'Oh, something for
Saint-George. Right. Yes. I expect the lady will take it up, if she's
going now. If not, it can wait for the messenger.'

resented most in Peter; the condescending superiority, the arrogance of
caste and the generosity that was like a blow in the face. However:--

it was, he seemed inclined to stop and think. And he had, what she
herself lacked, the grace of gratitude. His facile acceptance of favours

disappointed to find that it had an air of officious impertinence. She
tore it up.

The students were making a vast noise of trampling and laughter in the

your nephew, who has unfortunately--'

parties, like the one in the Annexe; others lent their aid to people
who, like herself, were engaged in the elusive pursuit of knowledge,
covering paper with ink and hesitating now and again over a word. She

upon the main door. That was locked also. She stepped back and shouted

porters were vouched for by their respective wives, and had, in fact,

had occurred while they were at their posts; the Infirmarian and the
Infirmary maid had also been together the whole time. Miss Hudson, the
student who had been considered a 'possible,' had been at a coffee-party

great relief, had been in Queen Elizabeth, enjoying the hospitality of a
party of Third Years; she had just risen to say good night, remarking
that it was past her usual time, when the lights had gone out. She had
then been caught up in the throng and, as soon as she could free
herself, had run hastily up to her own room to rescue her proofs.

a heavy bruise on the side of the face where, so she said, she had been

seconds together by a pair of students. She had then run to look for the

Miss Chilperic's story was equally difficult of proof. When the cry of
'There she goes!' had been raised at Tudor, she had been among the first
to run out, but, having no torch, and being too much excited to notice

undergraduates.

It had only been after Padgett had sat for about five minutes in vain at

themselves, they should have been. But to collect them all into one
lighted room and keep them there was not so easy. She established Miss
Lydgate in her own room and went to look for the rest, asking them to go

public scandal is the thing aimed at, I imagine. But if another episode
should occur, it will narrow the field.'

'Yes; most of the S.C.R. will be away. Next term, what with the Warden,

Town seemed remarkably empty and uninteresting. Yet a lot of things were
==> going on. Harriet saw her agent and publisher, signed a contract for <==
serial rights, heard the inner history of the quarrel between Lord
Gobbersleigh the newspaper proprietor and Mr. Adrian Cloot the reviewer,
entered warmly into the triangular dispute raging among Gargantua
Colour-Talkies Ltd., Mr. Garrick Drury the actor and Mrs.
Snell-Wilmington author of _Passion-flower Pie_, and into the details of

Ring. Enter secretary with telegram (this was probably it). Wordy and
unnecessary cable from American magazine representative to say she was

Vane about a story for their publication. Cordially. What on earth did
these people want to talk about? You did not write stories by talking
about them.

Ring. Second post. Letter with Italian stamp. (Slight delay in sorting,
no doubt.) Oh, thank you, Miss Bracey. Imbecile, writing very bad
English, was eager to translate Miss Vane's works into Italian. Could
Miss Vane inform the writer of what books she had composed? Translators
==> were all like that--no English, no sense, no backing. Harriet said <==
briefly what she thought of them, told Miss Bracey to refer the matter
to the agent and returned to her dictation.

'Wilfrid stared at the handkerchief. What was it doing there in
Winchester's bedroom? With a curious feeling of ...'

that's right. Good-bye ... Some club wanting a debate on 'Should Genius
Marry?' The question's not likely to concern any of their members
personally, so why do they bother?... Yes, Miss Bracey? Oh, yes,
Wilfrid. Bother Wilfrid! I'm taking quite a dislike to the man.'

==> By tea-time, Wilfrid was behaving so tiresomely that Harriet put him <==
away in a rage and sallied out to attend a literary cocktail party. The
room in which it was held was exceedingly hot and crowded, and all the
assembled authors were discussing (_a_) publishers (_b_) agents, (_c_)
their own sales (_d_) other people's sales, and (_e_) the extraordinary
behaviour of the Book at the Moment selectors in awarding their

assembled authors were discussing (_a_) publishers (_b_) agents, (_c_)
their own sales (_d_) other people's sales, and (_e_) the extraordinary
behaviour of the Book at the Moment selectors in awarding their
ephemeral crown to Tasker Hepplewater's _Mock Turtle_. 'I finished this
book,' one distinguished adjudicator had said, 'with tears running down
==> my face.' The author of _Serpent's Fang_ confided to Harriet over a <==
_petite saucisse_ and a glass of sherry that they must have been tears
of pure boredom; but the author of _Dust and Shiver_ said, No--they were
probably tears of merriment, called forth by the unintentional humour of
the book; had she ever met Hepplewater? A very angry young woman, whose
book had been passed over, declared that the whole thing was a notorious

thought that in this instance it was political, because there was some
powerful anti-Fascist propaganda in _Mock Turtle_ and it was well known
that you could always get old Sneep Fortescue with a good smack at the
Blackshirts.

==> 'But what's _Mock Turtle_ about?' inquired Harriet. <==

On this point the authors were for the most part vague; but a young man
who wrote humorous magazines stories, and could therefore afford to be
wide-minded about novels, said he had read it and thought it rather
interesting, only a bit long. It was about a swimming instructor at a

round in their encasing shells. But of course a lot of things came into
it--it was one of those books that reflect the author's reactions to
Things in General. Altogether, significant was, he thought, the word to
describe it.

==> Harriet began to feel that there might be something to be said even for <==
the plot of _Death 'twixt Wind and Water_. It was, at least, significant
of nothing in particular.

Harriet went back, irritated to Mecklenburg Square. As she entered the
house, she could hear her telephone ringing apoplectically on the first

And now I've got to dine with this dashed undergraduate, and be made to
feel the burden of incalculable age.'

To her surprise, however, she enjoyed both the dinner and the show.
There was a refreshing lack of complication about Reggie Pomfret. He

or his own; he did not use words with double meanings; he did not
challenge you to attack him and then suddenly roll himself into an
armadillo-like ball, presenting a smooth, defensive surface of ironical
quotations; he had no overtones of any kind; he was a good-natured, not
very clever, young man, eager to give pleasure to some one who had shown
==> him a kindness. Harriet found him quite extraordinarily restful. <==

'Will you come up for a moment and have a drink or anything?' said
Harriet, on her own doorstep.

'Thanks awfully,' said Mr. Pomfret, 'if it isn't too late.'

what's in it. What will you have? Will you help yourself?'

Mr. Pomfret surveyed such refreshments as offered themselves and asked
what he might mix for her. The drink question being settled, there was a
pause.

'Well, you were fairly firm with me. But I agree with Miss Cattermole.
Absolutely, I mean, we agree about having a great admiration for you.'

'Yes, really. Rather. I'll never forget the way you tackled that fellow
Jukes. Did you see he got himself into trouble only a week or so later?'

'Yes. I'm not surprised.'

behave politely to him. She exerted herself to talk with bright interest

    I send in my demand notes with the brutal regularity of the

    that, some time or other, one _has_ to take notice of the

==> After reading that letter, Harriet knew that she could not rest till it <==
was answered. The bitter unhappiness of its opening paragraphs was
readily explained by the last two. He probably thought--he could not
possibly help thinking--that she had known him all these years, only to
confide in the end, not in him, but in a boy less than half his age and
his own nephew, whom she had known only a couple of weeks and had little

little finger-tip to little finger-tip, smiling, irresistible. Forty
minutes later, he took his leave, still smiling, having ceded, without
noticing it, rather more than he had gained, and told in ten words more
than he had learned in a thousand.

==> But of this interlude Harriet naturally knew nothing. On the evening of <==
the same day, she was dining alone, a little depressed, at Romano's. She
had nearly finished, when she saw a man, just leaving the restaurant,
who was sketching a vague gesture of recognition. He was in the forties,
going a little bald, with a smooth, vacant face and a dark moustache.
For a moment she could not place him; then something about his languid

afternoon that was, too. Can't think why harmless women should be
dragged along to be bored while a lot of little boys play off their Old
School Ties. (That's meant for a joke.) You were frightfully
well-behaved, I remember.'

==> Harriet said sedately that she always enjoyed a good cricket match. <==

'Do you? I thought it was politeness. It's pretty slow work, if you ask
me. But I was never any good at it myself. It's all right for old Peter.
He can always work himself into a stew thinking how much better he'd

mild old gentlemen do sometimes break out into a spot of tut-tuttery.
How about a brandy? Waiter, two liqueur brandies. Are you writing any
more books?'

Suppressing the rage that this question always rouses in a professional
==> writer, Harriet admitted that she was. <==

'It must be splendid to be able to write,' said Mr. Arbuthnot. 'I often
think I could spin a good yarn myself if I had the brains. About the odd
things that happen, you know. Queer deals, and that kind of thing.'

two men. Mr. Arbuthnot, moron as he might be in other respects, had a
flair for money. He knew what that mysterious commodity was going to do;
it was the one thing he did know, and he only knew that by instinct.
When things were preparing to go up or down, they rang a little warning

He got up, a little abruptly, and said good night.

Ten days before the beginning of term, Harriet could bear London no
longer. The final touch was put to her disgust by the sight of an

the twisting race at King's Mill by Mesopotamia to Parson's Pleasure;
then back, with mind relaxed and body stretched and vigorous, to make
toast by the fire; and then, at night, the lit lamp and the drawn
curtain, with the flutter of the turned page and soft scrape of pen on
paper the only sounds to break the utter silence between quarter and

poison-pen and looked it over; yet, viewed by that solitary lamp, even
the ugly, printed scrawls looked harmless and impersonal, and the whole
dismal problem less important than the determining of a first edition
date or the settlement of a disputed reading.

party coming up: two small, flaxen-haired girls in charge of a woman
whose face seemed at first vaguely familiar. Then, as they came close,
she realised that it was Annie, looking strange without her cap and
apron, taking the children for a walk.

now.

'We've found a very nice place in Headington, madam, thank you. I'm

anyone with his way to make and so much competition.'

It would be better to get off the subject of the husband's wrongs and

That's a boy's job.'

'But they ought not, madam. It isn't fair. The boys have hard enough
work to get jobs of their own. Please don't put such things into her

And then the dons began to arrive, full of their vacation activities and
ready to take up the burden of the most exacting, yet most lovable term

those cheerful and determined faces concealed a secret. Miss de Vine had
been consulting a library in some ancient Flemish town, where was
preserved a remarkable family correspondence dealing with trade
conditions between England and Flanders under Elizabeth. Her mind was
full of statistics about wool and pepper, and it was difficult to get

Term. She had undoubtedly burnt some old papers--there might have been
newspapers among them--certainly she never read the _Daily Trumpet_--she
could throw no light on the mutilated newspaper found in the fireplace.

most interesting long week-end with Professor Somebody, who was a great
authority upon Greek quantitative measures; and he had discovered
several passages that contained inaccuracies and thrown an entirely

have deliberately chosen not to marry. And, if you will forgive my

At this ominous phrase, always the prelude to something quite

was crossing St. Giles on her way back, shortly before midnight, when
she was aware of a group of young men in evening dress, standing about
one of the trees which adorn that famous thoroughfare. Being naturally

another youth, who had evidently been occupying an observation-post,

hastily, and the group promptly scattered in all directions--some
running past her, some making their way down side-streets, and a few
bold spirits fleeing towards the small enclosure known as the Fender,
within which (since it belongs not to the Town but to St. John's) they
could play at tig with the Proctor to their hearts' content. One of the

'But you _have_ been avoiding me,' said Mr. Pomfret. 'I know you have. I
suppose it's ridiculous to expect you to take any particular interest in
me. I don't suppose you ever think about me. You probably despise me.'

'What _about_? Hang it, don't be so unkind. Look here, Harriet--No,

the Lamb and Flag, found herself listening to as eager an avowal of
devotion as any young gentleman in his twenties ever lavished upon a
lady considerably his senior in age and experience.

'I'm frightfully sorry, Mr. Pomfret. I never thought--No, really, it's

quite impossible. I'm at least ten years older than you are. And
besides--'

'What does that matter?' With a large and clumsy gesture Mr. Pomfret
swept away the difference of age and plunged on in a flood of eloquence,
==> which Harriet, exasperated with herself and him, could not stop. He <==
loved her, he adored her, he was intensely miserable, he could neither
work nor play games for thinking of her, if she refused him he didn't
know what he should do with himself, she must have seen, she must have
realised--he wanted to stand between her and all the world--

Mr Pomfret was six feet three and broad and strong in proportion.

saying 'Drop it, CÃ¦sar,' to somebody else's large and disobedient
Alsatian. 'No, I mean it. I can't let you--' And then in a different
tone:

'Look out, juggins! Here's the Proctor.'

'The Proctor would like to speak to you, sir,' said the Bulldog, grimly.

==> Harriet debated with herself whether it might not be more tactful to <==
depart, leaving Mr. Pomfret to his fate. But the Proctor was close on
the heels of his men; he was standing within a few yards of her and
already demanding to know the offender's name and college. There seemed
to be nothing for it but to face the matter out.

Pomfret's sake, to control a rebellious uprush of laughter. 'This
gentleman is with me, and you can't--Oh! good evening, Mr. Jenkyn.'

It was, indeed, that amiable pro-Proctor. He gazed at Harriet, and was
struck dumb with embarrassment.

'can you now?'

'Come to think of it,' replied Mr. Jenkyn, 'I suppose I can't. You're a
Senior Member, aren't you?' He waved his bulldogs to a distance. 'I beg
your pardon,' he added, a little stiffly.

hunting in St. Giles?'

'Two culprits will appear before their dean to-morrow,' said the
pro-Proctor, rather more cheerfully. 'I suppose nobody came through
here?'

A wicked facility in quotation tempted her to add 'except in the
Hesperides'; but she respected Mr. Pomfret's feelings and restrained
herself.

'No, no,' said Mr. Jenkyn. He fingered his bands nervously and hitched
his gown with its velvet facings protectively about his shoulders. 'I
had better be away in pursuit of those that have.'

==> 'Good night,' said Harriet. <==

'Good night,' said Mr. Jenkyn, courteously raising his square cap. He
turned sharply upon Mr. Pomfret. 'Good night, sir.'

He stalked away with brisk steps between the posts into Museum Road, his

Pomfret there occurred one of those silences into which the first word
spoken falls like the stroke of a gong. It seemed equally impossible to
comment on the interruption or to resume the interrupted conversation.
By common consent, however, they turned their backs upon the pro-Proctor
and moved out once more into St. Giles. They had turned left and were

passing through the now-deserted Fender before Mr. Pomfret found his
tongue.

'A nice fool I look,' said Mr. Pomfret, bitterly.

==> 'It was very unfortunate,' said Harriet, 'but I must have looked much <==
the more foolish. I very nearly ran away altogether. However, all's well
that ends well. He's a very decent sort and I don't suppose he'll think
twice about it.'

She remembered, with another disconcerting interior gurgle of mirth, an

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 114312    window = 114307 114317


the most crashing social bricks make but a small ripple in the ocean of
time, which quickly dies away. To Mr. Pomfret, however, the ripple must
inevitably appear of the dimensions of a maelstrom. He was muttering
sulkily something about a laughing-stock.

==> 'Please,' said Harriet, 'don't worry about it. It's of no importance. I <==
don't mind one bit.'

'Of course not,' said Mr. Pomfret. 'Naturally, you can't take me
seriously. You're treating me like a child.'

'Indeed I'm not. I'm very grateful--I'm very much honoured by everything
you said to me. But really and truly, it's quite impossible.'

'Oh, well, never mind,' said Mr. Pomfret, angrily.

==> It was too bad, thought Harriet. To have one's young affections trampled <==
upon was galling enough; to have been made an object of official
ridicule as well was almost unbearable. She must do something to restore
the young gentleman's self-respect.

'Listen, Mr. Pomfret. I don't think I shall ever marry anybody. Please

making a scene in front of the Proggins--in fact, for existing. I'm
exceedingly sorry.'

Very clearly, the only balm that could in the least soothe the wounded
vanity of Mr. Pomfret would be the assurance that there was somebody
==> else. But Harriet was not prepared to make any such admission; and <==
besides, whether there _was_ anybody else or not, nothing could make the
notion of marrying Mr. Pomfret anything but preposterous. She begged him
to take a reasonable view of the matter; but he continued to sulk; and
indeed, nothing that could possibly be said could mitigate the essential
absurdity of the situation. To offer a lady one's chivalrous protection

'Good night.'

Mr. Pomfret ran hurriedly in the direction of Queen's College pursued by
a yelping chorus of chimes.

==> Harriet went on down Holywell. She could laugh now if she wanted to; and <==
she did laugh. She had no fear of any permanent damage to Mr. Pomfret's
heart; he was far too cross to be suffering in anything but his vanity.
The incident had that rich savour of the ludicrous which neither pity
nor charity can destroy. Unfortunately, she could not in decency share
it with anybody; she could only enjoy it in lonely ecstasies of mirth.

unworthiness, few of us are really offended by hearing the assertion

In this unregenerate mood she reached the College, and let herself in by
the postern. There were lights in the Warden's Lodgings, and somebody

footsteps, this person called out, in the Dean's voice:

'Is that you, Miss Vane. The Warden wants to see you.'

'What's the matter, Dean?'

'We don't know what to think. It's not like Newland to be out without
leave. And we've found things.'

her desk, her handsome face stern and judicial. In front of her stood
Miss Haydock, with her hands thrust into her dressing-gown pockets; she
looked excited and angry. Miss Shaw, curled dismally in a corner of the
big couch, was crying; while Miss Millbanks the Senior Student,
half-frightened and half-defiant, hovered uneasily in the background. As

the time; but I didn't recognise her as one of our students. As a matter
of fact, I don't remember ever noticing her at all, until she was
pointed out to me yesterday by Miss Martin.'

'I thought she looked on me as a friend,' complained Miss Shaw.

'When Miss Martin spoke to Miss Millbanks about her,' said Miss Haydock,
cutting in without respect of persons upon the Warden's reply, 'Miss

could be expected to do anything.'

'Padgett also said he had seen several of the anonymous letters arrive
at the Lodge for Miss Newland.'

She took a little sheaf of papers from her desk and handed them to

The Poison-Pen, this time, had found a victim ready made to her hand.
There were the letters, thirty or more of them ('and I don't suppose

insinuating--all hammering remorselessly upon the same theme. 'You

comment that the boat-house keys should have been checked the moment
Miss Newland's absence had been remarked. 'Miss Haydock--did Miss
Newland say anything to you--anything at all--while you were out, that
might suggest where she was likely to go in case she wanted to drown
herself?'

anything more, and I'd forgotten it till this moment.'

'Half-past nine, she was last seen. She'd have to get to the boat-house.
Had she a bicycle? No? Then it would take her nearly half an hour. Ten.
Say another forty minutes to the Rollers, unless she was very quick--'

'Of course she might. But there's just the chance. People get an idea
and stick to it. And they don't always make their minds up instantly.'

'If I know anything of the girl's psychology,' began Miss Shaw.

and we've got to risk a guess. Who'll come with me? I'll get the car--we
shall go quicker by road than by river. We can commandeer a boat
somewhere above the Parks--if we have to break open a boat-house.

down towards a dismal shape, black and slimy on the black water. The
boat lurched as the man leaned out. In the silence came the answering
groan, splash, chuck of oars on the far side of the next bend.

'All right,' said the policeman. 'Only a bit o' sacking.'

The sculls struck the water again.

'Is that the Bursar's boat coming up?' said the Dean.

Just as she spoke, someone in the other boat gave a shout. There was a
heavy splash and a cry ahead, and an answering shout from the constable:

'There she goes!'

bring their nose round the bend, she saw, across stroke's shoulder in
the beam of the torch, the thing they had come to find--the shining keel
of a canoe adrift in mid-stream, with the paddles floating beside it;

towards the left bank.

The boat rocked perilously as they heaved and tore at the clinging
weeds, razor-sharp and strong as grave-bands. The Water-fly had come up

keep her sculls out of mischief. The boats edged together. The girl's
head was out of the water, dead-white and lifeless, disfigured with
black slime and dark stripes of weed. The constable was supporting the
body. Miss Haydock had both hands in the stream, slashing with a knife
at the ribbon-weed that was wrapped viciously about the legs. The other

at the ribbon-weed that was wrapped viciously about the legs. The other
boat, hampered by its own lightness, was heeling over to stroke with
gunwales awash, as her passengers reached and grappled.

==> 'Trim your boat, damn you!' said Harriet, not pleased at the idea of <==
having two fresh corpses to see to, and forgetting in her wrath to whom
she was speaking. Miss Stevens paid no attention; but Miss Edwards threw
her weight over; and as the boat lifted the body lifted too. Harriet,
keeping her torch steady so that the rescuers could see what they were
doing, watched the reluctant weeds loose their last coils and slip back.

'Yes; but if anybody else has anything better to suggest--'

Nobody had any very helpful suggestion. The discussion went on. In the

Miss Pyke came down her staircase and passed them without a word. Still

It struck her then as a fantastic idea that she should fly for help to

==> Between the married (or about-to-be-married) and the unmarried, Harriet <==
felt herself to be like Ãsop's bat between the birds and beasts; an odd
result, she felt, of having sown her wild oats in public. Lunch was a
strained meal. She came into Hall rather late, to find that the High
Table had sorted itself out into opposing camps, with Miss Hillyard at
one end and Mrs. Goodwin at the other. She found an empty chair between

'Telephoning from Rome?' said Miss Allison, in piercing accents. 'Oh,
one of your correspondents, I suppose. He must be better off than most
historians.'

==> 'I think it's for me,' said Harriet, and turned to the scout. 'Are you <==
sure they said de Vine and not Vane?'

The scout was not very sure.

'If you're expecting it, it must be for you,' said Miss de Vine. Miss

The scout was not very sure.

'If you're expecting it, it must be for you,' said Miss de Vine. Miss
Allison made some rather sharp observation about writers of

uncomfortably and angry with herself for doing so.

As she went down to the public call-box in Queen Elizabeth, to which the
call had been put through, she tried to arrange in her own mind what to
say. A brief sentence of apology; another brief sentence of explanation

week-end, when there were no posts. If she wrote now to London and they
replied by return, she would still, in all probability, be able to take
no action till Monday. If she wrote to Peter, there might be an
Air-Mail--but suppose he wasn't at Warsaw after all. He might by now
have gone on to Bucharest or Berlin. Could she possibly ring up the

Fellow of a distinguished college and a member of the Council by which
Shrewsbury was governed. Friends and benefactors of this kind were not
infrequently entertained in College, and as a rule the High Table was
glad of their presence. But the moment was scarcely auspicious. However,
the engagement had been made early in the term, and it was quite
==> impossible to put Dr. Threep off. Harriet said she thought this visit <==
might be a good thing, and help to keep the minds of the S.C.R. off
their troubles.

'We'll hope so,' said the Dean. 'He's a very nice man, and talks very
interestingly. He's a political economist.'

'Hard-boiled or soft-boiled?'

'Hard, I think.'

This question had no reference to Dr. Threep's politics or economics,
==> but only to his shirt-front. Harriet and the Dean had begun to collect <==
shirt-fronts. Miss Chilperic's 'young man' had started the collection.
He was extremely tall and thin and rather hollow-chested; by way of
emphasising this latter defect, he always wore a soft pleated
dress-shirt, which made him look (according to the Dean) like the
scooped-out rind of a melon. By way of contrast, there had been an

never-to-be-forgotten happy day a popular poet had arrived to give a
lecture on his methods of composition and the future of poetry, whereby,
at every gesticulation (and he had used a great many) his waistcoat had
leapt in the air, allowing a line of shirt, adorned with a little tab,
to peep out, rabbit-like, over the waist-line of the confining trouser.
==> On this occasion, Harriet and the Dean had disgraced themselves badly. <==

Dr. Threep was a large, agreeable, talkative person, who at first sight
appeared to present no loophole for sartorial criticism. But he had not
been seated at table three minutes before Harriet realised that he was
doomed to form one of the most notable additions to the collection. For

louder than usual that night, so that the poppings were inaudible beyond
a few places to right and left of him; but the Warden and the Dean, who
==> sat beside him, heard them, and Harriet, sitting opposite, heard them; <==
she dared not catch the Dean's eye. Dr. Threep was too well-bred, or
perhaps too much embarrassed, to allude to the matter; he talked on
imperturbably, raising his voice more and more to be heard above the din
of the undergraduates. The Warden was frowning.

half the night, a prey to imaginary alarms. When at length she had gone
to bed, she had had the tiresome dream about trying to catch a train,
hampered all the time by a quantity of luggage which she strove vainly
to pack in misty and unmanageable suit-cases. In the morning, she
struggled desperately with the proofs of Miss Lydgate's chapter on

And so forth and so on--all along the towing path, all the way up the
long avenue to the Meadow Buildings and all the way round Christ Church,
from Hall to Kitchen, from Cathedral to Library, from Mercury to Great
Tom, while all the time the sky brooded lower and the weather became

her skull were stuffed with wool, ended up with a raging headache.

The storm held off till after Hall, except for threatenings and

then the swish and rush of falling water, the gurgle of overflowing
gutters, and peace.

'I'll tell you what we'll do,' said the Dean, brightly. 'We'll toddle
along like two good little people and hear the University Sermon. I
can't think of anything more soothingly normal and academic than that.
And Dr. Armstrong's preaching. He's always interesting.'

thing I should have thought of for myself. But it's an idea; definitely
an idea. We'll go.'

The blessing was given; the voluntary rolled out--something fugal and

fixed on the softly-tinted saints in the rood-screen. At length they
both rose and made their way to the door. A mild, clear gust of wind met

==> Harriet smiled to herself as she went to change for the river. If Peter <==
was keen on keeping up decayed traditions he would find plenty of
opportunity by keeping to a pre-War standard of watermanship, manners
and dress. Especially dress. A pair of grubby shorts or a faded
regulation suit rolled negligently about the waist was the modern
version of Cherwell fashions for men; for women, a sun-bathing costume

regulation suit rolled negligently about the waist was the modern
version of Cherwell fashions for men; for women, a sun-bathing costume
with (for the tender-footed) a pair of gaily-coloured beach sandals.
==> Harriet shook her head at the sunshine, which was now hot as well as <==
bright. Even for the sake of startling Peter, she was not prepared to
offer a display of grilled back and mosquito-bitten legs. She would go
seemly and comfortable.

The Dean, meeting her under the beeches, gazed with exaggerated surprise

The Dean groaned gently. 'I'm afraid you are making yourself
conspicuous. That kind of thing is not done. You are clothed, clean and
cool. On a Sunday afternoon, too. I am ashamed of you. I hope, at least,
the parcel under your arm contains the records of crooners.'

==> 'Not even that,' said Harriet. <==

Actually, it contained her diary of the Shrewsbury scandal. She had
thought that the best thing would be to let Peter take it away and study
it for himself. Then he could decide what was best to be done about it.

She was punctual at the bridge, but found Peter there before her. His
obsolete politeness in this respect was emphasised by the presence of
Miss Flaxman and another Shrewsburian, who were sitting on the raft,
apparently waiting for their escort, and looking rather hot and
==> irritable. It amused Harriet to let Wimsey take charge of her parcel, <==
hand her ceremoniously into the punt and arrange the cushions for her,
and to know, by his ironical eyes, that he perfectly well understood the
reason of her unusual meekness.

'Is it your pleasure to go up or down?'

the perfect English aristocrat!" but some of them said, "Does he need
that glass in his eye or is it just part of the costoom?"'

==> Harriet laughed, thinking of Miss Schuster-Slatt. <==

'My dear--' said Mrs. Peake, who seemed to have a kindly nature.

'The country cousins,' said Mr. Peake remorselessly, 'invariably became
speechless and had to be revived with coffee and ices at Buol's.'

don't even know enough to apologise. Think it's dashed funny. Stupid
oafs. And gramophones bawling in your ears. And look at 'em! Just look
at 'em! Enough to make you sick. Like the monkey-house at the Zoo!'

==> 'Noble and nude and antique!' suggested Harriet. <==

'I don't mean that. I mean the pole-climbing. Watch that girl--hand over
hand, up she goes! And turning round to shove as if she was trying to
clear a drain. She'll be in if she isn't careful.'

The river was wider here, and by way of answer he bent his knees to the
stroke, making the punt curtsey and the water run chuckling under the
bows.

'Not for the world.'

'Nor I. Not for anything you could give me. Perhaps that's an

==> 'What makes you so sure of that?' said Harriet, suddenly reminded of Mr. <==
Pomfret and the pro-Proctor.

me that all young men in their twenties are not fools?' He stood,

'He is only in his Second Year.'

'Then he has time to get over it. I should like to meet him. He is
probably the best friend I have in the world.'

==> Harriet said nothing. Peter's intelligence could always make rings round <==
her own more slowly-moving wits. It was quite true that the spontaneous
affections of Reggie Pomfret had, somehow, made it easier to believe
that Peter's own feelings might be something more than an artist's
tenderness for his own achievement. But it was indecent of Peter to
reach that conclusion so rapidly. She resented the way in which he

'What's the matter?'

'I've struck something horrible. Can't you smell it? It's scandalous the

'My dear idiot, it's only the corporation garbage dump.'

His eyes followed her pointing hand to the farther bank, where a cloud
of flies circled about a horrid mound of putrefaction.

They had put in under the dappled shade of an overhanging willow a
little down the left bank of the Isis. Here there was less crowd, and
what there was could pass at a distance. Here, if anywhere, they might
hope for comparative peace. It was, therefore, with more than ordinary
==> irritation that Harriet, with the thermos yet in her hand, observed a <==
heavily-laden punt approaching.

'Miss Schuster-Slatt and her party. Oh, God! and she says she knows
you.'

The poles were firmly driven in at either end of the boat; escape was
impossible. Ineluctably the American contingent advanced upon them. They
were alongside. Miss Schuster-Slatt was crying out excitedly. It was
==> Harriet's turn to blush for her friends. With incredible coyness Miss <==
Schuster-Slatt apologised for her intrusion, effected introductions, was
sure they were terribly in the way, reminded Lord Peter of their former

At which point the much-tried Wimsey lay down among the tea-cups and
became hysterical.

unconquerable sweetness of disposition is very shaming. I lose my temper
with that harmless woman. Have some more tea.'

'I think,' said his lordship, mournfully, 'I had better stop being the

Fate seems to be turning my one-day romance into a roaring farce. If
that is the dossier, let me have it. We'll see,' he added with a faint
chuckle, 'what kind of a detective you make when you're left to

==> Harriet handed him the loose-leaf book and an envelope containing the <==
various anonymous documents, all endorsed, where possible, with the date
and manner of publication. He examined the documents first, separately
and carefully, without manifesting surprise, disgust, or, indeed, any
emotion beyond meditative interest. He then put them all back in the
envelope, filled and lit a pipe, curled himself up among the cushions

'I'll say one thing for the writing of detective fiction: you know how
to put your story together; how to arrange the evidence.'

indeed.'

He read on.

His next observation was:

dipped in boiling water. Through the confusion of her darkened eyes and
drumming ears some enormous bulk seemed to stoop over her. Then the mist
cleared. His eyes were riveted upon the manuscript again, but he
breathed as though he had been running.

==> So, thought Harriet, it has happened. But it happened long ago. The only <==
new thing that has happened is that now I have got to admit it to
myself. I have known it for some time. But does he know it? He has very
little excuse, after this, for not knowing it. Apparently he refuses to
see it, and that may be new. If so, it ought to be easier to do what I
meant to do.

conscious of his every movement, of every page he turned, of every
breath he drew. She seemed to be separately conscious of every bone in
his body. At length he spoke, and she wondered how she could ever have
mistaken another man's voice for his.

==> 'Well, Harriet, it's not a pretty problem.' <==

'It's not. And it simply mustn't go on, Peter. We can't have any more
people frightened into the river. Publicity or no publicity, it's got to
be stopped. Otherwise, even if nobody else gets hurt, we shall all go

shooting contemptuously past him in a pair-oar skiff; then three punts
side by side, in which everybody seemed to be asleep except those
actually responsible for pole and paddle. One of these passed within a

lay with his knees cocked up, his mouth slightly open and his face
flushed with the heat; a girl sprawled against his shoulder, while the

with the thumbs beneath his braces, had also given up all interest in
the outer world. The fourth passenger, a woman, was eating chocolates.

heart and pull up the poles. She put off decision from moment to moment,
till a loud shriek and a bump at her end of the punt came to spare her
the trouble. The incompetent novice had returned with her crew and,
having left her pole in the middle of the river, had let her craft

towards Iffley.

They parted at the postern.

As she got into bed she recalled the extempore prayer of a well-meaning

less, and began to hunt for her slippers. 'If somebody's playing another

break the glass.'

'Don't cut yourself.'

==> How many times, thought Harriet, had her detective Robert Templeton <==
broken through doors to discover the dead body of the murdered
financier! With a ludicrous feeling that she was acting a part, she laid
a fold of her dressing-gown across the panel and delivered a sharp blow
upon it with her closed fist. Rather to her astonishment, the panel
broke inwards exactly as it should have done, to the accompaniment of a

modest tinkle of glass. Now--a scarf or handkerchief wrapped round to
protect the hand and wrist, and prevent leaving extra finger-prints on
the key and handle. The Dean obligingly fetched this needful accessory;
and the door was opened.

==> Harriet's first glance by torch-light was for the switch. It stood in <==
the 'Off position, and she struck it down with the handle of the torch.
The room stood revealed.

It was a rather bare, uncomfortable place, furnished with a couple of
long tables, a quantity of hard chairs and a blackboard. It was called

fluttered to the floor, showing that the Pen had been interrupted in the
middle of her work.

'So here's where she does it!' cried the Dean.

==> 'Yes,' said Harriet. 'I wonder why. It seems unnecessarily public. Why <==
not her own room?... I say, Dean--don't pick that up, if you don't mind.
Better leave everything as it is.'

The door in the dark-room was open. Harriet went in and examined the
sink, and the open window above it. Marks in the dust showed clearly

'Yes,' said Harriet. 'I wonder why. It seems unnecessarily public. Why

Better leave everything as it is.'

==> The door in the dark-room was open. Harriet went in and examined the <==
sink, and the open window above it. Marks in the dust showed clearly
where something had scrambled over the sill.

'What's underneath this window outside?'

'No; and it happens to be a spot that's overlooked by absolutely nothing

the person should have been seen getting out. If the letters _had_ to be
concocted in a lecture-room, this is as good a place as any. Well! I

sharply on the two scouts. 'You say you saw the person, Annie.'

'Not exactly saw her, madam, not to recognise. She had on something
black and was sitting at the far table with her back to the door. I
thought she was writing.'

as you can and work round to the switch and turn it off? Is the curtain
much as it was, Annie, or did I disarrange it when I broke the glass?'

'I think it's much the same, madam.'

==> The Dean went in and sat down. Harriet shut the door and put her eye to <==
the chink in the curtain. This was at the hinge-side of the door, and
gave her a sight of the window, the ends of the two tables and the place
where the blackboard had stood beneath the window.

'Have a look, Annie; was it like that?'

The light went out.

'How did that go off?' asked the Dean, cautiously, with her mouth at the
hole in the panel.

==> 'First-rate performance,' said Harriet. 'Dead on time.' <==

'The second I heard the knock. I just nipped away to the right and crept
round the wall. Did you hear me?'

'Not a sound. You've got soft slippers on, haven't you?'

the lights on in the lecture-room and we came to see if it was all
right.'

The student vanished, with a jerk of a tousled head that showed what she
thought of the matter. The two servants went their way. The Dean turned
==> to Harriet. <==

'Why all that business of reconstructing the crime?'

'I want to find out whether Annie could really have seen what she said
she saw. These people sometimes let their imagination run away with

you can't be young here." So then he said, very nicely, "I beg your
pardon for behaving like a mountebank; I have no excuse to offer, so
will you forgive me?" So I asked him to dinner.'

==> Harriet shook her head. <==

'I'm afraid you're susceptible to fair hair and a slim figure. That in
the slender's but a humorous word which in the stout is flat
impertinence.'

Dean's room and told them the story, with some assistance from Miss
Martin, who asked whether he would like to interview the two scouts.

'Not for the moment. You seem to have asked all the necessary questions.

that already. She climbed over the sink and knocked that beaker off the

sill. It's dried up now, of course.'

'Yes; but that proves she really did get out this way and at that time.
Though it scarcely needed proving. There _is_ no other way out. This

'Oh, quite a number, nowadays,' said the Dean. 'Little buns in the neck
have come back. I use them myself, but mine are bronze ones. And some of
the students. And Miss Lydgate--but I think hers are bronze, too.'

==> 'I know who uses black ones this shape,' said Harriet. 'I once had the <==
pleasure of sticking them in for her.'

'Miss de Vine, of course. Always the White Queen. And she _would_ drop
them all over the place. But I should think she was about the only
person in College who would never, by any chance, come into this room.

She gives no lectures or classes and never uses the dark-room or
consults scientific works.'

'She was working in her room when I came across last night,' said

'Did you see her?' said Wimsey, quickly.

'I'm sorry. I'm an idiot. I only meant that her reading-lamp was on,
close to her window.'

Wimsey. 'I'm afraid I shall have to do the floor-walk after all.'

It was the Dean who picked up a second hairpin--in the place where one
might most reasonably expect to find it--in a corner near the sink in
the dark-room. She was so pleased with herself as a detective that she
==> almost forgot the implications of the discovery, till Harriet's <==
distressed exclamation forced them upon her.

'We haven't identified the hairpins for certain,' said Peter,
comfortingly. 'That will be a little task for Miss Vane.' He gathered up
the papers. 'I'll take these and add them to the dossier. I suppose

He picked up the board, which contained only a few chemical formulÃ¦,
scribbled in chalk, in Miss Edwards's handwriting, and restored the
easel to an upright position, on the far side of the window.

==> 'Look!' said Harriet, suddenly. 'I know why she went round that way. She <==
meant to get out by the lecture-room window, and had forgotten the bars.
It was only when she pulled the curtain aside and saw them that she
remembered the dark-room and plunged away in a hurry, knocking over the
blackboard and tumbling into the chairs on the way. She must have been
between the window and the easel, because the board _and_ the easel fell

'Then she must have got out while Carrie was fetching you out of bed. I
suppose nobody saw her go.'

'I've asked the only three students whose windows overlook that wall,
==> and they saw nothing,' said Harriet. <==

'Well, you might ask Annie about the beaker. And ask both of them
whether they noticed, as they came past, if the dark-room window was
open or shut, I don't suppose they noticed anything, but you never can
tell.'

dealing with a short-sighted or a long-sighted person--mentally, I mean.
And you might inquire at the same time whether any of the other women in
the Scouts' Wing saw the light in the lecture-room, and if so, how
early.'

==> Harriet laughed. <==

'I can tell you that at once. None of them. If they had, there would
have been an eager rush to tell us all about it. You may be perfectly
certain that Annie's and Carrie's adventure formed the staple of
conversation in the servants' hall this morning.'

conversation in the servants' hall this morning.'

'That,' said his lordship, 'is very true indeed.'

There was a pause. The lecture-room seemed to offer no further field for

College.

'I was about to suggest it,' said he, 'if you can spare the time.'

'Miss Lydgate is expecting me in half an hour for a fresh attack on the

'I was about to suggest it,' said he, 'if you can spare the time.'

'Miss Lydgate is expecting me in half an hour for a fresh attack on the

precious, poor dear, and she's suddenly thought of a new appendix.'

'Oh, _no_!' cried the Dean.

'Alas, yes! But we could just go round and view the more important

Barton's former room, the lay-out of the Chapel with reference to the
postern and the place where, with the help of God, one leaps over the
wall, and the way from Queen Elizabeth into the New Quad.'

==> 'Great Heavens!' said Harriet. 'Did you sit up all night with the <==
dossier?'

'Hush! no, I woke rather early. But don't let Bunter hear, or he will
start being solicitous. Men have died and the worms have eaten them, but
not for early rising. In fact, it is said that it's the early worm that

waiting in my room to get the bird this minute. Three late-without
leaves, two gramophones-out-of-doors, and an irregular motor-vehicle. We
shall meet again at dinner, Lord Peter.'

She ran briskly away to deal with the malefactors, leaving Peter and
==> Harriet to make their tour. From Peter's comments, Harriet could make <==
out little of his mind; she fancied, indeed, that he was somewhat
abstracted from the matter in hand.

'I fancy,' he said at last, as they came to the Jowett Walk Lodge, where
he had left the car, 'that you will have very little more trouble at

idea that from now on you and at least one other person may be in some
danger of attack. That may be imagination. But if this joker is alarmed
and bottled up for a bit--and I think she has been alarmed--the next
outrage may be a serious one--when it comes.'

==> 'Well,' said Harriet, 'we have her word for it that she finds me merely <==
funny.'

His attention seemed to be attracted by something among the dash-board
fittings, and he said, looking not at her but at the car:

'Are you serious?'

Miss Barton's story about the strong hands that had seized her from
behind. It might have been quite true. The thought of perambulating the
long corridors by night was suddenly disagreeable.

'Very well; I'll be careful.'

They were standing at the door of the Senior Common Room, which
conveniently overlooked the Jowett Walk Lodge. The Old Quad was
animated. Late-comers were hurrying over to change for dinner; others,
having changed, were strolling about in groups, waiting for the bell;
some were still playing tennis; Miss de Vine emerged from the Library

evening than was usual before 7 o'clock. She thought they all seemed
apprehensive and some even hostile. They tended to avoid one another's

It may, perhaps, be embarrassing for a solitary man to walk across a
wide quadrangle under a fire of glances from a collection of collegiate

trek from the pavilion at Lord's to the far end of the pitch, with five
wickets down and ninety needed to save the follow-on. Thousands of
people then alive might have recognised that easy and unhurried stride

'Have you cleaned your teeth and said your prayers?'

'Yes, mamma; and cut my nails and washed behind the ears and got a clean

Looking at a bunch of students who happened to pass at the moment,
==> Harriet wished she could have said the same of them. They were grubby <==
and dishevelled and she felt unexpectedly obliged to Miss Shaw for
having made an effort in the matter of dress. As for her convoy, from
his sleek yellow head to his pumps she distrusted him; his mood of the
morning was gone, and he was ready for mischief as a wilderness of
monkeys.

before. That colour is very becoming to you.'

His tone was pleasantly detached and she hoped he was referring to her
dress; but she was not sure. She was glad to relinquish him to the Dean,
who came forward to claim him and to relieve her of the introductions.
==> Harriet watched in some amusement. Miss Lydgate, far too unselfconscious <==
to have any attitude at all, greeted him exactly as she would have
greeted anybody else, and asked eagerly about the situation in Central
Europe; Miss Shaw smiled with a graciousness that emphasised Miss
Stevens's brusque 'How-d'ye-do' and immediate retreat into animated
discussion of college affairs with Miss Allison; Miss Pyke pounced on

advancing with an evident determination to put him right about capital
punishment, was disarmed by the blank amiability of the countenance
offered for her inspection and observed instead that it had been a
remarkably fine day.

==> 'Comedian!' thought Harriet, as Miss Barton, finding she could make <==
nothing of him, passed him on to Miss Hillyard.

'Ah!' said Wimsey instantly, smiling into the History Tutor's sulky
eyes, 'this is delightful. Your paper in the _Historical Review_ on the

appropriation of monastic funds, but she had little doubt that the back
of his mind was full of hairpins.

'All right; I'll go and prattle to him. You'd better sit opposite to us

==> By this arrangement, Harriet found herself placed a little uncomfortably <==
between Miss Hillyard (in whom she always felt an antagonism to herself)
and Miss Barton (who was obviously still worried about Wimsey's
detective hobbies), and face to face with the two people whose glances
were most likely to disturb her gravity. On the other side of the Dean
sat Miss Pyke; on the other side of Miss Hillyard was Miss de Vine, well

were most likely to disturb her gravity. On the other side of the Dean
sat Miss Pyke; on the other side of Miss Hillyard was Miss de Vine, well
under Wimsey's eye. Miss Lydgate, that secure fortress, was situated at
the far end of the table, offering no kind of refuge.

==> Neither Miss Hillyard nor Miss Barton had much to say to Harriet, who <==
was thus able to follow, without too much difficulty, the Warden's
straightforward determination to size up Wimsey and Wimsey's
diplomatically veiled but equally obstinate determination to size up the
Warden; a contest carried on with unwavering courtesy on either side.

'And I had hoped I was returning to civilisation.'

The removal of fish-plates caused a slight diversion, and the Warden
took the opportunity to turn her inquiries upon the situation in Europe.
==> Here the guest was on his own ground. Harriet caught the Dean's eye and <==
smiled. But the more formidable challenge was coming. International
politics led to history, and history--in Dr. Baring's mind--to
philosophy. The ominous name of Plato suddenly emerged from a tangle of
words, and Dr. Baring moved out a philosophical speculation, like a
pawn, and planted it temptingly _en prise_.

'There is a question on which I am anxious to be instructed,' said Miss
Pyke, 'if you will not take it amiss.'

Miss Pyke, of course, was still worried about Dr. Threep's shirt-front,
==> and determined on getting enlightenment. Harriet hoped that Wimsey would <==
recognise her curiosity for what it was: not skittishness, but the
embarrassing appetite for exact information which characterises the
scholarly mind.

'That phenomenon,' he said, readily, 'comes within my own sphere of

'The inconvenience,' added Wimsey, 'was even greater in the case of
plate armour, which had to be very well tailored to allow of movement at
all.'

==> At this point, Miss Barton captured Harriet's attention with some remark <==
or other, and she lost track of the conversation on the other side of
the table. When she picked up the threads again, Miss Pyke was giving
her neighbours some curious details about Ancient Minoan civilisation,
and the Warden was apparently waiting till she had finished to pounce on
Peter again. Turning to her right, Harriet saw that Miss Hillyard was

he peeled an apple, the narrow coils of the rind sliding slowly over his
fingers. She concluded with some question; and he shook his head.

'It is very unlikely. I should say there was no hope of it at all.'

==> Harriet wondered whether the subject of the Poison-Pen had risen at last <==
to the surface; but presently he said:

'Three hundred years ago it mattered comparatively little. But now that
you have the age of national self-realisation, the age of colonial
expansion, the age of the barbarian invasions and the age of the decline

having accomplished nothing but an epic.'

She collected the High Table with her eye, rose, and made a stately
exit. Peter effaced himself politely against the panelling while the
dons filed past him, arriving at the edge of the dais in time to pick up
==> Miss Shaw's scarf as it slipped from her shoulders. Harriet found <==
herself descending the staircase between Miss Martin and Miss de Vine,
who remarked:

'You are a courageous woman.'

herself descending the staircase between Miss Martin and Miss de Vine,
who remarked:

'You are a courageous woman.'

==> 'Why?' said Harriet lightly. 'To bring my friends here and have them put <==
to the question?'

'Nonsense,' interrupted the Dean. 'We all behaved beautifully. Daniel is
still uneaten--in fact; at one point he bit the lion. Was that genuine,
by the way?'

'About tone-deafness? Probably just a little more genuine than he made
out.'

'Will he lay traps all evening for us to walk into?'

==> Harriet realised for a moment how queer the whole situation was. Once <==
again, she felt Wimsey as a dangerous alien and herself on the side of
the women who, with so strange a generosity, were welcoming the
inquisitor among them. She said, however:

'If he does, he will display all the mechanism in the most obliging

[line number in individual story] matching line = 13904    window = 13899 13909

he has any.'

She detached herself from the other two, and went on into the Senior
Common Room with a sombre face.

==> 'Curious,' said Harriet. 'She is saying about Peter Wimsey exactly what <==
I have always thought about herself.'

'Perhaps she recognises a kindred spirit.'

'Or a foe worthy of--I ought not to say that.'

Here Peter and his companion caught them up, and the Dean, joining Miss

interrogative smile.

'What's worrying you.'

'Peter--I feel exactly like Judas.'

She released his arm and went into the room ahead of him, feeling
suddenly embarrassed and looking, in consequence, defiant. The coffee
was already on the table, and the S.C.R. were gathered about it, helping
themselves. She saw Miss Barton advance upon Peter, with a courteous
offer of refreshment on her lips but the light of determination in her
==> eye. Harriet did not for the moment care what happened to Peter. He had <==
given her a new bone to worry. She provided herself with coffee and a
cigarette, and retired with them and the bone into a corner. She had
often wondered, in a detached kind of way, what it was that Peter valued
in her and had apparently valued from that first day when she had stood
in the dock and spoken for her own life. Now that she knew, she thought

'But do you really feel comfortable about it, Lord Peter?'

'No--I shouldn't recommend it as a comfortable occupation. But is your
or my or anybody's comfort of very great importance?'

==> Miss Barton probably took that for flippancy; Harriet recognised the <==
ruthless voice that had said, 'What does it matter if it hurts ...' Let
them fight it out ... Unattractive; but if he meant what he said, it
explained a great many things. Those were qualities that could be
recognised under the most sordid conditions.... 'Detachment ... if you
ever find a person who likes you because of it, that liking is sincere.'

speaking. Miss Lydgate, with a troubled face, was listening to an
anecdote that Mrs. Goodwin was telling about her little boy; in the
middle of it, Miss Hillyard, who was within earshot, rose pointedly,
stabbed out her cigarette on a distant ash-tray, and moved slowly, and
as though despite herself, to a window-seat close to where Miss Barton
==> was still standing. Harriet could see her angry, smouldering glance fix <==
itself on Peter's bent head and then jerk away across the quad, only to
return again. Miss Edwards, close to Harriet and a little in front of
her on a low chair, had her hands set squarely and rather mannishly on
her knees, and was leaning forward; she had the air of waiting for
something. Miss Pyke, on her feet, lighting a cigarette, was apparently

as the slaughter of the innocents. If you are out for my blood, won't
you allow me to hand you a more serviceable weapon?'

He glanced round and, finding that everybody but Miss Pyke and
themselves was sitting down silent, made a brief, interrogative pause,
==> which looked like politeness, but which Harriet mentally classed as <==
'good theatre.'

Miss Pyke led the way to a large sofa near Miss Hillyard's window-seat
and said, as she settled herself in the corner of it:

'Thank you. I thought you were going to say, to my inquisitiveness.'

'I might have done so,' said Miss Barton, frankly. 'But you lay claim to
a principle, so we'll stick to that.'

==> 'Who were the other three people attacked?' asked Harriet. (She had no <==
fancy to let Miss Barton get away with it too easily.)

'A lawyer, a colleague of mine and myself. But that doesn't prove that I
have any principles. I'm quite capable of getting killed for the fun of
the thing. Who isn't?'

Galileo, the Church--'

'You'll never get any scientist to agree there,' broke in Miss Edwards.
'To suppress a fact is to publish a falsehood.'

==> For a few minutes Harriet lost the thread of the discussion, which now <==
became general. That it had been deliberately pushed to this point, she
could see; but what Peter wanted to make of it, she had no idea. Yet he
was obviously interested. His eyes, under their half-closed lids, were
alert. He was like a cat waiting at a mouse-hole. Or was she
half-consciously connecting him with his own blazon? 'Sable: three mice

'But supposing it had come to something?' demanded Miss Barton, pinning
the _argumentum ad hominem_ with a kind of relish.

'Oh, well--What does the ideal detective do then, Miss Vane?'

==> 'Professional etiquette,' said Harriet, 'would suggest an extorted <==
confession, followed by poison for two in the library.'

'You see how easy it is, when you stick to the rules,' said Wimsey.
'Miss Vane feels no compunction. She wipes me out with a firm hand,
rather than damage my reputation. But the question isn't always so

painting. 'A bad picture by a good painter is a betrayal of truth--his
own truth.'

'That's only a relative kind of truth,' objected Miss Edwards.

==> The Dean and Miss Burrows fell headlong upon this remark, and Harriet, <==
seeing the argument in danger of getting out of hand, thought it time to
retrieve the ball and send it back. She knew now what was wanted, though
not why it was wanted.

'If you can't agree about painters, make it someone else. Make it a

'Not for Solomon and all his wives and concubines? I congratulate you,
Miss Barton, on striking such a fine, unfeminine note. Will nobody say a
word for the women and children?'

==> ('I knew he was going to be mischievous,' thought Harriet.) <==

'You'd like to hear it, wouldn't you?' said Miss Hillyard.

'You've got us in a cleft stick,' said the Dean. 'If we say it, you can
point out that womanlinesss unfits us for learning; and if we don't, you

'Perhaps he had some idea of rediscovering it some-day,' said Miss de
Vine, 'and setting himself right with his conscience. I don't know, and
I don't think he knew very well himself.'

==> 'What happened to him?' asked Harriet. <==

'Well, that was the end of him, of course. He lost the professorship,
naturally, and they took away his M.A. degree as well. A pity, because
he was brilliant in his own way--and very good-looking, if that has
anything to do with it.'

'Well,' said Miss Chilperic, 'oughtn't the women and children to have a
point of view? I mean--suppose the wife knew that her husband had done a
thing like that for her, what would she feel about it?'

==> 'That's a very important point,' said Harriet. 'You'd think she'd feel <==
too ghastly for words.'

'It depends,' said the Dean. 'I don't believe nine women out of ten
would care a dash.'

Miss Chilperic looked so much alarmed at the idea of fostering social
revolution that only the opportune entry of two Common-Room scouts to
remove the coffee-cups and relieve her of the necessity of replying
seemed to have saved her from sinking through the floor.

==> 'Well,' said Harriet, 'I agree absolutely with Miss Chilperic. If <==
anybody did a dishonourable thing and then said he did it for one's own
sake, it would be the last insult. How could one ever feel the same to
him again?'

'Indeed,' said Miss Pyke, 'it must surely vitiate the whole

'Of course they would,' said Miss Hillyard. 'That's what the man wants.
_He_ wouldn't say thank you for a critic on the hearth.'

==> 'He must have the womanly woman, you think?' said Harriet. 'What is it, <==
Annie? My coffee-cup? Here you are ... Somebody who will say, "The
greater the sin the greater the sacrifice--and consequently the greater
devotion." Poor Miss Schuster-Slatt!... I suppose it is comforting to be
told that one is loved whatever one does.'

shut behind the last of the coffee-service. 'Here we sit round in a
ring, dissociating ourselves from kind Mrs. Bones and that sweet girl,

'While I,' said Peter, 'sit desolate in the midst, like a lodge in a
garden of cucumbers.'

There was a laugh, and a momentary silence. Harriet could feel a nervous

hospitality of the Senior Common Room, and graciously inviting his
lordship to call upon her in her own house at any convenient time during
his stay in Oxford. Various dons rose up and drifted away, murmuring
that they had essays to look through before they went to bed. The talk
had ranged pleasantly over a variety of topics. Peter had let the reins

The clocks struck eleven. Wimsey roused himself and said he thought he
had better be getting along. Everybody rose. The Old Quad was dark,
except for the gleam of lighted windows; the sky had clouded, and a

The Dean, too, was gone.

come and fetch it.'

'I brought yours back with me and left it at the Jowett Walk Lodge. Also
your dossier. I expect they've been taken up.'

'You can come up.'

There were a number of students scurrying about the corridors in
undress, who looked at Peter with more curiosity than annoyance. In

the dossier. Peter picked up the book, examined the paper and string and
the seals which secured them, each one stamped with the crouching cat
and arrogant Wimsey motto.

'If that's been opened, I'll make a meal of hot sealing-wax.'

He showed no further curiosity, but took the gown she handed to him and
followed her downstairs again.

They were half-way across the quad when he said suddenly:

'I think I do. I hope so. Why?'

'If you don't, I am the most blazing fool in Christendom. I am busily
engaged in sawing off my own branch. If I am honest, I shall probably

His voice was curiously rough, as though he were trying to control
something; not, she thought, bodily pain or passion, but something more
fundamental.

==> 'If you are not,' said Harriet, 'then _I_ shall lose _you_, because you <==
wouldn't be the same person, would you?'

'I don't know. I have a reputation for flippant insincerity. You think
I'm honest?'

She gave it to him, and he held it for a moment in a firm clasp, and
then drew her arm through his. They moved on into the New Quad, arm in
arm, in silence. As they passed the archway at the foot of the Hall

the faint glimmer of a watching face; but it was gone before she could
draw Peter's attention to it.

Padgett unlocked the gate for them; Wimsey, stepping preoccupied over
the threshold, tossed him a heedless good night.

surprise you--'

The stream of reminiscence ran remorselessly on, till Wimsey, suddenly
==> reminded of his manners, apologised to Harriet and plunged hastily out, <==
with a promise to return for another chat over old times, Padgett, still
beaming, swung the heavy gate to, and locked it.

'Ah!' said Padgett, 'he ain't changed much, the major 'asn't. He was a
lot younger then, o' course--only just gazetted--but he was a regular

'Yes, miss. We was in rest at the time, and next morning, when the
sergeant-major falls us in for parade--coo, lummy! we was a pair o'
family portraits. The sergeant-major--Sergeant-Major Toop, that was, 'im

Ain't much 'e don't know." Arter that, 'Uggins kep' 'is epithets to

==> Harriet expressed due appreciation of this anecdote, which was delivered <==
with a great deal of gusto, and took leave of Padgett. For some reason,
this affair of a mop and a bucket seemed to have made Padgett Peter's
slave for life. Men were very odd.

There was nobody under the Hall arches as she returned, but as she

This is an ash-blond in a House blazer.'

'Oh, dear me!' said Miss Pyke. 'Apollo Belvedere in spotless flannels.
He appears to be unattached. Remarkable.'

'Perhaps he belongs to that bunch playing tennis,' hazarded Miss
Allison.

'Why all the excitement, anyway?' asked Miss Hillyard.

'Beautiful young men are always exciting,' said the Dean.

==> 'That,' said Harriet, at length getting a glimpse of the wonder-youth <==
over Miss Pyke's shoulder, 'is Viscount Saint-George.'

'Another of your aristocratic friends?' asked Miss Barton.

'His nephew,' replied Harriet; not very coherently.

escaping from their belts. Growing tired of this, he sauntered past the
windows towards Queen Elizabeth, his eye roving over a group of
Shrewsburians a-sprawl under the beeches, like that of a young Sultan
inspecting a rather unpromising consignment of Circassian slaves.

==> 'Supercilious little beast!' thought Harriet; and wondered if he was <==
looking for her. If he was, he could wait, or ask properly at the Lodge.

'Oho!' said the Dean. 'So _that's_ how the milk got into the coconut!'

From the door of the Library Wing there issued slowly Miss de Vine, and

'Talking of uncles,' said the Dean, 'is it true, Miss Hillyard, that
Richard III--I thought she was here.'

'Helen is being returned to us,' said the Dean. 'The siege of Troy is
postponed.'

The trio were returning again up the path. Half-way along Miss de Vine

'If you're suggesting--' began Miss Barton.

'I'm only suggesting,' said the Dean, 'that it's a bit of a clichÃ©.'

made some remark, to which the Fellow replied briefly, but with a smile.

'Insinuating men, these Wimseys,' said the Dean. 'Vamping the S.C.R.
right and left.'

==> Harriet laughed, but in Saint-George's quick, appraising glance at Miss <==
Barton she had again seen his uncle look for a moment out of his eyes.
These family resemblances were unnerving. She curled herself into the
window-seat and watched for nearly ten minutes, The viscount sat still,
smoking a cigarette, and looking entirely at his ease. Miss Lydgate,
Miss Burrows and Miss Shaw came in and began to pour out tea. The

smoking a cigarette, and looking entirely at his ease. Miss Lydgate,
Miss Burrows and Miss Shaw came in and began to pour out tea. The
tennis-party finished the set and moved away. Then, from the left, came
a quick, light step along the gravel walk.

Lord Saint-George greeted Harriet enthusiastically.

'It's not a bad sport,' said Peter, 'You might take it up till you can

extremely angry with him. However, to show annoyance was to play into

porter's classic rebuke:

Tudor, rather red in the face.

'Please, I am to apologise.'

this in my own quad. Frankly, I can't afford it.'

'I'm most frightfully sorry,' said Lord Saint-George. 'It was rotten of
me. Honestly, I wasn't thinking of anything except getting Uncle Peter's

'It's a pity he can't find some other way to do it. I seem to be a
perfect mill-stone tied round your neck, and the sooner I clear out the
better.'

be morbid about it, it certainly would be better for _you_ if you _did_
clear out. I've told you so before.'

Lord Saint-George, finding his elders dilatory, blew a cheerful
'hi-tiddley-hi-ti, pom, pom' on the horn.

his nephew angrily out of the driving-seat, jerked the door of the
Daimler to noisily and shot off up the road with a bellowing roar.
==> Harriet, finding herself unexpectedly possessed of a magnificent fit of <==
bad temper, went back, determined to extract the last ounce of enjoyment
out of it; an exercise in which she was greatly helped by the discovery
that the little episode on the loggia had greatly intrigued the Senior
Common Room, and by learning from Miss Allison, after Hall, that Miss
Hillyard, when she heard of it, had made some very unpleasant

Hillyard, when she heard of it, had made some very unpleasant
observations, which it was only right that Miss Vane should know about.

                 *        *        *        *        *

thousands of other people, except have the rotten luck to be tried for
my life and have the whole miserable business dragged out into
daylight?... Anybody would think I'd been punished enough.... But nobody
can forget it for a moment.... I can't forget it.... Peter can't forget
it.... If Peter wasn't a fool he'd chuck it.... He must see how hopeless

such a misery to myself and other people? Nothing more than thousands of
women ...

==> Round and round, like a squirrel in a cage, till at last Harriet had to <==
say firmly too herself: This won't do, or I shall go potty myself. I'd
better keep my mind on the job. What's taken Peter to York? Miss de
Vine? If I hadn't lost my temper I might have found out, instead of
wasting time in quarrelling. I wonder if he's made any notes on the
dossier.

He had tried standing aside. 'I have been running away from myself for
twenty years, and it doesn't work.' He no longer believed that the
Ethiopian could change his skin to rhinoceros hide. Even in the five

protections, layer by layer, till there was uncommonly little left but
the naked truth.

That, then, was what he wanted her for. For some reason, obscure to
herself and probably also to him, she had the power to force him outside

own part in the comedy. His own needs were (as he saw the matter)
getting between her and her legitimate way of escape. They involved her
in difficulties which he could not share, because she had consistently
refused him the right to share them. He had nothing of his nephew's
cheerful readiness to take and have. Careless, selfish little beast,

... It was just conceivable, by the way, that Peter was quite plainly
and simply and humanly jealous of his nephew--not, of course, of his
relations with Harriet (which would be disgusting and ridiculous), but
of the careless young egotism which made those relations possible.

On the following night, a strange and sinister thing happened.

==> Harriet had gone, by appointment, to dine with her Somerville friend, <==
and to meet a distinguished writer on the mid-Victorian period, from
whom she expected to gain some useful information about Lefanu. She was
sitting in the friend's room, where about half a dozen people were
gathering to do honour to the distinguished writer, when the telephone
rang.

gathering to do honour to the distinguished writer, when the telephone
rang.

'Oh, Miss Vane,' said her hostess. 'Somebody wants you from Shrewsbury.'

==> Harriet excused herself to the distinguished guest, and went out into <==
the small lobby in which the telephone was placed. A voice which she
could not quite recognise answered her 'Hullo!'

'Is that Miss Vane?'

'Very good, miss. Thank you.'

==> The connection was severed. Harriet hurriedly got hold of her friend, <==
explained that she had been called away suddenly, said her good-byes and
hurried out.

She had crossed the Garden Quad and was just passing between the Old
Hall and the Maitland Buildings, when she was visited with an absurd

'Is that Dr. Baring's maid?'

'Yes, madam. Who is speaking, please?'

'No--see if you can get Miss Lydgate.'

Another pause. Was Miss Lydgate also out of her room? Was every reliable
don in College out, or out of her room? Yes--Miss Lydgate was out, too;
==> and then it occurred to Harriet that, of course, they were dutifully <==
patrolling the College before turning in to bed. However, there was
Padgett. She explained matters as well as she could to him.

'Very good, miss,' said Padgett, comfortingly. 'Yes, miss--I can leave
Mrs. Padgett on the Lodge. I'll get down to the private gate and have a

'Very good, miss.'

burned dimly in the entrance-hall. She looked at the clock. Seven
minutes to eleven. She would be late. However, the assailant, if there
was one, would wait for her. She knew where the trap would be--must be.
Nobody would start a riot just outside the Infirmary or the Warden's
Lodgings, where people might overhear and come out. Nor would anyone

reasonable lurking-place was the bushes in the Fellows' Garden, near the
gate, on the right side of the path as you went up.

One would be prepared, and that was an advantage; and Padgett would be
somewhere at hand; but there would be a nasty moment when one had to

thought of the bread-knife in the dummy, and shuddered.

If she bungled it and got killed--melodramtic, but possible, when people
weren't quite sane--Peter would have something to say about it. Perhaps
it would be only decent to apologise beforehand, in case. She found

==> Harriet stepped into the Fellows' Garden, switched on her torch and <==
looked round. The garden was empty. She suddenly felt a complete fool.
Yet, when all was said and done, there must have been some reason for
that telephone call.

She made her way towards the St. Cross Lodge. In the New Quad she met

She made her way towards the St. Cross Lodge. In the New Quad she met
Padgett.

'Ah!' said Padgett, cautiously. 'She was there right enough, miss.' His

suspiciously like a cosh. 'Sittin' on the bench be'ind them laurels near
the gate. I crep' along careful, like it was a night reconnaissance,
miss, and 'id be'ind them centre shrubs. She didn't tumble to me, miss,
But when you an' Dr. Baring come through the gate a-talking, she was up
and orf like a shot.'

'Illyard. She come out at the top end of the Garden, miss, and away to
her own rooms. I follored 'er and see 'er go up. Going very quick she
was. I stepped out o' the gate, and I see the light go up in her
window.'

==> 'Oh!' said Harriet. 'Look here, Padgett, I don't want anything said <==
about this. I know Miss Hillyard does sometimes take a stroll in the
Fellows' Garden at night. Perhaps the person who sent the telephone call
saw her there and went away again.'

'Yes, miss. It's a funny thing about that there telephone call. It

'Mrs. Padgett will know, miss. I'll send you up a list of the names. Or
if you like to step into Lodge now--'

'Better not. No--give me the list in the morning.'

==> Harriet went away and found Miss Edwards, of whose discretion and common <==
sense she had a high opinion, and told her the story of the 'phone call.

'You see,' said Harriet, 'if there _had_ been any disturbance, the call
might have been intended to prove an alibi, though I don't quite see
how. Otherwise, why try to get me back at eleven? I mean, if the

having done it myself.'

directed to the 'provenance' of the set, and a long discussion about

'Not at any price.'

'Who are you calling a bloody Welshman?' snarled the young man, much

Mr. Pomfret, much subdued and tending to become lachrymose, muttered
that he was sorry to have made a row. 'But why did you make fun of me

'I didn't, Mr. Pomfret. You're quite mistaken.'

'Damn your senior members!' said Mr. Pomfret.

all the names you've got. What your nephew calls "Uncle Peter at his

to think of it, that's an idea. Shall I offer him the choice of swords

'Is it?' said Peter, addressing the envelope. 'I've never challenged
anybody. It would be fun. I've been challenged three times and fought
twice; the third time the police butted in. I'm afraid that was because

Accordingly, she put a bold face on it, marched her forces openly into

'I will give you a pawn,' suggested Miss de Vine.

thirdly, because the anguish of parting at one fell swoop with a

'Hullo!' said he. 'Why the floral emblems?'

the roses. 'Let me also be there with a gift.

birth"?'

scholastic agencies and the small and inferior private schools, because
it seems probable--You're not attending.'

==> 'Yes, I am,' said Harriet, vaguely. 'He had a wife called Charlotte and <==
you're looking for him in a private school.' A rich, damp fragrance
gushed out upon them as they turned into the Market, and she was
overcome by a sense of extravagant well-being. 'I love this smell--it's
like the cactus-house in the Botanical Gardens.'

name to the person we want, isn't it? But proof's a different matter.
We've tied the thing up so tight. That lecture-room episode was meant to

excitement had already flickered out.

'Lord Peter Wimsey has been to see me,' she said, 'with a rather curious

person--who might be quite innocent--without proof either way. He
replied that those were precisely the objections that had occurred to
him. Do you know the name of the person to whom he alludes, Miss Vane?'

==> 'No,' said Harriet, who had been exercising her wits in the interval. 'I <==
am beginning to have an idea; but I can't make it fit. In fact, I simply
can't believe it.'

'Very well. Lord Peter then made a very remarkable proposition. He asked
whether I would allow him to interrogate this person privately, in the

whether any direct evidence could be produced at this stage. I inquired
whether there was any reason why we should not at least wait for the
production of the additional evidence.'

==> Dr. Baring paused and looked keenly at Harriet. <==

'He replied that there was only one reason, and that was the culprit,
instead of becoming more cautious, might throw caution to the winds and
proceed to direct violence. "In which case," he said, "we should very
likely catch her, but only at the cost of somebody's death or serious

had said the most probable victims were--yourself, Miss de Vine and
another person whom he could not name, but whose existence, he said, he
deduced. He also surprised me by saying that an abortive attack had
already been made upon you. Is that true?'

==> 'I shouldn't have put it as strongly as that,' said Harriet. She briefly <==
outlined the story of the telephone call. At the name of Miss Hillyard,
the Warden looked up:

'Do I understand that you entertain a definite suspicion of Miss
Hillyard?'

do so. But I'm bound to say that she doesn't seem to fit in at all with
the line of Lord Peter's inquiries, so far as I am acquainted with
them.'

it would be better to wait for the further evidence. But that decision
must, of course, be subject to the willingness of yourself and Miss de
Vine to face the risks involved. The willingness of the unknown third
party cannot, naturally, be ascertained.'

==> 'I don't in the least mind what risks _I_ take,' said Harriet. 'But Miss <==
de Vine ought to be warned, I suppose.'

'That is what I said. Lord Peter agreed.'

So, thought Harriet, something has decided him to acquit Miss de Vine.

became aware of a curious change in the atmosphere of the Senior Common
Room. It was as though they had lost sight of their mutual distrust and
their general apprehensions and had drawn together like spectators at
the ring-side to watch another kind of conflict, in which she was one of
the principals. The curious tension thus produced was scarcely relieved

'I don't know whose it can be,' said Miss Lydgate. She fingered it

conscience-stricken.

On the steps, just coming out, she met Miss Hillyard.

'Were you looking for me?' asked Harriet, a little aggressively.

At a quarter to ten, Harriet, after an hour or so spent with Miss
Lydgate on her proofs--now actually nearing the stage when they might
really be sent to the printer--crossed the Old Quad to Tudor Building.
On the steps, just coming out, she met Miss Hillyard.

==> 'Were you looking for me?' asked Harriet, a little aggressively. <==

'No,' said Miss Hillyard, 'I wasn't. Certainly not.' She spoke
hurriedly, and Harriet fancied that there was something in her eyes both
furtive and malicious; but the evening was dark for the middle of May,
and she could not be sure.

furtive and malicious; but the evening was dark for the middle of May,
and she could not be sure.

==> 'Oh!' said Harriet. 'I thought you might be.' <==

'Well, I wasn't,' said Miss Hillyard again. And as Harriet passed her
she turned back and said, almost as though the words were forced out of
her:

'I hope you will have a pleasant evening,' said Miss Hillyard.

Harriet went on upstairs and opened the door of her room.

The glass case had been shattered, and the floor was strewn with broken
glass and with smashed and trampled fragments of red and white ivory.

==> For about five minutes, Harriet was the prey of that kind of speechless <==
rage which is beyond expression or control. If she had thought of it,
she was at that moment in a mood to sympathise with the Poltergeist and
all her works. If she could have beaten or strangled anybody, she would
have done it and felt the better for it. Happily, after the first
devastating fury, she found the relief of bad language. When she found

understand what she said. When he did understand, he was maddeningly
cool about it, merely asking whether she had touched anything or told
anybody. When assured that she had not he replied cheerfully that he
would be along in a few minutes.

==> Harriet went out and raged distractedly about the New Quad till she <==
heard him ring--for the gates were now shut--and only a last lingering
vestige of self-restraint prevented her from rushing at him and pouring
out her indignation in the presence of Padgett. But she waited for him
in the middle of the quad.

When he saw the room, Wimsey looked grave enough.

'Yes,' he said, kneeling amid the wreckage. 'Blind, bestial malignity.
Not only broken but ground to powder. There's been a heel at work here,
as well as the poker; you can see the marks on the carpet. She hates
==> you, Harriet. I didn't realise that. I thought she was only afraid of <==
you ... Is there yet any that is left of the house of Saul?... Look! one
poor warrior hiding behind the coal-scuttle--remnant of a mighty army.'

He held up the solitary red pawn, smiling; and then scrambled hurriedly
to his feet.

'My dear girl, don't cry about it. What the hell does it matter?'

He shook his head.

'It's a pity it's that way round. "You gave them to me, and I loved

'Miss Hillyard.'

'Again!'

==> While Harriet told her story he fidgeted restlessly about the room, <==
avoiding the broken glass and ivory on the floor with the automatic
precision of a cat, and stood at length in the window with his back to
her. She had drawn the curtains together when she had brought him up,
and his gaze at them seemed purely preoccupied.

'Hell!' he said, presently. 'That's a devil of a complication.' He still
had the red pawn in his hand, and he now came back, and set it with
great precision in the centre of the mantelpiece. 'Yes. Well, I suppose
you'll have to find out--'

==> Somebody knocked at the door, and Harriet went to open it. <==

'Excuse me, madam, but Padgett sent over to the Senior Common Room to
see if Lord Peter Wimsey was there, and seeing he thought you might
know--'

'I don't; but I don't want people walking over that floor.' He stopped
on the staircase to examine the sole of his shoes. 'I haven't carried
away any bits. Do you think you have?'

==> Harriet stood first on one leg and then another. <==

'Not this time. And the first time I didn't walk into the mess at all. I
stood in the doorway and swore.'

'Good girl. The paths in the quad are a bit damp, you know, and

'It doesn't matter. Oh, Peter! I've got that white scarf of yours.'

'Keep it till I come again--which will be to-morrow, with luck, and
otherwise, God knows when. Damn it! I knew there was trouble coming.' He
==> stood still under the beech-trees. 'Harriet, don't choose the moment my <==
back's turned to get wiped out or anything--not if you can help it; I
mean, you're not very good at looking after valuables.'

'I might have the decency to take care? All right, Peter. I'll do my

'I might have the decency to take care? All right, Peter. I'll do my

==> She gave him her hand and he kissed it. Once again Harriet thought she <==
saw somebody move in the darkness, as on the last occasion they had
walked through the shadowy quads. But she dared not delay him and so
again said nothing. Padgett let him out through the gate and Harriet,
turning away, found herself face to face with Miss Hillyard.

Miss Hillyard, without another word, led the way to her own rooms.
Harriet followed her up the stairs and into the sitting-room. The
tutor's face was very white as she shut the door after them and said,
without asking Harriet to sit down:

Miss Hillyard's dark eyes flickered.

'Certainly I did not. I told you I hadn't been anywhere near your room
to-night.'

She was too angry to be frightened, though it did cross her mind that if
the furious white-faced woman attacked her, it might be difficult to
summon assistance on this isolated staircase, and she thought of the
dog-collar.

She was prepared for anything after that, but to her surprise, Miss

(Am I a fool, she thought, showing my hand like this? But, if I didn't,

Miss Hillyard, in a bewildered way, pulled off her slipper and looked at
the sliver of white that clung to the heel, embedded in a little patch
of damp gravel.

==> 'Give it to me,' said Harriet, and took slipper and all. <==

She had expected an outburst of denial, but Miss Hlllyard said, faintly:

'That's evidence ... incontrovertible....'

'You've no evidence that I did it,' said Miss Hillyard, with sudden

was glad to see it. But he'll tell you that's no proof that I did it.'

suspicion and a dreadful kind of pity, 'you must understand, once and
for all, that he is not my lover. Do you really imagine that if he were,
we should--' here her sense of the ludicrous overcame her and made it
difficult to control her voice--'we should come and misbehave ourselves

'Don't talk nonsense,' said the tutor roughly. 'You know you're in love

'For Heaven's sake,' said Miss Hillyard, 'go away!'

She did not know how to deal with the situation at all. She could no
longer feel outraged or angry. She was not alarmed. She was not jealous.
She was only sorry, and quite incapable of expressing any sympathy which
would not be an insult. She realised that she was still clutching Miss

something. But of what? The whole business of the Poltergeist seemed to
have retreated over the horizon, leaving behind it the tormented shell
of a woman staring blindly into vacancy under the cruel harshness of the

the writing-table--the little spearhead from a red pawn.

Well, whatever one's personal feelings, evidence was evidence.

'Please do. Something's happened. Not alarming, but upsetting. I can't

the slipper and the piece of ivory carefully away, went to the Bursar,
and was accommodated with a bed in the Infirmary.

He sat up and tapped the sole of the slipper lightly with the callipers.
'Who goes there? France--Pass, France, and all's well.'

restlessness--or perhaps it was with having slept badly in an unfamiliar
bed and with a disturbed mind. The sun had scattered diamonds among the
wet grass of the quadrangle, and the breeze was shaking the rain in a
heavy spatter of drops from the beeches. Students came and went.
Somebody had left a scarlet cushion out all night in the rain; it was

entrance. She had intended to go upstairs but, seeing the door of Miss
de Vine's set stand open, she altered her mind; she could borrow a book
from there. The little lobby was empty, but in the sitting-room a scout
was giving the writing-table a Sunday-morning flick with the duster.

warned when she returned.

'What time does Miss de Vine get back to-night? Do you know, Nellie?'

she told herself, was getting on. If Peter had to get to his destination

Miss Hillyard went on resolutely. 'When I spoke to you last night I was
under a misapprehension. I had not fully realised the difficulty of your
position. I am afraid I have unwittingly made it harder for you, and I
apologise.'

==> 'That's all right,' said Harriet, taking refuge in formula. 'I am sorry <==
too. I was rather upset last night and said a great deal more than I
should. This wretched business has made everything so uncomfortable.'

'Indeed it has,' said Miss Hillyard, in a more natural voice. 'We are
all feeling rather overwrought. I wish we could get at the truth of it.

'Appearances can be very misleading,' said Miss Hillyard.

There was a pause.

==> 'Well,' said Harriet at last, 'I hope we may forget all this.' She knew <==
as she spoke that one thing at least had been said which could never be
forgotten: she would have given a great deal to recall it.

'I shall do my best,' replied Miss Hillyard. 'Perhaps I am too much
inclined to judge harshly of matters outside my experience.'

forgotten: she would have given a great deal to recall it.

'I shall do my best,' replied Miss Hillyard. 'Perhaps I am too much
inclined to judge harshly of matters outside my experience.'

==> 'It is very kind of you to say that,' said Harriet. 'Please believe that <==
I don't take a very self-satisfied view of myself either.'

'Very likely not. I have noticed that the people who get opportunities
always seem to choose the wrong ones. But it's no affair of mine. Good
morning.'

'Very likely not. I have noticed that the people who get opportunities
always seem to choose the wrong ones. But it's no affair of mine. Good
morning.'

==> She went as abruptly as she had come. Harriet glanced at the book on her <==
knee and discovered that she was reading _The Anatomy of Melancholy_.

'_Fleat Heraclitus an rideat Democritus?_ In attempting to speak of
these Symptoms, shall I laugh with _Democritus_ or weep with
_Heraclitus_? they are so ridiculous and absurd on the one side, so

lamentable and tragical on the other.'

                 *        *        *        *        *

==> Harriet got the car out in the afternoon and took Miss Lydgate and the <==
Dean for a picnic in the neighbourhood of Hinksey. When she got back, in
time for supper, she found an urgent message at the Lodge, asking her to
ring up Lord Saint-George at the House as soon as she got back. His
voice, when he answered the call, sounded agitated.

either, so I've been sitting here all evening in a devil of a stew.
First I thought I'd leave a note, and then I thought I'd better tell you
myself. Rather devoted of me, don't you think? I cut a supper-party so
as not to miss you.'

==> 'That was frightfully kind of you,' said Harriet. 'What was the ghost <==
dressed in?'

'Oh--one of those sort of dark-blue frocks with spriggy bits on it and a
hat with a brim. Sort of thing most of your dons wear in the afternoon.
Neat, not gaudy. Not smart. Just ordinary. It was the eyes I recognised.

hat with a brim. Sort of thing most of your dons wear in the afternoon.
Neat, not gaudy. Not smart. Just ordinary. It was the eyes I recognised.
Made me feel all goose-flesh. Honest. That woman's not safe, I'll swear
she isn't.'

==> 'It's very good of you to warn me,' said Harriet again. 'I'll try and <==
find out who it could have been. And I'll take precautions.'

'Please do,' said Lord Saint-George. 'I mean, Uncle Peter's getting the
wind up horribly. Gone clean off his oats. Of course I know he's a
fidgety old ass and I've been doing my best to soothe the troubled

'Please do,' said Lord Saint-George. 'I mean, Uncle Peter's getting the
wind up horribly. Gone clean off his oats. Of course I know he's a
fidgety old ass and I've been doing my best to soothe the troubled
breast and all that, but I'm beginning to think he's got some excuse.
==> For goodness' sake, Aunt Harriet, do something about it. I can't afford <==
to have a valuable uncle destroyed under my eyes. He's getting like the
Lord of Burleigh, you know--walking up and pacing down and so on--and
the responsibility is very wearing.'

to have a valuable uncle destroyed under my eyes. He's getting like the
Lord of Burleigh, you know--walking up and pacing down and so on--and
the responsibility is very wearing.'

==> 'I'll tell you what,' said Harriet. 'You'd better come and dine in <==
College to-morrow and see if you can spot the lady. It's no good this
evening, because so many people don't turn up to Sunday supper.'

'Right-ho!' said the viscount. 'That's a dashed good idea. I'd get a

                 *        *        *        *        *

==> 'I ought to have thought of that before,' said Harriet, retailing this <==
piece of news to the Dean; 'but I never imagined he'd recognise the
woman like that after only seeing her once.'

The Dean, to whom the whole story of Lord Saint-George's ghostly
encounter had come as a novelty, was inclined to be sceptical.

that. The only person here I know of with a navy sprigged foulard is
Miss Lydgate, and I absolutely refuse to believe _that_! But ask the
young man to dinner by all means. I'm all for excitement, and he's even
more ornamental than the other one.'

==> It was borne in upon Harriet that things were coming to a crisis. 'Take <==
precautions.' A nice fool she would look, going about with a dog-collar
round her neck. Nor would it be any defence against pokers and such
things.... The wind must be in the south-west, for the heavy boom of Tom
tolling his hundred-and-one came clearly to her ears as she crossed the
Old Quad.

yourself elsewhere with--say--Viennese singers, presenting an unruffled
surface on both sides of yourself. Easy for a man, and possible even for
a woman, if one avoided foolish accidents like being tried for murder.
But to seek to force incompatibles into a compromise was madness; one
should neither do it nor be a party to it. If Peter wanted to make the
==> experiment, he must do it without Harriet's connivance. Six centuries of <==
possessive blood would not be dictated to by a bare forty-five years of
over-sensitised intellect. Let the male animal take the female and be
content; the busy brain could very well be 'left talking' like the hero
of _Man and Superman_. In a long monologue, of course; for the female
animal could only listen without contributing. Otherwise one would get

red pawn mocked all security ... How quietly Annie had taken Peter's
warning. Did she take it seriously? Was she looking after herself? She
had been her usual refined and self-contained self when she brought in
the Common-room coffee that night--perhaps a little brighter looking
than usual. Of course, she had had her afternoon off with Beatie and
==> Carola.... Curious, thought Harriet, this desire to possess children and <==
dictate their tastes, as though they were escaping fragments of one's
self, and not separate individuals. Even if the taste ran to motor
bikes.... Annie was all right. How about Miss de Vine, travelling down
from Town in happy ignorance?--With a start, Harriet saw that it was
nearly a quarter to ten. The train must be in. Had the Warden remembered

anything.

nearly a quarter to ten. The train must be in. Had the Warden remembered
about warning Miss de Vine? She ought not to be left to sleep in that
ground-floor room without being forearmed. But the Warden never forgot
anything.

==> Nevertheless, Harriet was uneasy. From her window she could not see <==
whether any lights were on in the Library Wing. She unlocked the door
and stepped out (yes--the passage window was open; nobody but the wind
had rattled the handle). A few dim figures were still moving at the far
end of the quad as she passed along beside the tennis court. In the
Library Wing, all the ground-floor windows were dark except for the dim

glow of the passage-light. Miss Barton, at any rate, was not in her
room; nor was Miss de Vine back yet. Or--yes, she must be; for the
window-curtains were drawn in her sitting-room, though no light shone as
yet behind them.

==> Harriet went into the building. The door of Miss Burrows' set stood <==
open, and the lobby was dark. Miss de Vine's door was shut. She knocked,
but there was no answer--and it suddenly struck her as odd that the
curtains should be drawn and no light on. She opened the door and
pressed down the wall switch in the lobby. Nothing happened. With a
growing sense of disquiet, she went on to the sitting-room door and

bright light in the Infirmary would have been very pleasant, if it
hadn't been for the oppressive neighbourhood of the person with the
headache, who was, moreover, groaning very disagreeably. It was an
effort to pull one's self together and find out what the tiresome person
wanted. With an effort like that of a hippopotamus climbing out of a
==> swamp, Harriet pulled herself together and discovered that the headache <==
and the groans were her own, and that the Infirmarian had realised what
she was about and was coming to lend a hand.

'What in the world--?' said Harriet.

she was about and was coming to lend a hand.

'Ah,' said the Infirmarian, 'that's better, No--don't try to sit up.
You've had a nasty knock on the head, and the quieter you keep the
better.'

==> 'Oh, I see,' said Harriet. 'I've got a beast of a headache.' A little <==
thought located the worst part of the headache somewhere behind the
right ear. She put up an exploratory hand and encountered a bandage.
'What happened?'

'That's what we'd all like to know,' said the Infirmarian.

It was not till the evening, when the Dean came in and found the patient

story of the night's adventures.

'Now, if you'll keep quiet,' said the Dean, 'I'll tell you. If not, not.
And your beautiful young man has sent you a young gardenful of flowers
and will call again in the morning. Well, now! Poor Miss de Vine got

place, and we hunted and hunted and nobody had seen anything of her. And
then, just before two, Lord Peter arrived, looking like death, and said
we were to turn the place upside down if we didn't want a corpse on our
hands. Nice and reassuring _that_ was!'

==> 'I wish I hadn't missed it all,' said Harriet. 'He must have thought I <==
was an awful ass to let myself be knocked out like that.'

'He didn't say so,' said the Dean, drily. 'He came in to see you, but of
course you were under the weather. And of course he explained about the
dog-collar, which had puzzled us all dreadfully.'

'Obviously. And with her weak heart--and no dog-collar--she wouldn't
have had much chance, or so the doctor said. It was very lucky for her
you happened to go in there. Or did you know?'

==> 'I think,' said Harriet, her memory still rather confused, 'I went to <==
tell her about Peter's warning and--oh, yes! there was something funny
about the window-curtains. And the lights were all off.'

'The bulbs had been taken out. Well, anyway, somewhere about four
o'clock, Padgett found Annie. She was locked up in the coal-cellar under

'Why, she was putting away the deck-chairs in the loggia about half-past
nine, when somebody seized her round the neck from behind and
frog's-marched her off to the cellar. She said it was a woman, and very
strong--'

==> 'She was,' said Harriet. 'I can bear witness to that. Grip like steel. <==
And a most unfeminine vocabulary.'

'Annie says she never saw who it was, but she thought that the arm that
was round her face had a dark sleeve on. Annie's own impression was that
it was Miss Hillyard; but she was with the Bursar and me. But a good

with an unaccountable desire to wander. Miss Burrows went to commune
with Nature in the Fellows' Garden and Mrs. Goodwin to commune with a
higher Authority in the Chapel. We are all looking rather askance at one
another to-day.'

==> 'I wish to goodness,' said Harriet, 'I'd been a trifle more efficient,' <==
she pondered a moment. 'I wonder why she didn't stay to finish me off.'

'Lord Peter wondered that, too. He said he thought she must either have
thought you were dead, or been alarmed by the blood and finding she'd
got the wrong person. When you went limp, she'd probably feel about and

this morning. So I comforted him with hot coffee and he went off leaving
orders that neither you nor Miss de Vine nor Annie was to be left alone
for a single moment. And he's rung up once from London and three times
from Paris.'

==> 'Poor old Peter!' said Harriet. 'He never seems to get a night's rest.' <==

'Meanwhile the Warden is valiantly issuing an unconvincing statement to
the effect that somebody played a foolish practical joke on Annie, that
you accidentally slipped and cut your head and that Miss de Vine was
upset by the sight of blood. And the College gates are shut to all

The next day brought Lord Saint-George. 'My turn to visit the sick,' he
said. 'You're a nice, restful aunt for a fellow to adopt, I don't think.
Do you realise that you've done me out of a dinner?'

might be able to identify--'

'Now don't you start laying plots,' said he, 'or your temperature will
go up. You leave it to Uncle. He says he'll be back to-morrow, by the

that side of the head. You'll have to be cropped all round to even
matters up and Uncle Peter can wear your discarded tresses next his
heart.'

Thursday. A heavy, gloomy and depressing Thursday, pouring down
uninteresting rain from a sky like a grey box-lid. The Warden had called
a meeting of the Senior Common Room for half-past two--an unconsoling
==> hour. All three invalids were up and about again. Harriet had exchanged <==
her bandages for some very unbecoming and unromantic strappings, and had
not exactly a headache, but the sensation that a headache might begin at
any moment. Miss de Vine looked like a ghost. Annie, though she had
suffered less than the others physically, seemed to be still haunted by
nervous terrors, and crept unhappily about her duties with the other

suffered less than the others physically, seemed to be still haunted by
nervous terrors, and crept unhappily about her duties with the other
Common-Room maid always closely in attendance.

It was understood that Lord Peter Wimsey would attend the S.C.R. meeting
==> in order to lay certain information before the staff. Harriet had <==
received from him a brief and characteristic note, which said:

'Congratulations on not being dead yet. I have taken your collar away to
have my name put on.'

'Not too bad, considering.'

'That's good.'

==> He smiled, and went to sit by the Warden. Harriet, at the opposite side <==
of the table, slipped into a place beside the Dean. Everything that was
alive in him lay in the palm of her hand, like a ripe apple. Dr. Baring
was asking him to begin, and he was doing so, in the flat voice of a
secretary reading the minutes of a company meeting. He had a sheaf of
papers before him, including (Harriet noticed) her dossier, which he

referring to so much as a note, addressing himself to a bowl filled with
marigolds that stood on the table before him.

'I need not take up your time by going over all the details of this

all the data necessary to the formation of the theory are contained in
the very valuable digest of the events prepared for me by Miss Vane and
handed to me on my arrival. The rest of the proof was merely what the
police call routine work.'

==> (This, thought Harriet, is suiting your style to your company with a <==
vengeance. She looked round. The Common-Room had the hushed air of a
congregation settling down to a sermon, but she could feel the nervous
tension everywhere. They did not know what they might be going to hear.)

'The first point to strike an outsider,' went on Peter, 'is the fact

experience, of limited education but some acquaintance with scholars and
scholarship, whose past was in some way linked with that of Miss de
Vine, and (though this was an assumption) who had probably come into
residence later than last December.'

==> Harriet twisted her glance away from Peter's hand, which had ceased its <==
soft drumming and now lay flat on the table, to estimate the effect of
this on his hearers. Miss de Vine was frowning as though her mind,
running back over the years, were dispassionately considering her claim
to have done murder; Miss Chilperic's face wore a troubled blush, and
Mrs. Goodwin's an air of protest; in Miss Hillyard's eyes was an

her relations and Annie's children were sent away to Headington. And in
order that we should feel quite sure that the Jukes household had
nothing to do with the matter, a mutilated newspaper appeared shortly
afterwards in Miss de Vine's room.'

'I did work that out--eventually. But what happened last week seemed to
make it quite impossible.'

'Miss Vane has been helping me so generously with my books,' murmured
Miss Lydgate, contritely; 'and she has had her own work to do as well.
We really ought not to have asked her to spare any time for our
problems.'

==> 'I had plenty of time,' said Harriet. 'I was only stupid.' <==

'At any rate,' said Wimsey, 'Miss Vane did enough to make X feel she was
dangerous. At the beginning of this term, we find X becoming more
desperate and more deadly in intention. With the lighter evenings, it
becomes more difficult to play tricks at night. There is the

unexpected. It looked less like alarm than personal hatred. Up till that
time, Miss Vane had been treated with almost as much tenderness as
though she had been a womanly woman. Can you think of anything that can
have given X that impression, Miss Vane?'

==> 'I don't know,' said Harriet, confused. 'I asked kindly after the <==
children and spoke to Beatie--good Heavens, yes, Beatie!--when I met
them. And I remember once agreeing politely with Annie that marriage
might be a good thing if one could find the right person.'

'That was politic if unprincipled. And how about the attentive Mr. Jones

theory; especially as I didn't get the report from my research-staff
till yesterday. But when you come to think of it, what else could she
do? She laid a plot to attack Miss de Vine on her return from Town--the
scouts probably knew which train she was coming by.'

==> 'Nellie knew,' said Harriet. <==

'Then she could have told Annie. By an extraordinary piece of good
fortune, the attack was delivered--not against Miss de Vine, who would
have been taken unawares and whose heart is not strong, but against a
younger and stronger woman, who was, up to a certain point, prepared to

younger and stronger woman, who was, up to a certain point, prepared to
meet it. Even so, it was serious enough, and might easily have proved
fatal. I find it difficult to forgive myself for not having spoken
earlier--with or without proof--and put the suspect under observation.'

==> 'Oh, nonsense!' said Harriet, quickly. 'If you had, she might have <==
chucked the whole thing for the rest of the term, and we should still
not know anything definite. I wasn't much hurt.'

'No. But it might not have been you. I knew you were ready to take the
risk; but I had no right to expose Miss de Vine.'

door on herself and proceeded to cover up Miss Vane's blood-stains with
her own. By the way, Miss Vane, if you remembered anything of your
lesson, you must have marked her wrists for her.'

==> 'I'll swear I did,' said Harriet. <==

'But any amount of bruising may be caused by trying to scramble through
a ventilator. Well. The evidence, you see, is still circumstantial--even
though my nephew is prepared to identify the woman he saw crossing
Magdalen Bridge on Wednesday with the woman he met in the garden. One

paper--he only put it away. It made no difference to anybody. It
wouldn't have helped a single man or woman or child in the world--it
wouldn't have kept a cat alive; but you killed him for it.'

Peter had got up and stood behind Miss de Vine, with his hand over her

won't make her pulse miss a single beat. The rest of the Common-Room
looked merely stunned.

None of them feel anything. You brazen devils--you all stand together.

'I apologise for allowing this scene to take place. I ought to have

with unseeing eyes into the quad, 'and that is, that if I once gave way
to Peter, I should go up like straw.'

'That,' said Miss de Vine drily, 'is moderately obvious. How often has

for him. But I really don't think you can go on like this. You won't
break his patience or his control or his spirit; but you may break his
health. He looks like a person pushed to the last verge of endurance.'

defensively. 'I shouldn't be at all a comfortable person for him to live

'Then,' said Miss de Vine, 'I suggest that you stop hurting other
people. Face the facts and state a conclusion. Bring a scholar's mind to
the problem and have done with it.'

me. Miss Lydgate's _History of Prosody_ was marked PRESS with her own
hand this morning. I fled with it and seized on a student to take it
down to the printers. I'm almost positive I heard a faint voice crying
from the window about a footnote on page 97--but I pretended not to
hear.'

Lefanu, and went down to put in a little solid work at the Camera.
