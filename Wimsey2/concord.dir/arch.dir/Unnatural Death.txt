I’m not just being the perfect listener. I have deceived you. I have an
ulterior motive, said he, throwing off his side-whiskers and disclosing
the well-known hollow jaws of Mr. Sherlock Holmes.”

“I was beginning to have my suspicions,” said the doctor, after a short
==> pause. “I think you must be Lord Peter Wimsey. I wondered why your face <==
was so familiar, but of course it was in all the papers a few years ago
when you disentangled the Riddlesdale Mystery.”

“Quite right. It’s a silly kind of face, of course, but rather
disarming, don’t you think? I don’t know that I’d have chosen it, but I

altogether and end up as one of those drunken ship’s doctors in the
South Seas or somewhere, who are always telling their life-history to
people and delivering awful warnings. Better to let sleeping dogs lie.
Thanks very much, all the same.”

==> “As you like,” said Wimsey. “But I’ll think it over, and if any useful <==
suggestion occurs to me, I’ll let you know.”

“It’s very good of you,” replied the visitor, absently, taking his hat
and stick from the man-servant, who had answered Wimsey’s ring. “Well,
good night, and many thanks for hearing me so patiently. By the way,

though,” he added, turning suddenly at the door, “how do you propose to
let me know when you haven’t got my name and address?”

Lord Peter laughed.

“What do you really think of that story?” inquired Parker. He had
==> dropped in to breakfast with Wimsey the next morning, before departing <==
in the Notting Dale direction, in quest of an elusive anonymous
letter-writer. “I thought it sounded rather as though our friend had
been a bit too cocksure about his grand medical specialising. After all,
the old girl might so easily have had some sort of heart attack. She was
very old and ill.”

much touched and pleased.”

He laughed a little self-consciously.

“Oh,” said Parker, embarrassed. Although the men were great friends,
==> Wimsey had always preserved a reticence about his personal affairs—not <==
so much by concealing as by ignoring them. This revelation seemed to
mark a new stage of intimacy, and Parker was not sure that he liked it.
He conducted his own life with an earnest middle-class morality which he
owed to his birth and up-bringing, and, while theoretically recognising
that Lord Peter’s world acknowledged different standards, he had never

owed to his birth and up-bringing, and, while theoretically recognising
that Lord Peter’s world acknowledged different standards, he had never
contemplated being personally faced with any result of their application
in practice.

she’s quite comfortably fixed in a little flat in Pimlico. You can come,
can’t you, Charles? I really should like you two to meet.”

“Oh, yes, rather,” said Parker, hastily, “I should like to very much.
Er—how long—I mean—”

can’t you, Charles? I really should like you two to meet.”

“Oh, yes, rather,” said Parker, hastily, “I should like to very much.
Er—how long—I mean—”

==> “Oh, the arrangement’s only been going a few months,” said Wimsey, <==
leading the way to the lift, “but it really seems to be working out
quite satisfactorily. Of course, it makes things much easier for me.”

“Just so,” said Parker.

“Just so,” said Parker.

“Of course, as you’ll understand—I won’t go into it all till we get
==> there, and then you’ll see for yourself,” Wimsey chattered on, slamming <==
the gates of the lift with unnecessary violence—“but, as I was saying,
you’ll observe it’s quite a new departure. I don’t suppose there’s ever
been anything exactly like it before. Of course, there’s nothing new
under the sun, as Solomon said, but after all, I daresay all those wives
and porcupines, as the child said, must have soured his disposition a

“Quite,” said Parker. “Poor fish,” he added to himself, “they _always_
seem to think it’s different.”

==> “Outlet,” said Wimsey, energetically, “hi! taxi! . . . outlet—everybody <==
needs an outlet—97A, St. George’s Square—and after all, one can’t really
blame people if it’s just that they need an outlet. I mean, why be
bitter? They can’t help it. I think it’s much kinder to give them an
outlet than to make fun of them in books—and, after all, it isn’t really
difficult to write books. Especially if you either write a rotten story

get nowadays, Mr. Parker. I should have liked a good education, but my
dear father didn’t believe in it for women. Very old-fashioned, you
young people would think him.”

==> “Never mind, Miss Climpson,” said Wimsey, “you’ve got just exactly the <==
qualifications we want, and they’re rather rare, so we’re in luck. Now
we want this matter pushed forward as fast as possible.”

“I’ll go down to Somerset House at once,” replied the lady, with great
energy, “and let you know the minute I’m ready to start for Hampshire.”

“Dear me,” said Miss Climpson, “I don’t—”

rapidly, “and you will let me have a note of the expenses in your usual
business-like way.”

“Of course.” Miss Climpson was dignified. “And I will give you a proper

The little red-headed nurse gave her visitor a quick, slightly hostile
look-over.

“It’s quite all right,” he said apologetically, “I haven’t come to sell
you soap or gramophones, or to borrow money or enroll you in the Ancient
==> Froth-blowers or anything charitable. I really am Lord Peter Wimsey—I <==
mean, that really is my title, don’t you know, not a Christian name like
Sanger’s Circus or Earl Derr Biggers. I’ve come to ask you some
questions, and I’ve no real excuse, I’m afraid, for butting in on you—do
you ever read the _News of the World_?”

“Perhaps you’re right,” said Nurse Philliter, thoughtfully. “But,” she
added suddenly, “that’s no motive for murdering a perfectly innocent old
lady.”

==> “That’s the second time you’ve used that word,” said Wimsey, gravely. <==
“There’s no proof yet that it was murder.”

“I know that.”

“But you think it was?”

“Excuse me, I’m sure, but you’re in request this afternoon, Philliter.
Here’s Dr. Carr come for you.”

speechless.

“I told you I’d be turnin’ up again before long,” said Lord Peter,
cheerfully. “Sherlock is my name and Holmes is my nature. I’m delighted
to see you, Dr. Carr. Your little matter is well in hand, and seein’ I’m

Parker. “I don’t believe there’s the slightest reason for supposing that
there was anything odd about the Dawson woman’s death. You’ve nothing to
go on but a conceited young doctor’s opinion and a lot of silly gossip.”

“Oh, but Miss Whittaker is a trained nurse. She was surely capable
enough to see to her aunt herself.”

with emphasis.

can’t do any harm.”

“His lordship is in his bath, sir. Shall I put you through?”

“Please,” said Parker.

“Not exactly. It lay among some bushes—the sort of place where a
frolicsome young couple might go to play hide-and-seek.”

“Or where a murderer might go to play hide and let the police seek,”

“Well, well. Have it your own way,” said Sir Andrew, smiling. “If it was
murder, it must have been a poisoning job, for, as I say, there was not
the slightest sign of a wound or a struggle. I’ll let you have the
report of the autopsy. In the meanwhile, if you’d like to run down there

the slightest sign of a wound or a struggle. I’ll let you have the
report of the autopsy. In the meanwhile, if you’d like to run down there
with Inspector Parker, you can of course have any facilities you want.
And if you discover anything, let me know.”

==> Wimsey thanked him, and collecting Parker from an adjacent office, <==
rushed him briskly down the corridor.

“I don’t like it,” he said, “that is, of course, it’s very gratifying to
know that our first steps in psychology have led to action, so to speak,
but I wish to God it hadn’t been quite such decisive action. We’d better

of some kind a bit further away. Make a circle, and report anything you
see. And you oughtn’t to have let all that bunch of people get so near.
Put a cordon round and tell ’em to move on. Have you seen all you want,
Peter?”

==> Wimsey had been poking his stick aimlessly into the bole of an oak-tree <==
at a few yards’ distance. Now he stooped and lifted out a package which
had been stuffed into a cleft. The two policemen hurried forward with
eager interest, which evaporated somewhat at sight of the find—a ham
sandwich and an empty Bass bottle, roughly wrapped up in a greasy
newspaper.

newspaper.

“Picnickers,” said Walmisley, with a snort. “Nothing to do with the
body, I daresay.”

==> “I think you’re mistaken,” said Wimsey, placidly. “When did the girl <==
disappear, exactly?”

“Well, she went off duty at the Corner House at five a week ago
to-morrow, that’s Wednesday, 27th,” said Parker.

“Well, she went off duty at the Corner House at five a week ago

Final edition. Now that edition isn’t on the streets till about 6
o’clock. So unless somebody brought it down and had supper here, it was
probably brought by the girl herself or her companion. It’s hardly
likely anyone would come and picnic here afterwards, not with the body
there. Not that bodies need necessarily interfere with one’s enjoyment

“That’s true, sir. But you’re assuming the death took place on the
Wednesday or Thursday. She may have been somewhere else—living with
someone in town or anywhere.”

==> “Crushed again,” said Wimsey. “Still, it’s a curious coincidence.” <==

“It is, my lord, and I’m very glad you found the things. Will you take
charge of ’em, Mr. Parker, or shall I?”

“Better take them along and put them with the other things,” said

“It is, my lord, and I’m very glad you found the things. Will you take
charge of ’em, Mr. Parker, or shall I?”

“Better take them along and put them with the other things,” said
==> Parker, extending his hand to take them from Wimsey, whom they seemed to <==
interest quite disproportionately. “I fancy his lordship’s right and
that the parcel came here along with the girl. And that certainly looks
as if she didn’t come alone. Possibly that young man of hers was with
her. Looks like the old, old story. Take care of that bottle, old man,
it may have finger-prints on it.”

as if she didn’t come alone. Possibly that young man of hers was with

==> “You can have the bottle,” said Wimsey. “May we ne’er lack a friend or a <==
bottle to give him, as Dick Swiveller says. But I earnestly beg that
before you caution your respectable young railway clerk that anything he
says may be taken down and used against him, you will cast your eye, and
your nose, upon this ham sandwich.”

weighty.”

“That’s odd, certainly,” said Parker. “I imagine that only rich people—”

“Only rich people or people who understand eating as a fine art,” said
==> Wimsey. “The two classes are by no means identical, though they <==
occasionally overlap.”

“It may be very important,” said Parker, wrapping the exhibits up
carefully. “We’d better go along now and see the body.”

The examination was not a very pleasant matter, for the weather had been
damp and warm and there had certainly been weasels. In fact, after a
==> brief glance, Wimsey left the two policemen to carry on alone, and <==
devoted his attention to the dead girl’s handbag. He glanced through the
letter from Evelyn Gotobed—(now Evelyn Cropper)——and noted down the
Canadian address. He turned the cutting of his own advertisement out of
an inner compartment, and remained for some time in consideration of the
£5 note which lay, folded up, side by side with a 10_s._ Treasury note,

filled ’em up so with stories of how fine a place London was and how
grand situations was to be had for the asking, that they was mad to go,
and she give them a present of money and behaved very handsome, take it

teapot. Was Bertha a great crockery-breaker?”

“Well, sir, she never broke nothing of mine. But this Miss
Whittaker—that was the name—she was one of these opinionated ladies, as
will ’ave their own way in everythink. A fine temper she ’ad, or so poor

peculiarities, don’t we? It’s my own belief as the lady had somebody of
her own choice as she wanted to put in the place of Bertha—that’s this
one—and Evelyn—as is now Mrs. Cropper, you understand me—and she jest
trampled up an excuse, as they say, to get rid of ’em.”

==> “Very possibly,” said Wimsey. “I suppose, Inspector, Evelyn Gotobed—” <==

“Now Mrs. Cropper,” put in Mrs. Gulliver with a sob.

“Mrs. Cropper, I should say—has been communicated with?”

The door of the flat in South Audley Street was opened by Mrs. Forrest
==> in person. Wimsey recognised her instantly from the description. On <==
seeing Parker’s card, she made no objection whatever to letting them in,
and led the way into a pink and mauve sitting-room, obviously furnished
by contract from a Regent Street establishment.

“Please sit down. Will you smoke? And your friend?”

the difference between Parker’s seven-guinea “fashionable lounge
suiting, tailored in our own workrooms, fits like a made-to-measure
suit,” and his “colleague’s” Savile Row outlines, but beyond a slight
additional defensiveness of manner she showed no disturbance. Parker
noted the glance. “She’s summing us up professionally,” was his mental

or husband or what. Never mind. Let her wonder. We may get her rattled.”

“We are engaged, Madam,” he began, with formal severity, “on an inquiry
relative to certain events connected with the 26th of last month. I
think you were in Town at that time?”

“We are engaged, Madam,” he began, with formal severity, “on an inquiry

mental note that she was not as young as her bouffant apple-green frock
made her appear. She was certainly nearing the thirties, and her eyes
were mature and aware.

“Yes, I think I was. Yes, certainly. I was in Town for several days

Parker hesitated. He rather wished now, that he had demanded point-blank
at the start how Mrs. Forrest’s £5 note had come to be found on the dead
body of the waitress at Epping. Taken by surprise, the woman might have
got flustered. Now, he had let her entrench herself securely behind this
horse story. Impossible to follow up the history of a bank-note handed
==> to an unknown bookie at a race-meeting. Before he could speak, Wimsey <==
broke in for the first time, in a high, petulant voice which quite took

care a continental curse about the beastly note, and I’m sure Sylvia
doesn’t.”

“Who is Sylvia?” demanded Mrs. Forrest with considerable amazement.

==> “Who is Sylvia? What is she?” gabbled Wimsey, irrepressibly. <==
“Shakespeare always has the right word, hasn’t he? But, God bless my
soul, it’s no laughing matter. It’s very serious and you’ve no business
to laugh at it. Sylvia is very much upset, and the doctor is afraid it
may have an effect on her heart. You may not know it, Mrs. Forrest, but
Sylvia Lyndhurst is my cousin. And what she wants to know, and what we

alarm—a kind of vicious fury, such as one may see in those of a cornered
cat.

“On the 26th?” she faltered. “I can’t—”

==> “I knew it!” cried Wimsey. “And that girl Evelyn was sure of it too. Who <==
was it, Mrs. Forrest? Answer me that!”

“There—there was no one,” said Mrs. Forrest, with a thick gasp.

“Oh, come, Mrs. Forrest, think again,” said Parker, taking his cue

“Oh, come, Mrs. Forrest, think again,” said Parker, taking his cue
promptly, “you aren’t going to tell us that you accounted by yourself
for three bottles of Veuve Clicquot and two people’s dinners.”

==> “Not forgetting the ham,” put in Wimsey, with fussy self-importance, <==
“the Bradenham ham specially cooked and sent up by Fortnum & Mason. Now,
Mrs. Forrest—”

“Wait a moment. Just a moment. I’ll tell you everything.”

The woman’s hands clutched at the pink silk cushions, making little hot,
tight creases. “I—would you mind getting me something to drink? In the
dining-room, through there—on the sideboard.”

==> Wimsey got up quickly and disappeared into the next room. He took rather <==
a long time, Parker thought. Mrs. Forrest was lying back in a collapsed
attitude, but her breathing was more controlled, and she was, he
thought, recovering her wits. “Making up a story,” he muttered savagely
to himself. However, he could not, without brutality, press her at the
moment.

myself? I’m feelin’ a bit flustered. Upsettin’, delicate business and
all that. Just another spot. That’s the idea.”

He trotted out again, glass in hand, while Parker fidgeted. The presence

in again, this time, with more common sense, bringing decanter, syphon
and three glasses, bodily, on a tray.

“Now, now,” said Wimsey, “now we’re feeling better, do you think you can
answer our question, Mrs. Forrest?”

Parker shot an exasperated glance at his friend. This came of giving

the matter! Right, indeed?”

“Murder?”

so far as I know, been murdered, nor has he murdered anybody.”

“Isn’t that asking rather much? Perhaps if you would give me further

that Evelyn girl is making trouble. In fact—of course one doesn’t want
it to go any further—but actually Sylvia lost her head very completely.

Mrs. Forrest gradually softened into a faint smile.

“I think I understand the position, Mr. Templeton,” she said, “and if I
give you a name, it will be in strict confidence, I presume?”

“You’ll swear you aren’t spies of my husband’s?” she said, quickly. “I

Mrs. Forrest shook her head.

==> “Major Lyndhurst,” put in Wimsey, plaintively. <==

“And if Mrs. Lyndhurst is not satisfied, and likes to come round and see
me, I will do my best to satisfy her of the fact. Will that do?”

“Thank you very much,” said Wimsey. “I’m sure it’s as much as any one

He teetered nervously down the narrow hall-way, in his imbecile and
well-bred way, Parker following with a policeman-like stiffness. No
==> sooner, however, had the flat-door closed behind them than Wimsey seized <==
his friend by the arm and bundled him helter-skelter into the lift.

“I thought we should never get away,” he panted. “Now quick—how do we
get round to the back of these flats?”

“What do you want with the back?” demanded Parker, annoyed. “And I wish
you wouldn’t stampede me like this. I’ve no business to let you come
with me on a job at all, and if I do, you might have the decency to keep
quiet.”

==> “Right you are,” said Wimsey, cheerfully, “just let’s do this little bit <==
and you can get all the virtuous indignation off your chest later on.
Round here, I fancy, up this back alley. Step lively and mind the
dust-bin. One, two, three, four—here we are! Just keep a look-out for
the passing stranger, will you?”

Selecting a back window which he judged to belong to Mrs. Forrest’s

the agility of a cat-burglar. About fifteen feet from the ground he
paused, reached up, and appeared to detach something with a quick jerk,
and then slid very gingerly to the ground again, holding his right hand
at a cautious distance from his body, as though it were breakable.

drunk in Mrs. Forrest’s sitting-room.

“What on earth—?” said Parker.

possibly be fatal to anybody. Besides, haven’t I told you that there was

“I see the case has more or less died out of the papers,” he resumed,
suddenly.

shrank, blackened, settled down. He stretched his hand, and the hand’s
shadow flew with it, hovering over the gilded titles of the books and
blotting them out one by one.

always been looking for. The case of cases. The murder without
discernible means, or motive or clue. The norm. All these”—he swept his
extended hand across the book-shelf, and the shadow outlined a vaster
and more menacing gesture—“all these books on this side of the room are
books about crimes. But they only deal with the abnormal crimes.”

Lord Peter unhitched Mrs. Gulliver from his arm, hitched her smartly on

looking-glass she had on the left side of the bed.”

Mr. Murbles exchanged a significant glance with Lord Peter.

woman, but I reckon blood’s thicker than water. My husband said, ‘Bring

Lord Peter took Mrs. Cropper down to Christchurch and returned to town
to have a conference with Mr. Parker. The latter had just listened to
his recital of Mrs. Cropper’s story, when the discreet opening and
closing of the flat-door announced the return of Bunter.

“We can always try them in turn, and come back if we find we’re going

At this moment the man observed their approach and, rising, advanced to

of things as would have been thought very fast in the old days, but Miss
Whittaker had the knowledge as well. Bought her own horses and physicked
’em and bred ’em, and needed no advice from anybody.”

==> “She sounds a wonderful old girl,” said Wimsey, heartily. “I’d have <==
liked to know her. I’ve got some friends who knew Miss Dawson quite
well—when she was living in Hampshire, you know.”

“Indeed, sir? Well, that’s strange, isn’t it? She was a very kind, nice
lady. We heard she’d died, too. Of this cancer, was it? That’s a

jealous of the ’osses. Said I preferred their conversation to hers.
Well, maybe she was right, sir. A ’oss never talks no foolishness, I
says to her, and that’s more than you can always say of women, ain’t it,
sir?”

==> “It is indeed,” said Wimsey. “What are you going to have?” <==

“Thank you, sir, I’ll have my usual pint of bitter. Jim knows. Jim!
Always start the day with a pint of bitter, sir. It’s ’olesomer than tea

something fretful about tea. Mr. Piggin, two pints of bitter, please,
and will you join us?”

“Thank you, my lord,” said the landlord. “Joe! Two large bitters and a
Guinness. Beautiful morning, my lord—’morning, Mr. Cobling—I see you’ve

“By Jove! So this is Mr. Cobling. I’m delighted to see you. I wanted
particularly to have a chat with you.”

“Indeed, sir?”

tell him all about Miss Whittaker and Miss Dawson. He knows friends of
Miss Dawson’s.”

“Indeed? Ah! There ain’t much I _couldn’t_ tell you about them ladies.
And proud I’d be to do it. Fifty years I was with Miss Whittaker. I come

began to work his way back to the history of the Dawson family.
Parker—educated at Barrow-in-Furness grammar school and with his wits
further sharpened in the London police service—endeavoured now and again
to get matters along faster by a brisk question. The result, every time,
was to make Mr. Cobling lose the thread of his remarks and start him off
==> into a series of interminable side-tracks. Wimsey kicked his friend <==
viciously on the anklebone to keep him quiet, and with endless patience
worked the conversation back to the main road again.

At the end of an hour or so, Mr. Cobling explained that his wife could
tell them a great deal more about Miss Dawson than what he could, and

[line number in individual story] matching line = 4638    window = 4633 4643

he was eighty-seven come next Michaelmas, and hearty still, indeed,
stronger than he appeared, bar the rheumatics that troubled him. “I’m
not saying as I’m not bent,” said Mr. Cobling, “but that’s more the work
of the ’osses. Regular lived with ’osses all my life—”

==> “Don’t look so fretful, Charles,” murmured Wimsey in his ear, “it must <==
be the tea at breakfast—it frets the coats of the stomach.”

Mrs. Cobling turned out to be a delightful old lady, exactly like a
dried-up pippin and only two years younger than her husband. She was
entranced at getting an opportunity to talk about her darling Miss

gentleman with a pleasant word for everybody. And his wife didn’t live
long after him, poor lamb. She was a Frenchwoman and a sweet lady, but
she was very lonely in England, having no family and her two sisters
walled up alive in one of them dreadful Romish Convents.

==> “And what did Mr. Stephen do when the money went?” asked Wimsey. <==

“Him? Oh, he went into business—a strange thing that did seem, though I
have heard tell as old Barnabas Dawson, Mr. Henry’s grandfather that
was, was nought but a grocer or something of that—and they do say, don’t
they, that from shirtsleeves to shirtsleeves is three generations?

with reasons, nor with threats, nor with coaxings—nothing! Many’s the
time I’ve tried when she was a child—for I used to give a little help in
the nursery sometimes, sir. You might drive her into a temper or into
the sulks, but you couldn’t make her change her little mind, even then.”

==> There came to Wimsey’s mind the picture of the stricken, helpless old <==
woman, holding to her own way in spite of her lawyer’s reasoning and her
niece’s subterfuge. A remarkable old lady, certainly, in her way.

“I suppose the Dawson family has practically died out, then,” he said.

their pictures, sir.”

Lord Peter said he should like to very much, and Parker made
confirmatory noises. The life-histories of all the children and
descendants were detailed at suitable length. Whenever a pause seemed
==> discernible, Parker would mutter hopefully in Wimsey’s car, “How about <==
Cousin Hallelujah?” but before a question could be put, the interminable
family chronicle was resumed.

“And for God’s sake, Charles,” whispered Peter, savagely, when Mrs.
Cobling had risen to hunt for the shawl which Grandson William had sent

error of his ways.

“If he’s alive,” murmured Parker, “he’s probably the real heir. He’d be
Agatha Dawson’s uncle and her nearest relation.”

==> Wimsey frowned and returned to the charge. <==

“Well, it couldn’t have been Mr. Paul I had in mind,” he said, “because
this sort of relation of Miss Agatha Dawson’s that I heard about was a
real foreigner—in fact, a very dark-complexioned man—almost a black man
or so I was told.”

was Mr. Henry’s uncle, and that’s a long time ago.”

This was disappointing. A grandson of “old Simon’s” would surely be too
distant a relative to dispute Mary Whittaker’s title. However:

==> “That’s very interesting,” said Wimsey. “Was it the East Indies or the <==
West Indies he went to, I wonder?”

Mrs. Cobling didn’t know, but she believed it was something to do with
America.

“No, sir, in Croftover Magna, twelve miles from here. Pointer & Winkin
have his business now, but they’re young men, and I don’t know much
about them.”

==> Having by this time heard all the Coblings had to tell, Wimsey and <==
Parker gradually disentangled themselves and took their leave.

“Well, Cousin Hallelujah’s a wash-out,” said Parker.

“Possibly—possibly not. There may be some connection. Still, I certainly

Dawson had withdrawn her affairs from Mr. Probyn’s hands and had lodged
all the papers with her new solicitor. Messrs. Pointer & Winkin had
never had any connection with the Dawson family. They had no objection,
however, to furnishing Mr. Probyn’s address—Villa Bianca, Fiesole. They
regretted that they could be of no further assistance to Lord Peter
==> Wimsey and Mr. Parker. Good morning. <==

“Short and sour,” was his lordship’s comment. “Well, well—we’ll have a
spot of lunch and write a letter to Mr. Probyn and another to my good
friend Bishop Lambert of the Orinoco Mission to get a line on Cousin
Hallelujah, Smile, smile, smile. As Ingoldsby says: ‘The breezes are

Lord Peter promptly gathered up Parker and swooped down with him upon
the Tabernacle Mission, before whose dim and grim frontage Mrs. Merdle’s
long black bonnet and sweeping copper exhaust made an immense
impression. The small fry of the neighbourhood had clustered about her
==> and were practising horn solos almost before Wimsey had rung the bell. <==
On Parker’s threatening them with punishment and casually informing them
that he was a police officer, they burst into ecstasies of delight, and
joining hands, formed a ring-o’-roses round him, under the guidance of a
sprightly young woman of twelve years old or thereabouts. Parker made a
few harassed darts at them, but the ring only broke up, shrieking with

Parker shook himself free from his tormentors, and advanced, breathing
threatenings and slaughter, to which the enemy responded by a derisive
blast of the horn.

==> “They’ll run those batteries down,” said Wimsey. <==

“You can’t do anything with the little devils,” growled Parker.

“Why don’t you treat them as human beings?” retorted Wimsey. “Children
are creatures of like passions with politicians and financiers. Here,

“They’ll run those batteries down,” said Wimsey.

“You can’t do anything with the little devils,” growled Parker.

==> “Why don’t you treat them as human beings?” retorted Wimsey. “Children <==
are creatures of like passions with politicians and financiers. Here,
Esmeralda!” he added, beckoning to the ringleader.

The young woman put her tongue out and made a rude gesture, but
observing the glint of coin in the outstretched hand, suddenly

The young woman put her tongue out and made a rude gesture, but
observing the glint of coin in the outstretched hand, suddenly
approached and stood challengingly before them.

==> “Look here,” said Wimsey, “here’s half a crown—thirty pennies, you know. <==
Any use to you?”

The child promptly proved her kinship with humanity. She became abashed
in the presence of wealth, and was silent, rubbing one dusty shoe upon
the calf of her stocking.

suggestive of a railway station and hung with Old Testament prints.

“I’ll tell Mr. Dawson you’re here,” said he, and vanished, with the
volume of theology still clutched in his hand.

==> Presently a shuffling step was heard on the coconut matting, and Wimsey <==
and Parker braced themselves to confront the villainous claimant.

The door, however, opened to admit an elderly West Indian, of so humble
and inoffensive an appearance that the hearts of the two detectives sank
into their boots. Anything less murderous could scarcely be imagined, as

“Thank you. We thought you might be.”

“You do not come from Miss Whittaker?”

==> There was something eager, yet defensive in the tone. Wimsey, not quite <==
knowing what was behind it, chose the discreeter part.

“Oh, no. We are—preparin’ a work on County Families, don’t you know.
Tombstones and genealogies and that sort of thing.”

for me, showing the whole of the family. Excuse me.”

He was not gone long, and soon reappeared with a genealogy, neatly typed
out on a legal-looking sheet of blue paper.

==> Wimsey began to note down the particulars concerning Simon Dawson and <==
his son, Bosun, and his grandson, Hallelujah. Suddenly he put his finger
on an entry further along.

“Look here, Charles,” he said. “Here is our Father Paul—the bad boy who
turned R.C. and became a monk.”

“She’s a rapacious female,” agreed Parker. “Well, anyway, Father Paul’s
safely dead, and Cousin Hallelujah is illegitimately descended. So
there’s an end of the long-lost claimant from overseas.”

==> “Damn it all!” cried Wimsey, taking both hands from the steering-wheel <==
and scratching his head, to Parker’s extreme alarm, “that strikes a
familiar chord. Now where in thunder have I heard those words before?”

Parker accepted. But he noticed that, even when speaking on his beloved

worrying at the back of his mind, and even when Mr. Murbles appeared,
full of mild legal humour, Wimsey listened to him with extreme courtesy
indeed, but with only half his attention.

They were partly through dinner when, a propos of nothing, Wimsey

“Got it!” said Lord Peter.

Bunter in a low shocked voice begged his lordship’s pardon.

==> “Murbles,” said Wimsey, without heeding him, “isn’t there a new Property <==
Act?”

“Why, yes,” said Mr. Murbles, in some surprise. He had been in the
middle of a story when the interruption occurred, and was a little put
out.

“The new Act makes inheritance on intestacy very much simpler,” said Mr.
Murbles, setting his knife and fork together, placing both elbows on the
table and laying the index-finger of his right hand against his left
thumb in a gesture of tabulation.

==> “I bet it does,” interpolated Wimsey. “I know what an Act to make things <==
simpler means. It means that the people who drew it up don’t understand
it themselves and that every one of its clauses needs a law-suit to
disentangle it. But do go on.”

“Under the new Act,” pursued Mr. Murbles, “one half of the property goes

“What did I tell you?” groaned Peter. “I _knew_ this simplifying Act
would cause a shockin’ lot of muddle.”

“May I ask,” said Mr. Murbles, “exactly why you want to know all this?”

==> “Why, sir,” said Wimsey, taking from his pocket-book the genealogy of <==
the Dawson family which he had received from the Rev. Hallelujah Dawson,
“here is the point. We have always talked about Mary Whittaker as Agatha
Dawson’s niece; she was always called so and she speaks of the old lady
as her aunt. But if you look at this, you will see that actually she was
no nearer to her than great-niece: she was the grand-daughter of

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 23273    window = 23268 23278


“Quite true,” said Mr. Murbles, “but still, she was apparently the
nearest surviving relative, and since Agatha Dawson died in 1925, the
money passed without any question to Mary Whittaker under the old
Property Act. There’s no ambiguity there.”

==> “No,” said Wimsey, “none whatever, that’s the point. But—” <==

“Good God!” broke in Parker, “I see what you’re driving at. When did the
new Act come into force, sir?”

“In January, 1926,” replied Mr. Murbles.

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 23308    window = 23303 23313


“That reminds me,” put in Parker, “suppose the great-niece is excluded
from the inheritance, where does the money go?”

“It goes to the Duchy of Lancaster—or in other words, to the Crown.”

==> “In fact,” said Wimsey, “to no one in particular. Upon my soul, I really <==
can’t see that it’s very much of a crime to bump a poor old thing off a
bit previously when she’s sufferin’ horribly, just to get the money she
intends you to have. Why the devil should the Duchy of Lancaster have
it? Who cares about the Duchy of Lancaster? It’s like defrauding the
Income Tax.”

your point of view. Legally, I am afraid, murder is murder, however
frail the victim or convenient the result.”

“And Agatha Dawson didn’t want to die,” added Parker, “she said so.”

==> “No,” said Wimsey, thoughtfully, “and I suppose she had a right to an <==
opinion.”

“I think,” said Mr. Murbles, “that before we go any further, we ought to
consult a specialist in this branch of the law. I wonder whether
Towkington is at home. He is quite the ablest authority I could name.

“Towkington has some very excellent port,” said Mr. Murbles, in a
cautious aside, and clapping his hand over the mouth-piece of the
telephone.

“It’s only as far as Gray’s Inn,” continued Mr. Murbles.

“All the better,” said Lord Peter.

hospitably unsported, and almost before they could knock, Mr. Towkington
himself flung open the door and greeted them in a loud and cheerful
tone. He was a large, square man with a florid face and a harsh voice.
In court, he was famous for a way of saying, “Come now,” as a preface to
tying recalcitrant witnesses into tight knots, which he would then
==> proceed to slash open with a brilliant confutation. He knew Wimsey by <==
sight, expressed himself delighted to meet Inspector Parker, and bustled
his guests into the room with jovial shouts.

“I’ve been going into this little matter while you were coming along,”
he said. “Awkward, eh? ha! Astonishing thing that people can’t say what

he said. “Awkward, eh? ha! Astonishing thing that people can’t say what
they mean when they draw Acts, eh? ha! Why do you suppose it is, Lord
Peter, eh? ha! Come now!”

==> “I suspect it’s because Acts are drawn up by lawyers,” said Wimsey with <==
a grin.

“To make work for themselves, eh? I daresay you’re right. Even lawyers
must live, eh? ha! Very good. Well now, Murbles, let’s just have this
case again, in greater detail, d’you mind?”

“Yes,” said Mr. Murbles.

“Then I don’t see that you and your great-niece have a leg to stand
on—come now!”

==> “Excuse me,” said Wimsey, “but d’you mind—I know lay people are awful <==
ignorant nuisances—but if you _would_ be so good as to explain what the
beastly word did or does mean, it would be frightfully helpful, don’t
you know.”

“Ha! Well, it’s like this,” said Mr. Towkington, graciously. “Before

“Shrewd, very shrewd, ha!” added Mr. Towkington. “But you realise that
all this theory of yours depends on Mary Whittaker’s having known about
the new Act and its probable consequences as early as October, 1925, eh,
ha!”

==> “There’s no reason why she shouldn’t” said Wimsey. “I remember reading <==
an article in the _Evening Banner_, I think it was, some months
earlier—about the time when the Act was having its second reading.
That’s what put the thing into my head—I was trying to remember all
evening where I’d seen that thing about washing out the long-lost heir,
you know. Mary Whittaker may easily have seen it too.”

you know. Mary Whittaker may easily have seen it too.”

“Well, she’d probably have taken advice about it if she did,” said Mr.
Murbles. “Who is her usual man of affairs?”

==> Wimsey shook his head. <==

“I don’t think she’d have asked him,” he objected. “Not if she was wise,
that is. You see, if she did, and he said she probably wouldn’t get
anything unless Miss Dawson either made a will or died before January,
1926, and if after that the old lady did unexpectedly pop off in

“Probably,” said Mr. Towkington. “You show a remarkable disposition for
crime, don’t you, eh?”

“Well, if I did go in for it, I’d take reasonable precautions,” retorted
==> Wimsey. “’S wonderful, of course, the tomfool things murderers _do_ do. <==
But I have the highest opinion of Miss Whittaker’s brains. I bet she
covered her tracks pretty well.”

“You don’t think Mr. Probyn mentioned the matter,” suggested Parker,
“the time he went down and tried to get Miss Dawson to make her will.”

[line number in individual story] matching line = 5594    window = 5589 5599

covered her tracks pretty well.”

“You don’t think Mr. Probyn mentioned the matter,” suggested Parker,
“the time he went down and tried to get Miss Dawson to make her will.”

==> “I _don’t_,” said Wimsey, with energy, “but I’m pretty certain he tried <==
to explain matters to the old lady, only she was so terrified of the
very idea of a will she wouldn’t let him get a word in. But I fancy old
Probyn was too downy a bird to tell the heir that her only chance of
gettin’ the dollars was to see that her great-aunt died off before the
Act went through. Would _you_ tell anybody that, Mr. Towkington?”

“Not if I knew it,” said that gentleman, grinning.

“It would be highly undesirable,” agreed Mr. Murbles.

==> “Anyway,” said Wimsey, “we can easily find out. Probyn’s in Italy—I was <==
going to write to him, but perhaps you’d better do it, Murbles. And, in
the meanwhile, Charles and I will think up a way to find whoever it was
that did give Miss Whittaker an opinion on the matter.”

“You’re not forgetting, I suppose,” said Parker, rather dryly, “that

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 23629    window = 23624 23634



“No trouble at all.” And he named Lord Peter’s number.

Having rung off, he waited a moment and then called the number himself.

==> “Look here, Wimsey,” he said, “I’ve had a call from Mrs. Forrest. She <==
wants to write to you. I wouldn’t give the address, but I’ve given her
your number, so if she calls and asks for Mr. Templeton, you will
remember who you are, won’t you?”

“Righty-ho! Wonder what the fair lady wants.”

“Well—I felt that your inquiries were really serious, you know, and
though, as I told you, it had nothing to do with me, I was interested
and mentioned the matter in a letter to—to my friend, you see, who was
with me that night.”

==> “Just so,” said Wimsey, taking the cup from her, “yes—er—that was <==
very—er—it was kind of you to be interested.”

“He—my friend—is abroad at the moment. My letter had to follow him, and
I only got his reply to-day.”

“No,” replied Mrs. Forrest, regretfully, “but he said the man’s arm was
round the girl as though she was feeling tired or unwell, and he heard
him say, ‘That’s right—the fresh air will do you good.’ But you’re not
drinking your coffee.”

==> “I beg your pardon—” Wimsey recalled himself with a start. “I was <==
dreamin’—puttin’ two and two together, as you might say. So he was along
here at the time—the artful beggar. Oh, the coffee. D’you mind if I put
this away and have some without sugar?”

“I’m _so_ sorry. Men always seem to take sugar in black coffee. Give it

this away and have some without sugar?”

“I’m _so_ sorry. Men always seem to take sugar in black coffee. Give it
to me—I’ll empty it away.”

==> “Allow me.” There was no slop-basin on the little table, but Wimsey <==
quickly got up and poured the coffee into the window-box outside.
“That’s all right. How about another cup for you?”

“Thank you—I oughtn’t to take it really, it keeps me awake.”

“Oh, well, if you like.” She filled both cups and sat sipping quietly.
“Well—that’s all, really, but I thought perhaps I ought to let you
know.”

==> “It was very good of you,” said Wimsey. <==

They sat talking a little longer—about plays in Town (“I go out very
little, you know, it’s better to keep oneself out of the limelight on
these occasions”), and books (“I adore Michael Arlen”). Had she read
_Young Men in Love_ yet? No—she had ordered it from the library.

getting the range. . .

Suddenly he became aware that she was trying—clumsily, stupidly and as
though in spite of herself—to get him to make love to her.

==> The fact itself did not strike Wimsey as odd. He was rich enough, <==
well-bred enough, attractive enough and man of the world enough to have
received similar invitations fairly often in his thirty-seven years of
life. And not always from experienced women. There had been those who
sought experience as well as those qualified to bestow it. But so
awkward an approach by a woman who admitted to already possessing a

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 23880    window = 23875 23885


Moreover, he felt that the thing would be a nuisance. Mrs. Forrest was
handsome enough, but she had not a particle of attraction for him. For
all her make-up and her somewhat outspoken costume, she struck him as
spinsterish—even epicene. That was the thing which puzzled him during
their previous interview. Parker—a young man of rigid virtue and limited
==> worldly knowledge—was not sensitive to these emanations. But Wimsey had <==
felt her as something essentially sexless, even then. And he felt it
even more strongly now. Never had he met a woman in whom “the great It,”
eloquently hymned by Mrs. Elinor Glyn, was so completely lacking.

Her bare shoulder was against him now, marking his broadcloth with white

[line number in individual story] matching line = 5960    window = 5955 5965

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 23893    window = 23888 23898


Blackmail was the first explanation that occurred to him. The next move
would be for the fabulous Mr. Forrest, or someone representing him, to
appear suddenly in the doorway, aglow with virtuous wrath and outraged
sensibilities.

==> “A very pretty little trap,” thought Wimsey, adding aloud, “Well, I <==
really must be getting along.”

She caught him by the arm.

“Don’t go.”

A passionate woman might have said it passionately. Or with a brave
gaiety. Or challengingly. Or alluringly. Or mysteriously.

She said it grimly. Her fingers dug at his arm.

==> “Well, damn it all, _I’ll_ risk it,” thought Wimsey. “I must and will <==
know what it’s all about.”

“Poor little woman.” He coaxed into his voice the throaty, fatuous tone
of the man who is preparing to make an amorous fool of himself.

“You are really going?”

She spoke as though she had lost all hope.

==> “In God’s name,” thought Wimsey, “what does she want? Does she suspect <==
that Mr. Templeton is not everything that he seems? Does she want me to
stay the night so that she can get a look at the laundry-mark on my
shirt? Should I suddenly save the situation for her by offering her Lord
Peter Wimsey’s visiting-card?”

His brain toyed freakishly with the thought as he babbled his way to the
door. She let him go without further words.

As he stepped into the hall he turned and looked at her. She stood in

his soul sickened at the sight of a brass plate. He glanced at the long
list in his hand, and distastefully counted up the scores of names that
still remained unticked.

Parker was one of those methodical, painstaking people whom the world

understood thing that anything lengthy, intricate, tedious and
soul-destroying was done by Parker. He sometimes felt that it was

“I deny nothing,” replied Parker. “I will only point out to you that
during the month in which these disasters occurred to the Gotobed
family, the object of your suspicions was in Kent with Miss Vera
Findlater, who never left her side.”

==> “As against that undoubted snag,” rejoined Wimsey, “I bring forward a <==
letter from Miss Climpson, in which—amid a lot of rigmarole with which I
will not trouble you—she informs me that upon Miss Whittaker’s right
hand there is a scar, precisely similar to the one which Mr. Trigg
describes.”

applause. His chin sank broodingly upon his dressing-gown, and he
breathed a few guttural notes into the bass saxophone which was the
cherished companion of his solitary hours in the bathroom.”

Parker ostentatiously took up the book which he had laid aside on

“Tell me when you’ve finished,” he said, caustically.

“I’ve hardly begun. The means, I repeat, seems insoluble—and so the
criminal evidently thinks. There has been no exaggerated mortality among

test won’t tell you whether strychnine is present or not. And if you’re
testing for strychnine, you won’t find morphia. You’ve got to try one
test after another till you hit the right one. And of course there are
certain poisons for which no recognised tests exist.”

==> “I know all that,” said Wimsey. “I’ve tested things myself. But these <==
poisons with no recognised test—how do you set about proving that
they’re there?”

“Well, of course, you’d take the symptoms into account, and so on. You
would look at the history of the case.”

sounds reminiscent, somehow.”

Parker, who was out of temper, replied rather shortly, and intimated
that the police car would be starting for Leahampton in an hour’s time.

==> “I will be there,” said Wimsey, “though, mind you, I hate being driven <==
by another fellow. It feels so unsafe. Never mind. I will be bloody,
bold and resolute, as Queen Victoria said to the Archbishop of
Canterbury.”

put inquiries through to all the ports, of course. With four days’
start, they may be anywhere by now. I wish to Heaven I’d risked a bit
and started earlier, approval or no approval. What’s this Findlater girl
like? I’d better go back to the house and get photographs of her and the

see if she has any information.”

“And you might tell ’em at the Yard to keep an eye on Mrs. Forrest’s

it’s a good tip to watch the accomplice.”

as good and nice a girl as you could wish to find. But there has
undoubtedly been an accident of some kind, and it is our duty to make
the fullest investigation. I will get on to Crow’s Beach police
immediately, as soon as I know the description of the car.”

==> “It’s an Austin Seven and the number is XX9917,” said Wimsey, much to <==
the Chief Constable’s surprise. “But I doubt very much whether you’ll
find it at Crow’s Beach, or anywhere near it.”

“Well, we’d better get a move on,” snapped Parker. “We’d better
separate. How about a spot of lunch in an hour’s time at the George?”

[line number in individual story] matching line = 7442    window = 7437 7447

“Well, we’d better get a move on,” snapped Parker. “We’d better
separate. How about a spot of lunch in an hour’s time at the George?”

==> Wimsey was unlucky. Miss Climpson was not to be found. She had had her <==
lunch early and gone out, saying she felt that a long country walk would
do her good. Mrs. Budge was rather afraid she had had some bad news—she
had seemed so upset and worried since yesterday evening.

“But indeed, sir,” she added, “if you was quick, you might find her up

moment, however, he felt he could not afford time for religious
discussion, and set off for the church in quest of Miss Climpson.

The doors of S. Onesimus were hospitably open, and the red Sanctuary
lamp made a little spot of welcoming brightness in the rather dark
==> building. Coming in from the June sunshine, Wimsey blinked a little <==
before he could distinguish anything else. Presently he was able to make
out a dark, bowed figure kneeling before the lamp. For a moment he hoped
it was Miss Climpson, but presently saw to his disappointment that it
was merely a Sister in a black habit, presumably taking her turn to
watch before the Host. The only other occupant of the church was a

out a dark, bowed figure kneeling before the lamp. For a moment he hoped
it was Miss Climpson, but presently saw to his disappointment that it
was merely a Sister in a black habit, presumably taking her turn to
watch before the Host. The only other occupant of the church was a
priest in a cassock, who was busy with the ornaments on the High Altar.
==> It was the Feast of S. John, Wimsey remembered suddenly. He walked up <==
the aisle, hoping to find his quarry hidden in some obscure corner. His
shoes squeaked. This annoyed him. It was a thing which Bunter never
permitted. He was seized with a fancy that the squeak was produced by
diabolic possession—a protest against a religious atmosphere on the part
of his own particular besetting devil. Pleased with this thought, he

diabolic possession—a protest against a religious atmosphere on the part
of his own particular besetting devil. Pleased with this thought, he
moved forward more confidently.

The priest’s attention was attracted by the squeak. He turned and came
==> down towards the intruder. No doubt, thought Wimsey, to offer his <==
professional services to exorcise the evil spirit.

“Were you looking for anybody?” inquired the priest, courteously.

“Well, I was looking for a lady,” began Wimsey. Then it struck him that

down towards the intruder. No doubt, thought Wimsey, to offer his
professional services to exorcise the evil spirit.

“Were you looking for anybody?” inquired the priest, courteously.

==> “Well, I was looking for a lady,” began Wimsey. Then it struck him that <==
this sounded a little odd under the circumstances, and he hastened to
explain more fully, in the stifled tones considered appropriate to
consecrated surroundings.

“Oh, yes,” said the priest, quite unperturbed, “Miss Climpson was here a

little time ago, but I fancy she has gone. Not that I usually keep tabs
on my flock,” he added, with a laugh, “but she spoke to me before she
went. Was it urgent? What a pity you should have missed her. Can I give
any kind of message or help you in any way?”

==> “No, thanks,” said Wimsey. “Sorry to bother you. Unseemly to come and <==
try to haul people out of church, but—yes, it was rather important. I’ll
leave a message at the house. Thanks frightfully.”

He turned away; then stopped and came back.

“Well, we’re supposed to try,” said the priest. “Is anything bothering
you in particular?”

==> “Ye-es,” said Wimsey, “nothing religious, I don’t mean—nothing about <==
infallibility or the Virgin Mary or anything of that sort. Just
something I’m not comfortable about.”

The priest—who was, in fact, the vicar, Mr. Tredgold—indicated that he
was quite at Lord Peter’s service.

“Let’s go outside,” said Mr. Tredgold.

So they went out and sat on a flat tombstone.

anyhow. And they’re in awful pain and all that, and kept under

who knew all that was just to give ’em a little push off so to
speak—hurry matters on—why should that be a very dreadful crime?”

“The law—” began Mr. Tredgold.

==> “Oh, the law says it’s a crime, fast enough,” said Wimsey. “But do you <==
honestly think it’s very bad? I know you’d call it a sin, of course, but
why is it so very dreadful? It doesn’t do the person any harm, does it?”

“We can’t answer that,” said Mr. Tredgold, “without knowing the ways of
God with the soul. In those last weeks or hours of pain and

over again.”

“I shouldn’t be too troubled. Probably the murderer’s own guilty fears
would have led him into fresh crimes even without your interference.”

==> “That’s true,” said Wimsey, remembering Mr. Trigg. <==

“My advice to you is to do what you think is right, according to the
laws which we have been brought up to respect. Leave the consequences to
God. And try to think charitably, even of wicked people. You know what I
mean. Bring the offender to justice, but remember that if we all got

and the Chief Constable, who was vindicated and triumphant. He had been
telephoning to various country police-stations, and had discovered that
XX9917 had actually been observed on the previous Monday by an A.A.
scout on the road to Crow’s Beach. Having maintained all along that the
Crow’s Beach excursion was a genuine one, he was inclined to exult over
==> the Scotland Yard man. Wimsey and Parker dispiritedly agreed that they <==
had better go down and make inquiries at Crow’s Beach.

Meanwhile, one of the photographers, whose cousin was on the staff of
the _Leahampton Mercury_, had put a call through to the office of that
up-to-date paper, which was just going to press. A stop-press

hiding a small car, not to speak of the mere signs and remains of a
recent picnic. Having arrived at what their guide thought to be
approximately the right place, they pulled up and got out. Parker
quartered the ground between the five of them and they set off.

them and so thick. Any of them might hold a cigarette package or a
sandwich paper or a scrap of cloth or a clue of some kind. He trudged
along unhappily, back bent and eyes on the ground, over one ridge and
down into the hollow—then circling to right and to left, taking his
bearings by the police-car; over the next ridge and down into the next

A small black figure at some distance stopped and turned. He saw its
face as a white spot with no expression on it. He shouted again, and
waved his arms in wide gestures of explanation. The figure came running;
it lurched slowly and awkwardly over the heathy ground. It was the

again, and the policeman shouted too. Wimsey saw the others closing in
upon him. The grotesque figure of the boy-scout topped a ridge, waving
its staff—then disappeared again. The policeman was quite near now. His

A small black figure at some distance stopped and turned. He saw its
face as a white spot with no expression on it. He shouted again, and
waved his arms in wide gestures of explanation. The figure came running;
it lurched slowly and awkwardly over the heathy ground. It was the
policeman—a heavy man, not built for running in the heat. Wimsey shouted

upon him. The grotesque figure of the boy-scout topped a ridge, waving
its staff—then disappeared again. The policeman was quite near now. His
bowler hat was thrust back on his head, and there was something on his
watch-chain that glinted in the sun as he ran. Wimsey found himself
running to meet him and calling—explaining at great length. It was too

came together. They were both breathless. They wagged their heads and
gasped. It was ludicrous. He started running again, with the man at his

tired.

“Peter,” said Parker’s voice, “come and look at this.”

He got up wearily.

the ground, close to the dead girl’s head, was a thick, heavy
spanner—unpleasantly discoloured and with a few fair hairs sticking to
its jaws. But what Parker was calling his attention to was none of
these, but a man’s mauve-grey cap.

==> “Where did you find that?” asked Wimsey. <==

“Alf here picked it up at the top of the hollow,” said Parker.

“Tumbled off into the gorse it was,” corroborated the scout, “just up
here, lying upside down just as if it had fallen off somebody’s head.”

to the right and work through from the other end, while I go straight up
the middle?”

The Chief Constable, who seemed a good deal shaken by the discovery of
==> the body, obeyed without a word. Wimsey caught Parker by the arm. <==

“I say,” he said, “have you looked at the wound? Something funny, isn’t
there? There ought to be more mess, somehow. What do you think?”

“I’m not thinking anything for the moment,” said Parker, a little

through the trees. Parker followed it for a little distance, but the
tracks soon became lost in a thick carpet of pine-needles. Still, there
was no other road for a car to take. He turned to the Austin to
investigate further. Presently shouts told him that the other two were
converging upon the centre of the wood. He called back and before long

“Light reading for the masses,” said Parker.

“Brought by the gentleman in the yellow boots, perhaps,” suggested the
Chief Constable.

==> “More likely by Miss Findlater,” said Wimsey. <==

“Hardly a lady’s choice,” said Sir Charles, in a pained tone.

“Oh, I dunno. From all I hear, Miss Whittaker was dead against
sentimentality and roses round the porch, and the other poor girl copied

“Well, it’s not important,” said Parker.

“Wait a bit. Look at this. Somebody’s been making marks on it.”

==> Wimsey held out the cover for inspection. A thick pencil-mark had been <==
drawn under the first two words of the title.

“Do you think it’s some sort of message? Perhaps the book was on the
seat, and she contrived to make the marks unnoticed and shove it away
here before they transferred her to the other car.”

They turned from the translucent cool greenness of the little wood back
on to the downs. The streamlet clacked merrily away over the pebbles,
running out to the southwest on its way to the river and the sea.

can’t you say what you’ve seen?”

impatiently called a “Tutster.” He tutted over the mangled head of poor
Vera Findlater as though it was an attack of measles after a party or a
self-provoked fit of the gout.

“Tst, tst, tst. A terrible blow. How did we come by that, I wonder? Tst,

chloroform—medical pronouncements of that kind cannot be hastily made
without cautious investigation—but I was about to remark that it _might_
be.”

the chloroform? Supposing she was given too much or that her heart was
weak?”

“My good sir,” said the doctor, deeply offended this time, “look at that

“My good sir,” said the doctor, deeply offended this time, “look at that
blow upon the head, and ask yourself whether it is necessary to suggest
any other cause of death. Moreover, if she had died of the chloroform,
where would be the necessity for the blow?”

“I suppose,” went on the doctor, “you will hardly dispute my medical
knowledge?”

“Certainly not,” said Wimsey, “but as you say, it is unwise to make any

“And this is not the place for it,” put in Parker, hastily. “I think we
have done all there is to do here. Will you go with the body to the
mortuary, doctor. Mr. Andrews, I shall be obliged if you will come and

have done all there is to do here. Will you go with the body to the
mortuary, doctor. Mr. Andrews, I shall be obliged if you will come and
take a few photographs of some footmarks and so on up in the wood. The
light is bad, I’m afraid, but we must do our best.”

==> He took Wimsey by the arm. <==

“The man is a fool, of course,” he said, “but we can get a second
opinion. In the meantime, we had better let it be supposed that we
accept the surface explanation of all this.”

rather remarkable—”

“And this is where we found the body of Miss Findlater,” went on Parker,
ruthlessly. He described the injuries and the position of the body, and
the journalist gratefully occupied himself with taking photographs,
==> including a group of Wimsey, Parker and the Chief Constable standing <==
among the gorse-bushes, while the latter majestically indicated the
fatal spot with his walking-stick.

“And now you’ve got what you want, old son,” said Parker, benevolently,
“buzz off, won’t you, and tell the rest of the boys. You’ve got all we

unthinkably sinister, by a black man—aroused all the passion of horror
and indignation of which the English temperament is capable. Reporters
swarmed down upon Crow’s Beach like locusts—the downs near Shelly Head
were like a fair with motors, bicycles and parties on foot, rushing out
to spend a happy week-end amid surroundings of mystery and bloodshed.

the telephone and receiving the letters and wires which descended upon
him from all sides, with a stalwart policeman posted at the end of the
passage to keep out all intruders.

“When a woman is wicked and unscrupulous,” said Parker, sententiously,
“she is the most ruthless criminal in the world—fifty times worse than a
man, because she is always so much more single-minded about it.”

==> “They’re not troubled with sentimentality, that’s why,” said Wimsey, <==
“and we poor mutts of men stuff ourselves up with the idea that they’re
romantic and emotional. All punk, my son. Damn that ’phone!”

Parker snatched up the receiver.

“Do you think it was administered at all?”

“Yes, I think it was. The burns on the face certainly suggest it.”

“That would also account for the handkerchief found in the car,” said

“I suppose,” pursued Parker, “that it would require considerable
strength and determination to administer chloroform to a strong young
woman. She would probably resist strenuously.”

woman. She would probably resist strenuously.”

“She would,” said the doctor, grimly, “But the odd thing is, she didn’t.
As I said before, all the marks of violence were inflicted post-mortem.”

==> “Suppose she had been asleep at the time,” suggested Wimsey, “couldn’t <==
it have been done quietly then?”

“Oh, yes—easily. After a few long breaths of the stuff she would become
semi-conscious and then could be more firmly dealt with. It is quite
possible, I suppose, that she fell asleep in the sunshine, while her

“I’m not a talker,” said the doctor. “Gang you call it, and gang it is,
as far as I’m concerned. And Miss Findlater was hit on the head and died
of it. I only hope my colleague and the Chief Constable will be equally
discreet. I warned them, naturally, after what you said last night.”

==> “It’s all very well,” said Wimsey, “but what positive evidence have we, <==
after all, against this woman? A clever defending counsel would tear the
whole thing to rags. The only thing we can absolutely _prove_ her to
have done is the burgling that house on Hampstead Heath and stealing the
coal. The other deaths were returned natural deaths at the inquest. And
as for Miss Findlater—even if we show it to be chloroform—well,

handwriting, and it “came over her like a flash”—as she explained
afterwards, exactly what the implication of the words was.

For a full half-hour Miss Climpson sat alone, struggling with her
conscience. Her natural inquisitiveness said “Read”; her religious
==> training said, “You must not read”; her sense of duty to Wimsey, who <==
employed her, said, “Find out”; her own sense of decency said, “Do no
such thing”; a dreadful, harsh voice muttered gratingly, “Murder is the
question. Are you going to be the accomplice of Murder?” She felt like
Lancelot Gobbo between conscience and the fiend—but which was the fiend
and which was conscience?

forget it, to the end of her life. She would always carry with her that
grim suspicion. She would think of Mary Whittaker as—perhaps—a
Murderess. When she looked into those hard blue eyes, she would be
wondering what sort of expression they had when the soul behind them was
plotting—MURDER. Of course, the suspicions had been there before,
==> planted by Wimsey, but now they were her own suspicions. They <==
crystallised—became real to her.

“What shall I do?”

She gave a quick, shamefaced glance at the paper again. This time she

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 26689    window = 26684 26694


be hoped there wasn’t an accident.”

And into Miss Climpson’s mind there came, like an inspiration, the
words, “South Audley Street.”

==> Miss Climpson did not, of course, know that Wimsey was at Crow’s Beach. <==
She hoped to find him in Town. For she was seized with a desire, which
she could hardly have explained even to herself, to go and look at South
Audley Street. What she was to do when she got there she did not know,
but go there she must. It was the old reluctance to make open use of
that confession paper. Vera Findlater’s story at first hand—that was the

she could hardly have explained even to herself, to go and look at South
Audley Street. What she was to do when she got there she did not know,
but go there she must. It was the old reluctance to make open use of
that confession paper. Vera Findlater’s story at first hand—that was the
idea to which she obscurely clung. So she took the first train to
==> Waterloo, leaving behind her, in case Wimsey or Parker should call <==
again, a letter so obscure and mysterious and so lavishly underlined and
interlined that it was perhaps fortunate for their reason that they were
never faced with it.

In Piccadilly she saw Bunter, and learned that his lordship was at

story of Vera Findlater’s death.


Sunday was the most awful day Miss Climpson had ever spent. An active
woman, she was condemned to inactivity, and she had time to brood over
==> the tragedy. Not having Wimsey’s or Parker’s inside knowledge, she took <==
the kidnapping story at its face value. In a sense, she found it
comforting, for she was able to acquit Mary Whittaker of any share in
this or the previous murders. She put them down—except, of course, in
the case of Miss Dawson, and that might never have been a murder after
all—to the mysterious man in South Audley Street. She formed a nightmare

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 26804    window = 26799 26809


Climpson’s credit be it said that she never for one moment faltered in
her determination to track the monster to his lurking-place.

She wrote a long letter to Lord Peter, detailing her plans. Bunter, she
knew, had left 110A Piccadilly, so, after considerable thought, she
==> addressed it to Lord Peter Wimsey, c/o Inspector Parker, The <==
Police-Station, Crow’s Beach. There was, of course, no Sunday post from
Town. However, it would go with the midnight collection.

On the Monday morning she set out early, in her old clothes and her
spectacles, for South Audley Street. Never had her natural

cheque had come back, like the bad penny that it was. A forgery. Miss
Climpson had had to give evidence. She remembered now the odd, defiant
look with which the young man had taken up his pen for his first plunge
into crime. And to-day she was seeing it again—an unattractive mingling
of recklessness and calculation. It was with the look which had once
==> warned Wimsey and should have warned her. She breathed more quickly. <==

“Who was the man?”

“The man?” Mary Whittaker laughed suddenly. “A man called Templeton—no
friend of mine. It’s really funny that you should think he was a friend

activity was displayed in the neighbourhood of the downs, and at
Southampton and Portsmouth, in order to foster the idea that the
authorities supposed the “gang” to be lurking in those districts.
Nothing, as a matter of fact, was farther from Parker’s thoughts. “Let
her think she is safe,” he said, “and she’ll come back. It’s the
==> cat-and-mouse act for us, old man.” Wimsey fretted. He wanted the <==
analysis of the body to be complete and loathed the thought of the long
days he had to wait. And he had small hope of the result.

“It’s all very well sitting round with your large disguised policemen
outside Mrs. Forrest’s flat,” he said irritably, over the bacon and eggs

on Monday morning, “but you do realise, don’t you, that we’ve still got
no proof of murder. Not in one single case.”

“That’s so,” replied Parker, placidly.

==> “Well, doesn’t it make your blood boil?” said Wimsey. <==

“Hardly,” said Parker. “This kind of thing happens too often. If my
blood boiled every time there was a delay in getting evidence, I should
be in a perpetual fever. Why worry? It may be that perfect crime you’re
so fond of talking about—the one that leaves no trace. You ought to be

these elaborate efforts to cover it up?”

“It wasn’t,” said Parker; “the proof being that—as we now know—the plot
was laid nearly two months ago.”

==> “But the method!” cried Wimsey, “the method! Hang it all—here are all we <==
people with our brilliant brains and our professional reputations—and
this half-trained girl out of a hospital can beat the lot of us. How was
it done?”

“It’s probably something so simple and obvious that it’s never occurred

fourth form and never apply to anything. Rudimentary. Like that
motor-cycling imbecile we met up at Crofton, who sat in the rain and
prayed for help because he’d never heard of an air-lock in his feed. Now
I daresay that boy had learnt—What’s the matter with you?”

things, upsetting his cup. “My God! But that’s it! You’ve got it—you’ve

could have told you. People die of it every day. Of course, it was an

air-lock in the feed.”

“Bear up, doctor,” said Parker, “he’s always like this when he gets an
idea. It wears off in time. D’you mind explaining yourself, old thing?”

==> Wimsey’s pallid face was flushed. He turned on the doctor. <==

“Look here,” he said, “the body’s a pumping engine, isn’t it? The jolly
old heart pumps the blood round the arteries and back through the veins
and so on, doesn’t it? That’s what keeps things working, what? Round and

Lord Peter came on. And that, as Dr. Faulkner would say, was why Miss

to catch him.

wheel—and went straight to Scotland Yard, dropping Bunter, at his own
request, as he was anxious to return to the flat. They found the Chief
Commissioner in rather a brusque mood—angry with the _Banner_ and
annoyed with Parker for having failed to muzzle Pillington.

annoyed with Parker for having failed to muzzle Pillington.

“God knows where she will be found next. She’s probably got a disguise
and a get-away all ready.”

==> “Probably gone already,” said Wimsey. “She could easily have left <==
England on the Monday or Tuesday and nobody a penny the wiser. If the
coast had seemed clear, she’d have come back and taken possession of her
goods again. Now she’ll stay abroad. That’s all.”

“I’m very much afraid you’re right,” agreed Parker, gloomily.

to shadow her away from the flat have watched carefully to see if she
speaks to anyone or slips money to anyone. We’re pretty sure the two
haven’t met yet.”

“Excuse me, sir.” An officer put his head in at the door. “Here’s Lord
==> Peter Wimsey’s man, sir, with an urgent message.” <==

Bunter entered, trimly correct in bearing, but with a glitter in his
eye. He laid down two photographs on the table.

“Excuse me, my lord and gentlemen, but would you be so good as to cast

Dewsby was the head of the fingerprint department, and he had no
hesitation at all.

“They are undoubtedly the same prints,” he said.

==> A light was slowly breaking in on Wimsey. <==

“Bunter—did these come off that wine-glass?”

“Yes, my lord.”

“There was,” said Parker, grimly, “but the witness was the girl that’s
just been murdered. Looks as though she had made up her mind to split
and was got rid of.”

“Looks as though several people had had a near squeak of it,” said
==> Wimsey. <==

“Including you. That yellow hair was a wig, then.”

“Probably. It never looked natural, you know. When I was there that
night she had on one of those close turban affairs—she might have been

“That being so,” said the Chief Commissioner, “the sooner we get hold of
her the better. You’d better go at once, Inspector; take a warrant for
Whittaker or Forrest—and any help you may require.”

==> “May I come?” asked Wimsey, when they were outside the building. <==

“Why not? You may be useful. With the men we’ve got there already we
shan’t need any extra help.”

The car whizzed swiftly through Pall Mall, up St. James’s Street and

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 27359    window = 27354 27364


“That’s right. Went straight to the door and started something about a
subscription. Then Mrs. Forrest pulled her in quick and slammed the
door. Nobody’s come down since.”

“Right. We’ll take ourselves up—and mind you don’t let anybody give us
==> the slip by the staircase. Now then, Wimsey, she knows you as Templeton, <==
but she may still not know for certain that you’re working with us. Ring
the bell, and when the door’s opened, stick your foot inside. We’ll
stand just round the corner here and be ready to rush.”

This manœuvre was executed. They heard the bell trill loudly.

the bell, and when the door’s opened, stick your foot inside. We’ll
stand just round the corner here and be ready to rush.”

This manœuvre was executed. They heard the bell trill loudly.

==> Nobody came to answer it, however. Wimsey rang again, and then bent his <==
ear to the door.

“Charles,” he cried suddenly, “there’s something going on here.” His
face was white. “Be quick! I couldn’t stand _another_—!”

And all the time, a horrid, stealthy thumping and gurgling sounded
inside—dragging of something heavy and a scuffling noise. Then a loud
crash, as though a piece of furniture had been flung to the floor—and
then a loud hoarse scream, cut brutally off in the middle.

==> “Break in the door,” said Wimsey, the sweat pouring down his face. <==

Parker signalled to the heavier of the two policemen. He came along,
shoulder first, lunging. The door shook and cracked. They stamped and
panted in the narrow space.

“Oh, quick!” sobbed Peter.

A door on the right stood open. A glance assured them that there was
nothing there. They sprang to the sitting-room door and pushed it. It
opened about a foot. Something bulky impeded its progress. They shoved
==> violently and the obstacle gave. Wimsey leapt over it—it was a tall <==
cabinet, fallen, with broken china strewing the floor. The room bore
signs of a violent struggle—tables flung down, a broken chair, a smashed
lamp. He dashed for the bedroom, with Parker hard at his heels.

The body of a woman lay limply on the bed. Her long, grizzled hair hung

signs of a violent struggle—tables flung down, a broken chair, a smashed
lamp. He dashed for the bedroom, with Parker hard at his heels.

The body of a woman lay limply on the bed. Her long, grizzled hair hung
in a dark rope over the pillow and blood was on her head and throat. But
==> the blood was running freely, and Wimsey could have shouted for joy at <==
the sight. Dead men do not bleed.

Parker gave only one glance at the injured woman. He made promptly for
the dressing-room beyond. A shot sang past his head—there was a snarl
and a shriek—and the episode was over. The constable stood shaking his

He was anxiously sponging her head as he spoke, and at that moment her
eyes opened.

“Help!” said Miss Climpson, confusedly. “The syringe—you shan’t—oh!” She
==> struggled feebly, and then recognised Wimsey’s anxious face. “Oh, dear!” <==
she exclaimed, “Lord Peter. Such an upset. Did you get my letter? Is it
all right? . . . Oh, dear! What a state I’m in. I—that woman—”

“Now, don’t worry, Miss Climpson,” said Wimsey, much relieved,

about it later.”

“What was that about a syringe?” said Parker, intent on his case.

“She’s mental, that’s what she is,” said the prisoner. “That’s only the
hypodermic I use for my injections when I get neuralgia. There’s nothing
in that.”

==> “That is quite correct,” said Parker, with a significant nod at Wimsey. <==
“There is—nothing in it.”

On the Tuesday night, when the prisoner had been committed for trial on
the charges of murdering Bertha Gotobed and Vera Findlater, and
==> attempting to murder Alexandra Climpson, Wimsey dined with Parker. The <==
former was depressed and nervous.

“The whole thing’s been beastly,” he grumbled. They had sat up
discussing the case into the small hours.

“No. Unless she wills it to someone, it will go to the Whittaker
next-of-kin—a first cousin, I believe, called Allcock. A very decent
fellow, living in Birmingham. That is,” he added, assailed by sudden
doubt, “if first cousins _do_ inherit under this confounded Act.”

==> “Oh, I think first cousins are safe,” said Wimsey, “though nothing seems <==
safe nowadays. Still, dash it all, some relations must still be allowed
a look-in, or what becomes of the sanctity of family life? If so, that’s
the most cheering thing about the beastly business. Do you know, when I
rang up that man Carr and told him all about it, he wasn’t a bit
interested or grateful. Said he’d always suspected something like that,

“I never did like that man. I’m sorry for Nurse Philliter.”

“You needn’t be. I put my foot in it again over that. Carr’s too grand
to marry a nurse now—at least, I fancy that’s what it is. Anyway, the
engagement’s off. And I was so pleased at the idea of playing Providence
==> to two deserving young people,” added Wimsey, pathetically. <==

“Dear, dear! Well, the girl’s well out of it. Hullo! there’s the ’phone.
Who on earth—? Some damned thing at the Yard, I suppose. At three ack
emma! Who’d be a policeman?—Yes?—Oh!—right, I’ll come round. The case
has gone west, Peter.”

“An evil woman, if ever there was one,” said Parker, softly, as they
looked at the rigid body, with its swollen face and the deeper, red ring
about the throat.

==> Wimsey said nothing. He felt cold and sick. While Parker and the <==
Governor of the prison made the necessary arrangements and discussed the
case, he sat hunched unhappily upon his chair. Their voices went on and
on interminably. Six o’clock had struck some time before they rose to
go. It reminded him of the eight strokes of the clock which announce the
running-up of the black and hideous flag.

As the gate clanged open to let them out, they stepped into a wan and
awful darkness. The June day had risen long ago, but only a pale and
yellowish gleam lit the half-deserted streets. And it was bitterly cold
and raining.

==> “What is the matter with the day?” said Wimsey. “Is the world coming to <==
an end?”

“No,” said Parker, “it is the eclipse.”

“No, I suppose not. Still, I think there’s something in the idea that

“Yes—and whichever way it was, it probably wasn’t legal murder in that

Lord Peter paused, in the very act of ringing the bell. His jaw
slackened, giving his long, narrow face a faintly foolish and hesitant
look, reminiscent of the heroes of Mr. P. G. Wodehouse.

“You don’t think—” he began. “Oh! rats!” He pressed the button. “It

The advertisement made its first appearance on the Tuesday morning.

“Yes, I’ve got a new theory of the crime, which knocks yours into a

“Yes—shock, perhaps, or a shot of dope.”

the hatless lady under cover of his raised elbows. But the result was
disappointing. Mrs. Cropper had never seen the lady before, and a
further promenade from end to end of the train produced no better
results.

==> “We must leave it to Bunter, then,” said his lordship, cheerfully, as <==
they returned to their seats. “I put him on the trail as soon as you
gave me the good word. Now, Mrs. Cropper, we really get down to
business. First of all, we should be glad of any suggestions you may
have to make about your sister’s death. We don’t want to distress you,

Lord Peter took Mrs. Cropper down to Christchurch and returned to town
to have a conference with Mr. Parker. The latter had just listened to
his recital of Mrs. Cropper’s story, when the discreet opening and

“Any luck?” inquired Wimsey.

“I regret exceedingly to have to inform your lordship that I lost track

expression, I was completely done in the eye.”

==> “Thank God, Bunter, you’re human after all. I didn’t know anybody could <==
do you. Have a drink.”

“I am much obliged to your lordship. According to instructions, I
searched the platform for a lady in a crimson hat and a grey fur, and at
length was fortunate enough to observe her making her way out by the

quarters of an hour, but the crimson hat did not reappear. Your lordship
will bear in mind that I had never seen the lady’s face.”

Lord Peter groaned.

==> “I foresee the end of this story, Bunter. Not your fault. Proceed.” <==

“At the end of this time, my lord, I felt bound to conclude either that
the lady had been taken ill or that something untoward had occurred. I
summoned a female attendant who happened to cross the hall and informed
her that I had been entrusted with a message for a lady whose dress I

described. I begged her to ascertain from the attendant in the Ladies’
Room whether the lady in question was still there. The girl went away
and presently returned to say that the lady had changed her costume in
the cloak-room and had gone out half an hour previously.”

==> “Oh, Bunter, Bunter. Didn’t you spot the suitcase or whatever it was <==
when she came out again?”

“Excuse me, my lord. The lady had come in earlier in the day and had
left an attaché-case in charge of the attendant. On returning, she had
transferred her hat and fur to the attaché-case and put on a small black

“I thank your lordship, but I slept excellently in the train on the way
up.”

other people.”

Bunter smiled discreetly and withdrew.

“Well, we’ve gained this much, anyhow,” said Parker. “We know now that

“Just as you like, Bunter. But I did hope you sometimes got tired like

precautions to avoid being followed.”

night, “Mrs. Merdle” purred her way delicately round hedge-blinded
corners and down devious lanes, her quest made no easier by the fact
that the Warwick County Council had pitched upon that particular week
for a grand repainting of signposts and had reached the preliminary
stage of laying a couple of thick coats of gleaming white paint over all

back seat and climbed one of these uncommunicative guides to peer at its
blank surface with a torch—a process which reminded Parker of Alan
Quartermain trying to trace the features of the departed Kings of the
Kukuanas under their calcareous shrouds of stalactite. One of the posts
turned out to be in the wet-paint stage, which added to the depression

“It’s starting to rain,” observed Parker, conversationally.

“Look here, Charles, if you’re going to bear up cheerfully and be the
life and soul of the expedition, say so and have done with it. I’ve got

the body.”

“I think this must be Brushwood Cross,” resumed Parker, who had the map
on his knee. “If so, and if it’s not Covert Corner, which I thought we
passed half an hour ago, one of those roads leads directly to Crofton.”

“Where are you dining?”

bloody steak and there are new peas and potatoes and genuine English
grass. Gerald sent it up from Denver specially. You can’t buy it. Come

full of mild legal humour, Wimsey listened to him with extreme courtesy
indeed, but with only half his attention.

They were partly through dinner when, a propos of nothing, Wimsey
suddenly brought his fist down on the mahogany with a crash that

Haut Brion over the edge of the glass upon the tablecloth.

“Got it!” said Lord Peter.

Bunter in a low shocked voice begged his lordship’s pardon.

“Got it!” said Lord Peter.

“Murbles,” said Wimsey, without heeding him, “isn’t there a new Property

“Why, yes,” said Mr. Murbles, in some surprise. He had been in the

Mr. Templeton chivalrously promised to obey these directions.

Mrs. Forrest was greatly obliged, and would expect him at nine o’clock.

House of Lords made the gesture of stooping to conquer.

Meanwhile, Lord Peter’s projected _magnum opus_ on a-hundred-and-one
ways of causing sudden death had advanced by the accumulation of a mass
of notes which flowed all over the library at the flat, and threatened
==> to engulf Bunter, whose task it was to file and cross-reference and <==
generally to produce order from chaos. Oriental scholars and explorers
were button-holed in clubs and strenuously pumped on the subject of
abstruse native poisons; horrid experiments performed in German
laboratories were communicated in unreadable documents; and the life of
Sir James Lubbock, who had the misfortune to be a particular friend of

watch before the Host. The only other occupant of the church was a
priest in a cassock, who was busy with the ornaments on the High Altar.
It was the Feast of S. John, Wimsey remembered suddenly. He walked up
the aisle, hoping to find his quarry hidden in some obscure corner. His
==> shoes squeaked. This annoyed him. It was a thing which Bunter never <==
permitted. He was seized with a fancy that the squeak was produced by
diabolic possession—a protest against a religious atmosphere on the part
of his own particular besetting devil. Pleased with this thought, he
moved forward more confidently.

image of him in her mind—blood-boltered, sinister, and—most horrible of
all—an associate and employer of debauched and brutal assassins. To Miss
Climpson’s credit be it said that she never for one moment faltered in
her determination to track the monster to his lurking-place.

knew, had left 110A Piccadilly, so, after considerable thought, she
addressed it to Lord Peter Wimsey, c/o Inspector Parker, The
Police-Station, Crow’s Beach. There was, of course, no Sunday post from
Town. However, it would go with the midnight collection.

Lord Peter missed both Miss Climpson’s communications. Absorbed in the

duly arrived with “Mrs. Merdle” on the Saturday evening. Immense police
activity was displayed in the neighbourhood of the downs, and at
Southampton and Portsmouth, in order to foster the idea that the
authorities supposed the “gang” to be lurking in those districts.
Nothing, as a matter of fact, was farther from Parker’s thoughts. “Let

should be necessary.”

Climpson’s second letter was brought up from the police-station too late
to catch him.


They reached Town at twelve—owing to Wimsey’s brisk work at the

request, as he was anxious to return to the flat. They found the Chief
Commissioner in rather a brusque mood—angry with the _Banner_ and
annoyed with Parker for having failed to muzzle Pillington.

“Excuse me, sir.” An officer put his head in at the door. “Here’s Lord
Peter Wimsey’s man, sir, with an urgent message.”

eye. He laid down two photographs on the table.

“Excuse me, my lord and gentlemen, but would you be so good as to cast
your eyes on these two photographs?”

“Finger-prints?” said the chief, interrogatively.

“One of them is our own official photograph of the prints on the £10,000

looks like the same set of prints, but it’s not one of ours.”

“They appeared similar, sir, to my uninstructed eye. I thought it better

  nobody would think anything of it, but _then_ the old lady—or _young_
  lady as she was when she embarked on this _revolutionary_ proceeding,
  was quite a PIONEER.

  Agatha Dawson was a school-fellow of hers, and _deeply attached_ to
==>   her. And as a result of this friendship, Agatha’s _sister_, Harriet, <==
  married Clara Whittaker’s brother James! But _Agatha_ did not care
  about marriage, any more than _Clara_, and the two ladies lived
  together in a big old house, with immense stables, in a village in
  Warwickshire—Crofton, I think the name was. Clara Whittaker turned out
  to be a remarkably _good business woman_, and worked up a big

She had been in the Dawson family service as a girl—almost born in it as
you might say. Hadn’t her mother been housekeeper to Mr. Henry Dawson,
Miss Agatha’s papa, and to his father before him? She herself had gone
to the big house as stillroom maid when she wasn’t but fifteen. That was
==> when Miss Harriet was only three years old—her as afterwards married Mr. <==
James Whittaker. Yes, and she’d been there when the rest of the family
was born. Mr. Stephen—him as should have been the heir—ah, dear! only
the trouble came and that killed his poor father and there was nothing
left. Yes, a sad business that was. Poor Mr. Henry speculated with
something—Mrs. Cobling wasn’t clear what, but it was all very wicked and

“Mr. Stephen was the only son, then?”

“Well, not exactly, sir. There was the darling twins. Such pretty
children, but they only lived two days. They come four years after Miss
==> Harriet—her as married Mr. James Whittaker.” <==

“Yes, of course. That was how the families became connected.”

at the same school together, and Mrs. Whittaker asked the two young

niece’s subterfuge. A remarkable old lady, certainly, in her way.

“I suppose the Dawson family has practically died out, then,” he said.

“Oh, yes, sir. There’s only Miss Mary now—and she’s a Whittaker, of
==> course. She is Miss Harriet’s grand-daughter, Mr. Charles Whittaker’s <==
only child. She was left all alone, too, when she went to live with Miss
Dawson. Mr. Charles and his wife was killed in one of these dreadful
motors—dear, dear—it seemed we was fated to have nothing but one tragedy
after another. Just to think of Ben and me outliving them all.”

the Dawson family which he had received from the Rev. Hallelujah Dawson,
“here is the point. We have always talked about Mary Whittaker as Agatha
Dawson’s niece; she was always called so and she speaks of the old lady
as her aunt. But if you look at this, you will see that actually she was
no nearer to her than great-niece: she was the grand-daughter of
==> Agatha’s sister Harriet.” <==

“Quite true,” said Mr. Murbles, “but still, she was apparently the
nearest surviving relative, and since Agatha Dawson died in 1925, the
money passed without any question to Mary Whittaker under the old
Property Act. There’s no ambiguity there.”

“Quite right. It’s a silly kind of face, of course, but rather

==> “What do you really think of that story?” inquired Parker. He had <==
dropped in to breakfast with Wimsey the next morning, before departing
in the Notting Dale direction, in quest of an elusive anonymous
letter-writer. “I thought it sounded rather as though our friend had
been a bit too cocksure about his grand medical specialising. After all,
the old girl might so easily have had some sort of heart attack. She was

“Yes. Suppose he’d wanted the patient to make a will in favour of
somebody quite different—somebody outside the story as we know it. And
when he found he couldn’t get any attention paid to him, he sent the new
nurse down as a sort of substitute.”

couldn’t know that the doctor’s fiancée was going to be sent away.
Unless he was in league with the niece, of course, and induced her to
engineer the change of nurses.”

Lord Peter wrote:

“If you want to be immune from silly letters, Charles,” he said, “don’t

send me round to Monomark House to get the name of a client. I couldn’t
do that without official authority, and they would probably kick up an
awful shindy.”

you’ll be the first person I’ve ever taken to see her. She will be very
much touched and pleased.”

He laughed a little self-consciously.

==> “Oh,” said Parker, embarrassed. Although the men were great friends, <==
Wimsey had always preserved a reticence about his personal affairs—not
so much by concealing as by ignoring them. This revelation seemed to
mark a new stage of intimacy, and Parker was not sure that he liked it.

He laughed a little self-consciously.

“Oh,” said Parker, embarrassed. Although the men were great friends,
Wimsey had always preserved a reticence about his personal affairs—not
so much by concealing as by ignoring them. This revelation seemed to
==> mark a new stage of intimacy, and Parker was not sure that he liked it. <==
He conducted his own life with an earnest middle-class morality which he
owed to his birth and up-bringing, and, while theoretically recognising
that Lord Peter’s world acknowledged different standards, he had never
contemplated being personally faced with any result of their application
in practice.

“—rather an experiment,” Wimsey was saying a trifle shyly; “anyway,
she’s quite comfortably fixed in a little flat in Pimlico. You can come,
can’t you, Charles? I really should like you two to meet.”

==> “Oh, yes, rather,” said Parker, hastily, “I should like to very much. <==
Er—how long—I mean—”

“Oh, the arrangement’s only been going a few months,” said Wimsey,
leading the way to the lift, “but it really seems to be working out
quite satisfactorily. Of course, it makes things much easier for me.”

“Oh, the arrangement’s only been going a few months,” said Wimsey,
leading the way to the lift, “but it really seems to be working out
quite satisfactorily. Of course, it makes things much easier for me.”

==> “Just so,” said Parker. <==

“Of course, as you’ll understand—I won’t go into it all till we get
there, and then you’ll see for yourself,” Wimsey chattered on, slamming
the gates of the lift with unnecessary violence—“but, as I was saying,
you’ll observe it’s quite a new departure. I don’t suppose there’s ever

been anything exactly like it before. Of course, there’s nothing new
under the sun, as Solomon said, but after all, I daresay all those wives
and porcupines, as the child said, must have soured his disposition a
little, don’t you know.”

==> “Quite,” said Parker. “Poor fish,” he added to himself, “they _always_ <==
seem to think it’s different.”

“Outlet,” said Wimsey, energetically, “hi! taxi! . . . outlet—everybody
needs an outlet—97A, St. George’s Square—and after all, one can’t really
blame people if it’s just that they need an outlet. I mean, why be

outlet than to make fun of them in books—and, after all, it isn’t really
difficult to write books. Especially if you either write a rotten story
in good English or a good story in rotten English, which is as far as
most people seem to get nowadays. Don’t you agree?”

==> Mr. Parker agreed, and Lord Peter wandered away along the paths of <==
literature, till the cab stopped before one of those tall, awkward
mansions which, originally designed for a Victorian family with
fatigue-proof servants, have lately been dissected each into half a
dozen inconvenient band-boxes and let off in flats.

“Six flights of stairs,” he explained; “it takes her some time to answer
the bell, because there’s no lift, you see. She wouldn’t have a more
expensive flat, though. She thought it wouldn’t be suitable.”

==> Mr. Parker was greatly relieved, if somewhat surprised, by the modesty <==
of the lady’s demands, and, placing his foot on the door-scraper in an
easy attitude, prepared to wait with patience. Before many minutes,
however, the door was opened by a thin, middle-aged woman, with a sharp,
sallow face and very vivacious manner. She wore a neat, dark coat and
skirt, a high-necked blouse and a long gold neck-chain with a variety of

every available inch of space. The sole evidences of dissipation were an
empty eggshell, a used cup and a crumby plate on a breakfast tray. Miss
Climpson promptly subdued this riot by carrying the tray bodily on to
the landing.

==> Mr. Parker, a little bewildered, lowered himself cautiously into a small <==
arm-chair, embellished with a hard, fat little cushion which made it
impossible to lean back. Lord Peter wriggled into the window-seat, lit a
Sobriane and clasped his hands above his knees. Miss Climpson, seated
upright at the table, gazed at him with a gratified air which was
positively touching.

needn’t tell you that. Now, Charles, you’ve got an official kind of way
of puttin’ these things clearly. Will you just weigh in and give Miss
Climpson the gist of that rigmarole our friend served out to us last
night?”

==> Pulling his wits into order, Mr. Parker accordingly obliged with a <==
digest of the doctor’s story. Miss Climpson listened with great
attention, making notes of the dates and details. Parker observed that
she showed great acumen in seizing on the salient points; she asked a
number of very shrewd questions, and her grey eyes were intelligent.
When he had finished, she repeated the story, and he was able to

“A dear old friend of mine used to say that I should have made a very
good lawyer,” said Miss Climpson, complacently, “but of course, when I
was young, girls didn’t have the education or the _opportunities_ they
==> get nowadays, Mr. Parker. I should have liked a good education, but my <==
dear father didn’t believe in it for women. Very old-fashioned, you

“Never mind, Miss Climpson,” said Wimsey, “you’ve got just exactly the

“Oh, thank you very much, Mr. Parker. Here is the twopence. I _never_

Miss Climpson ushered them down all six flights of stairs, volubly
protesting at their protests, and the door closed behind them.

“It is not what you think,” said his lordship, earnestly.

“Of course not,” agreed Parker.

turn out to be secret thinkers. They think in private thoughts which
they publicly repudiate.”

books called ‘Elderly Women,’ and ‘On the Edge of the Explosion’—and the
drunkards make songs upon ’em, poor things.”

==> “Quite, quite,” said Parker. “You mean that Miss Climpson is a kind of <==
inquiry agent for you.”

“She is my ears and tongue,” said Lord Peter, dramatically, “and
especially my nose. She asks questions which a young man could not put

“Naturally—it is mine, therefore brilliant. Just think. People want
questions asked. Whom do they send? A man with large flat feet and a
notebook—the sort of man whose private life is conducted in a series of
inarticulate grunts. I send a lady with a long, woolly jumper on

must move with the times. Citizen taxi-driver, take me to the British
Museum. Can I drop you anywhere? No? So long. I am going to collate a
12th century manuscript of Tristan, while the old order lasts.”

==> Mr. Parker thoughtfully boarded a westward-bound ’bus and was rolled <==
away to do some routine questioning, on his own account, among the
female population of Notting Dale. It did not appear to him to be a
milieu in which the talents of Miss Climpson could be usefully employed.

The red-haired nurse rubbed her fingers slowly along the arm of the
chair, and hesitated.

“If it will make you feel any less unprofessional,” said Lord Peter,
guessing what was in her mind, “I may say that my friend

gives me a sort of right to ask questions.”

“In that case—yes—in that case I think I can speak freely. I never

did it, and fifty to one that I bring it home to her within the year.
Are you on?”

==> Parker laughed. “I’m a poor man, your Majesty,” he temporised. <==

“There you are,” said Lord Peter, triumphantly, “you’re not comfortable
about it yourself. If you were, you’d have said, ‘It’s taking your
money, old chap,’ and closed like a shot, in the happy assurance of a
certainty.”

“Had you said ponies,” replied Lord Peter, “I would have taken your
alleged poverty into consideration and spared you, but
seven-and-sixpence will neither make nor break you. Consequently, I
shall proceed to make my statements good.”

“Shall you apply for an exhumation order and search for poison,
regardless of the analyst’s report? Or kidnap Miss Whittaker and apply
the third-degree in the Gallic manner?”

“Not at all. I am more modern. I shall use up-to-date psychological

“Not at all. I am more modern. I shall use up-to-date psychological
methods. Like the people in the Psalms, I lay traps; I catch men. I
shall let the alleged criminal convict herself.”

“I am indeed. It is a well-established psychological fact that criminals
cannot let well alone. They—”

“Revisit the place of the crime?”

  “Bertha and Evelyn Gotobed, formerly in the service of Miss Agatha

“I don’t know. That’s what’s so interesting. I hope nothing unpleasant
will happen to dear old Murbles. I should hate to lose him. He’s such a
perfect type of the family solicitor. Still, a man in his profession
must be prepared to take risks.”

==> “Oh, bosh!” said Parker. “But I agree that it might be as well to get <==
hold of the girls, if you really want to find out about the Dawson
household. Servants always know everything.”

“It isn’t only that. Don’t you remember that Nurse Philliter said the
girls were sacked shortly before she left herself? Now, passing over the

circumstances she would not be able to carry on any investigations of
sufficient importance to justify her _far too generous_ salary. She had,
however, become friendly with Miss Findlater, who had promised to tell
her _all about_ their doings. Lord Peter replied in reassuring terms.

==> On the Tuesday following, Mr. Parker was just wrestling in prayer with <==
his charlady, who had a tiresome habit of boiling his breakfast kippers
till they resembled heavily pickled loofahs, when the telephone whirred
aggressively.

“Is that you, Charles?” asked Lord Peter’s voice. “I say, Murbles has

had a letter about that girl, Bertha Gotobed. She disappeared from her
lodgings last Thursday, and her landlady, getting anxious, and having
seen the advertisement, is coming to tell us all she knows. Can you come
round to Staple Inn at eleven?”

==> “Dunno,” said Parker, a little irritably. “I’ve got a job to see to. <==
Surely you can tackle it by yourself.”

“Oh, yes!” The voice was peevish. “But I thought you’d like to have some
of the fun. What an ungrateful devil you are. You aren’t taking the
faintest interest in this case.”

[line number in individual story] matching line = 1839    window = 1834 1844

that—you’ll frighten the girl at the Exchange. I’ll see what I can do.
Eleven?—right!—Oh, I say!”

“Cluck!” said the telephone.

==> “Rung off,” said Parker, bitterly. “Bertha Gotobed. H’m! I could have <==
sworn—”

He reached across to the breakfast-table for the _Daily Yell_, which was
propped against the marmalade jar, and read with pursed lips a paragraph
whose heavily leaded headlines had caught his eye, just before the

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 19791    window = 19786 19796


He took up the receiver again and asked for Wimsey’s number. The
man-servant answered him.

“His lordship is in his bath, sir. Shall I put you through?”

==> “Please,” said Parker. <==

The telephone clucked again. Presently Lord Peter’s voice came faintly,
“Hullo!”

“Did the landlady mention where Bertha Gotobed was employed?”

[line number in individual story] matching line = 1905    window = 1900 1910

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 19838    window = 19833 19843



“That’s saved her life. She’ll be in absolutely horrible danger, if she
comes back. We must get hold of her and warn her. And find out what she
knows. Good-bye. I _must_ get some clothes on. Oh, hell!”

==> Cluck! the line went dead again, and Mr. Parker, abandoning the kippers <==
without regret, ran feverishly out of the house and down Lamb’s Conduit
Street to catch a diver tram to Westminster.

The Chief of Scotland Yard, Sir Andrew Mackenzie, was a very old friend
of Lord Peter’s. He received that agitated young man kindly and listened

“Well, well. Have it your own way,” said Sir Andrew, smiling. “If it was
murder, it must have been a poisoning job, for, as I say, there was not
the slightest sign of a wound or a struggle. I’ll let you have the
report of the autopsy. In the meanwhile, if you’d like to run down there
==> with Inspector Parker, you can of course have any facilities you want. <==
And if you discover anything, let me know.”

Wimsey thanked him, and collecting Parker from an adjacent office,
rushed him briskly down the corridor.


[line number in individual story] matching line = 1962    window = 1957 1967

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 19895    window = 19890 19900


the slightest sign of a wound or a struggle. I’ll let you have the
report of the autopsy. In the meanwhile, if you’d like to run down there
with Inspector Parker, you can of course have any facilities you want.
And if you discover anything, let me know.”

==> Wimsey thanked him, and collecting Parker from an adjacent office, <==
rushed him briskly down the corridor.

“I don’t like it,” he said, “that is, of course, it’s very gratifying to
know that our first steps in psychology have led to action, so to speak,
but I wish to God it hadn’t been quite such decisive action. We’d better

know that our first steps in psychology have led to action, so to speak,
but I wish to God it hadn’t been quite such decisive action. We’d better
trot down to Epping straight away, and see the landlady later. I’ve got
a new car, by the way, which you’ll like.”

==> Mr. Parker took one look at the slim black monster, with its long rakish <==
body and polished-copper twin exhausts, and decided there and then that
the only hope of getting down to Epping without interference was to look
as official as possible and wave his police authority under the eyes of
every man in blue along the route. He shoe-horned himself into his seat
without protest, and was more unnerved than relieved to find himself

The promise was fulfilled before their arrival at the spot where the
body had been found. Their arrival made a considerable sensation among
the little crowd which business or curiosity had drawn to the spot. Lord
Peter was instantly pounced upon by four reporters and a synod of Press
photographers, whom his presence encouraged in the hope that the mystery
==> might turn out to be a three-column splash after all. Parker, to his <==
annoyance, was photographed in the undignified act of extricating
himself from “Mrs. Merdle.” Superintendent Walmisley came politely to
his assistance, rebuked the onlookers, and led him to the scene of
action.

The Superintendent glanced sharply at the Scotland Yard man.

“You don’t suppose she was brought and put here, do you, sir?”

==> “I don’t suppose anything,” retorted Parker, “I merely drew attention to <==
a point which I think you should consider. What are these wheel-marks?”

“That’s our car, sir. We backed it up here and took her up that way.”

“And all this trampling is your men too, I suppose?”

“I think you’re mistaken,” said Wimsey, placidly. “When did the girl
disappear, exactly?”

“Well, she went off duty at the Corner House at five a week ago

“And this is the _Evening Views_ of Wednesday, 27th,” said Wimsey. “Late
Final edition. Now that edition isn’t on the streets till about 6
o’clock. So unless somebody brought it down and had supper here, it was
probably brought by the girl herself or her companion. It’s hardly

“Crushed again,” said Wimsey. “Still, it’s a curious coincidence.”

“It is, my lord, and I’m very glad you found the things. Will you take

“Better take them along and put them with the other things,” said
Parker, extending his hand to take them from Wimsey, whom they seemed to
interest quite disproportionately. “I fancy his lordship’s right and
that the parcel came here along with the girl. And that certainly looks

her. Looks like the old, old story. Take care of that bottle, old man,

before you caution your respectable young railway clerk that anything he
says may be taken down and used against him, you will cast your eye, and
your nose, upon this ham sandwich.”

“Nothing. It appears to be in astonishingly good preservation, thanks to
this admirable oak-tree. The stalwart oak—for so many centuries
Britain’s bulwark against the invader! Heart of oak are our ships—not
hearts, by the way, as it is usually misquoted. But I am puzzled by the

it to an incorruptible and more glorious body? I may add that it costs
about 3s. a pound uncooked—an argument which you will allow to be
weighty.”

==> “That’s odd, certainly,” said Parker. “I imagine that only rich people—” <==

“Only rich people or people who understand eating as a fine art,” said
Wimsey. “The two classes are by no means identical, though they
occasionally overlap.”

“Only rich people or people who understand eating as a fine art,” said
Wimsey. “The two classes are by no means identical, though they

carefully. “We’d better go along now and see the body.”

The examination was not a very pleasant matter, for the weather had been
damp and warm and there had certainly been weasels. In fact, after a
brief glance, Wimsey left the two policemen to carry on alone, and

Lord Peter’s gravity was somewhat upset by this diatribe against the
highly respectable Mr. Murbles of Staple Inn, whose own version of Mrs.
Gulliver’s communication had been decently expurgated. “How shocked the

see him.”

Mrs. Gulliver’s voice moaned on and on.

“Such respectable girls, both of them, and Miss Evelyn married to that

so, her not coming back. There’s many nowadays as would wash one’s hands
and glad to be rid of them, knowing what they might be up to. No. When
the time passed and she didn’t come back, I said, Mark my words, I said,
she’s bin kidnapped, I said, by that Murbles.”

==> “Had she been long with you, Mrs. Gulliver?” asked Parker. <==

“Not above a fifteen month or so, she hadn’t, but bless you, I don’t
have to know a young lady fifteen days to know if she’s a good girl or
not. You gets to know by the look of ’em almost, when you’ve ’ad my
experience.”

Bunter, “have you got anything fresh?”

“Yes, I’ve got a new theory of the crime, which knocks yours into a
cocked hat. I’ve got evidence to support it, too.”

“I see. And you’re now going to tell me that Bertha Gotobed was got hold
of by the White Slave people.”

“Because Scotland Yard have two maggots which crop up whenever anything
happens to a young woman. Either it’s White Slavery or Dope
Dens—sometimes both. You are going to say it’s both.”

“And they bustle her off and get rid of her. It’s quite possible. The
post-mortem may tell us something about it. Yes, Bunter, what is it?”

“Excuse me,” said Parker, “I asked the people at the flower-shop to ring
me up here, if Mrs. Forrest came in. If she’s there, would you like to
come round with me?”

==> Parker returned from the telephone with an air of subdued triumph. <==

“She’s just gone up to her flat. Come along. We’ll take a taxi—not that
death-rattle of yours. Hurry up, I don’t want to miss her.”

The door of the flat in South Audley Street was opened by Mrs. Forrest

The door of the flat in South Audley Street was opened by Mrs. Forrest
in person. Wimsey recognised her instantly from the description. On
==> seeing Parker’s card, she made no objection whatever to letting them in, <==
and led the way into a pink and mauve sitting-room, obviously furnished
by contract from a Regent Street establishment.

“Please sit down. Will you smoke? And your friend?”

and led the way into a pink and mauve sitting-room, obviously furnished

“Please sit down. Will you smoke? And your friend?”

==> “My colleague, Mr. Templeton,” said Parker, promptly. <==

Mrs. Forrest’s rather hard eyes appeared to sum up in a practised manner
the difference between Parker’s seven-guinea “fashionable lounge
suiting, tailored in our own workrooms, fits like a made-to-measure
suit,” and his “colleague’s” Savile Row outlines, but beyond a slight

“Yes, I think I was. Yes, certainly. I was in Town for several days
about that time. How can I help you?”

“It is a question of a certain bank-note which has been traced to your
==> possession,” said Parker, “a £5 note numbered x/y58929. It was issued to <==
you by Lloyds Bank in payment of a cheque on the 19th.”

“Very likely. I can’t say I remember the number, but I think I cashed a
cheque about that time. I can tell in a moment by my cheque-book.”

trace those notes. One of them has turned up since in—other
circumstances.”

“May I know what the circumstances are, or is it an official secret?”

==> Parker hesitated. He rather wished now, that he had demanded point-blank <==
at the start how Mrs. Forrest’s £5 note had come to be found on the dead
body of the waitress at Epping. Taken by surprise, the woman might have
got flustered. Now, he had let her entrench herself securely behind this
horse story. Impossible to follow up the history of a bank-note handed
to an unknown bookie at a race-meeting. Before he could speak, Wimsey

“I knew it!” cried Wimsey. “And that girl Evelyn was sure of it too. Who
was it, Mrs. Forrest? Answer me that!”

“There—there was no one,” said Mrs. Forrest, with a thick gasp.

==> “Oh, come, Mrs. Forrest, think again,” said Parker, taking his cue <==
promptly, “you aren’t going to tell us that you accounted by yourself
for three bottles of Veuve Clicquot and two people’s dinners.”

“Not forgetting the ham,” put in Wimsey, with fussy self-importance,
“the Bradenham ham specially cooked and sent up by Fortnum & Mason. Now,

The woman’s hands clutched at the pink silk cushions, making little hot,
tight creases. “I—would you mind getting me something to drink? In the
dining-room, through there—on the sideboard.”

Wimsey got up quickly and disappeared into the next room. He took rather
==> a long time, Parker thought. Mrs. Forrest was lying back in a collapsed <==
attitude, but her breathing was more controlled, and she was, he
thought, recovering her wits. “Making up a story,” he muttered savagely
to himself. However, he could not, without brutality, press her at the
moment.

right. Put it down. That’s the stuff to pull you together. How about
another little one, what? Oh, rot, it can’t hurt you. Mind if I have one
myself? I’m feelin’ a bit flustered. Upsettin’, delicate business and
all that. Just another spot. That’s the idea.”

==> He trotted out again, glass in hand, while Parker fidgeted. The presence <==
of amateur detectives was sometimes an embarrassment. Wimsey clattered
in again, this time, with more common sense, bringing decanter, syphon
and three glasses, bodily, on a tray.

“Now, now,” said Wimsey, “now we’re feeling better, do you think you can

“Now, now,” said Wimsey, “now we’re feeling better, do you think you can
answer our question, Mrs. Forrest?”

“May I know, first of all, what right you have to ask it?”

==> Parker shot an exasperated glance at his friend. This came of giving <==
people time to think.

“Right?” burst in Wimsey. “Right? Of course, we’ve a right. The police
have a right to ask questions when anything’s the matter. Here’s murder
the matter! Right, indeed?”

the matter! Right, indeed?”

“Murder?”

==> A curious intent look came into her eyes. Parker could not place it, but <==
Wimsey recognised it instantly. He had seen it last on the face of a
great financier as he took up his pen to sign a contract. Wimsey had
been called to witness the signature, and had refused. It was a contract
that ruined thousands of people. Incidentally, the financier had been
murdered soon after, and Wimsey had declined to investigate the matter,

“I’m afraid,” Mrs. Forrest was saying, “that in that case I can’t help
you. I _did_ have a friend dining with me on the 26th, but he has not,
so far as I know, been murdered, nor has he murdered anybody.”

==> “It was a man, then?” said Parker. <==

Mrs. Forrest bowed her head with a kind of mocking ruefulness. “I live
apart from my husband,” she murmured.

“I am sorry,” said Parker, “to have to press for this gentleman’s name

obliged—uncommonly so. Please don’t trouble to see us out.”

He teetered nervously down the narrow hall-way, in his imbecile and
==> well-bred way, Parker following with a policeman-like stiffness. No <==
sooner, however, had the flat-door closed behind them than Wimsey seized
his friend by the arm and bundled him helter-skelter into the lift.

“I thought we should never get away,” he panted. “Now quick—how do we
get round to the back of these flats?”

you wouldn’t stampede me like this. I’ve no business to let you come
with me on a job at all, and if I do, you might have the decency to keep
quiet.”

“Right you are,” said Wimsey, cheerfully, “just let’s do this little bit

the agility of a cat-burglar. About fifteen feet from the ground he
paused, reached up, and appeared to detach something with a quick jerk,
and then slid very gingerly to the ground again, holding his right hand
at a cautious distance from his body, as though it were breakable.

long-stemmed glass in his fingers, similar to those from which they had
drunk in Mrs. Forrest’s sitting-room.

prescription headed ‘The injection, Mrs. Forrest. One to be injected
when the pain is very severe.’ What do you think of that?”

really impressed. “You didn’t bring the prescription, I suppose?”

“No, and I didn’t inform the lady who we were or what we were after or
ask her permission to carry away the family crystal. But I made a note
of the chemist’s address.”

wiping out of Bertha was a pure coincidence and nothing to do with my
advertisement.”

“Well, I hope you’ll be cheered to learn that the analysis of the body
has been made, and that there is not the slightest sign of foul play.
There is no trace of violence or of poisoning. There was a heart
weakness of fairly long standing, and the verdict is syncope after a
heavy meal.”

you suppose they bear to the successful crimes—the ones we hear nothing

“My good man, I know that where a crime is known to have been committed,
you people manage to catch the perpetrator in at least sixty per cent of
the cases. But the moment a crime is even suspected, it falls, _ipso

the cases. But the moment a crime is even suspected, it falls, _ipso
facto_, into the category of failures. After that, the thing is merely a
question of greater or less efficiency on the part of the police. But
how about the crimes which are never even suspected?”

“How can anybody answer that?”

“Well—one may guess. Read any newspaper to-day. Read the _News of the
World_. Or, now that the Press has been muzzled, read the divorce court

gastric enteritis and influenzas that get certified are not nature’s
unaided work. Murder’s so easy, Charles, so damned easy—even without
special training.”

my lips over ways and means of murdering Miss Dawson.”

“Well, anyhow, till you can think of one that defies analysis and
doesn’t seem to need a motive, you haven’t found the right one,” said
==> Parker, practically, rather revolted by this ghoulish conversation. <==

“I admit that,” replied Lord Peter, “but that only shows that as yet I’m

“Just as you like, Bunter. But I did hope you sometimes got tired like

Bunter smiled discreetly and withdrew.

==> “Well, we’ve gained this much, anyhow,” said Parker. “We know now that <==
this Miss Whittaker has something to conceal, since she takes such
precautions to avoid being followed.”

“We know more than that. We know that she was desperately anxious to get
hold of the Cropper woman before anybody else could see her, no doubt to

“Mrs. Cropper sent a cable, which was read at the inquest.”

“Damn these inquests. They give away all the information one wants kept
quiet, and produce no evidence worth having.”

sit through a lot of moral punk by the Coroner, about the prevalence of
jazz and the immoral behaviour of modern girls in going off alone with
young men to Epping Forest.”

“It’s a pity these busy-bodies can’t be had up for libel. Never mind.

The two men pulled at their pipes for some time in silence.

“The aunt evidently intended the money to go to Mary Whittaker all

really Whittaker money which had come to her over the head of the Rev.
Charles, or whatever his name was.”

“Oh, yes—warned by his minions that Miss Dawson is hob-nobbing with
solicitors and being tempted into making wills and things, gets the said
minions to polish her off before she can do any mischief.”

“God bless my soul,” said Lord Peter, when he had disentangled this
screed—“here’s our claimant ready made.”

wonder where the Rev. Hallelujah has got to—and where he came from.
He—er—he wouldn’t be in ‘Crockford,’ I suppose.”

“He would be, probably, if he’s Church of England,” said Lord Peter,
dubiously, going in search of that valuable work of reference.

that the Warwick County Council had pitched upon that particular week
for a grand repainting of signposts and had reached the preliminary
stage of laying a couple of thick coats of gleaming white paint over all
the lettering. At intervals the patient Bunter unpacked himself from the
back seat and climbed one of these uncommunicative guides to peer at its

Quartermain trying to trace the features of the departed Kings of the
Kukuanas under their calcareous shrouds of stalactite. One of the posts
turned out to be in the wet-paint stage, which added to the depression
of the party. Finally, after several misdirections, blind alleys, and
reversings back to the main road, they came to a fourways. The signpost

reversings back to the main road, they came to a fourways. The signpost
here must have been in extra need of repairs, for its arms had been
removed bodily; it stood, stark and ghastly—a long, livid finger erected
in wild protest to the unsympathetic heavens.

==> “It’s starting to rain,” observed Parker, conversationally. <==

“Look here, Charles, if you’re going to bear up cheerfully and be the
life and soul of the expedition, say so and have done with it. I’ve got
a good, heavy spanner handy under the seat, and Bunter can help to bury

passed half an hour ago, one of those roads leads directly to Crofton.”

“That would be highly encouraging if we only knew which road we were

“He’s lost his way too, or he wouldn’t be sitting there,” retorted the

grim old woman sitting so uncompromisingly upright with the reins in her
hand. A dour, weather-beaten old face, but certainly handsome still,
with its large nose and straight, heavy eyebrows. And beside her,
smaller, plumper and more feminine, was the Agatha Dawson whose curious
death had led them to this quiet country place. She had a sweet, smiling

Three and eightpence, sir, thank you, sir. Hurry up, gentlemen, please.
Now then, Joe, look sharp.”

==> “Great place, Crofton,” said Lord Peter, when he and Parker were left <==
alone in a great, low-ceilinged bedroom, where the sheets smelt of
lavender. “Ben Cobling’s sure to know all about Cousin Hallelujah. I’m
looking forward to Ben Cobling.”

The ale went down in silence.

Mr. Piggin roused himself presently from contemplation to tell a story
of Miss Whittaker in the hunting-field. Mr. Cobling capped this by
==> another. Lord Peter said “Ah!” Parker then emerged and was introduced, <==
and Mr. Cobling begged the privilege of standing a round of drinks. This
ritual accomplished, Mr. Piggin begged the company would be his guests
for a third round, and then excused himself on the plea of customers to
attend to.

for a third round, and then excused himself on the plea of customers to

He went in, and Lord Peter, by skilful and maddeningly slow degrees,
began to work his way back to the history of the Dawson family.

further sharpened in the London police service—endeavoured now and again
to get matters along faster by a brisk question. The result, every time,
was to make Mr. Cobling lose the thread of his remarks and start him off
into a series of interminable side-tracks. Wimsey kicked his friend
viciously on the anklebone to keep him quiet, and with endless patience

worked the conversation back to the main road again.

At the end of an hour or so, Mr. Cobling explained that his wife could
tell them a great deal more about Miss Dawson than what he could, and
invited them to visit his cottage. This invitation being accepted with
==> alacrity, the party started off, Mr. Cobling explaining to Parker that <==
he was eighty-seven come next Michaelmas, and hearty still, indeed,
stronger than he appeared, bar the rheumatics that troubled him. “I’m
not saying as I’m not bent,” said Mr. Cobling, “but that’s more the work
of the ’osses. Regular lived with ’osses all my life—”

Mrs. Cobling turned out to be a delightful old lady, exactly like a
dried-up pippin and only two years younger than her husband. She was
entranced at getting an opportunity to talk about her darling Miss
==> Agatha. Parker, thinking it necessary to put forward some reason for the <==
inquiry, started on an involved explanation, and was kicked again. To
Mrs. Cobling, nothing could be more natural than that all the world
should be interested in the Dawsons, and she prattled gaily on without
prompting.

grandchildren and three great-grandchildren. Maybe you’d like to see
their pictures, sir.”

confirmatory noises. The life-histories of all the children and
descendants were detailed at suitable length. Whenever a pause seemed
discernible, Parker would mutter hopefully in Wimsey’s car, “How about
Cousin Hallelujah?” but before a question could be put, the interminable
family chronicle was resumed.

and “gone over” to the Scarlet Woman and—again the pause and the
hush—become a monk. A terrible to-do it made. And he’d lived to be a
very old man, and for all Mrs. Cobling knew was living yet, still in the
error of his ways.

==> “If he’s alive,” murmured Parker, “he’s probably the real heir. He’d be <==
Agatha Dawson’s uncle and her nearest relation.”

Wimsey frowned and returned to the charge.

“Well, it couldn’t have been Mr. Paul I had in mind,” he said, “because

Having by this time heard all the Coblings had to tell, Wimsey and

Dawson had withdrawn her affairs from Mr. Probyn’s hands and had lodged

never had any connection with the Dawson family. They had no objection,
however, to furnishing Mr. Probyn’s address—Villa Bianca, Fiesole. They
regretted that they could be of no further assistance to Lord Peter

subject of food, Wimsey was vague and abstracted. Something seemed to be
worrying at the back of his mind, and even when Mr. Murbles appeared,
full of mild legal humour, Wimsey listened to him with extreme courtesy
indeed, but with only half his attention.

they inherit?”

“Why—why, yes, I suppose they would,” said Mr. Murbles, with less
certainty, however. “Oh, yes, I think they would.”

==> “Clearly they would,” said Parker, a little impatiently, “if it says to <==
the issue of the deceased’s brothers and sisters.”

“Ah! but we must not be precipitate,” said Mr. Murbles, rounding upon
him. “To the lay mind, doubtless, the word ‘issue’ appears a simple one.
But in law”—(Mr. Murbles, who up till this point had held the

him. “To the lay mind, doubtless, the word ‘issue’ appears a simple one.
But in law”—(Mr. Murbles, who up till this point had held the
index-finger of the right hand poised against the ring-finger of the
left, in recognition of the claims of the brothers and sisters of the
half-blood, now placed his left palm upon the table and wagged his right
==> index-finger admonishingly in Parker’s direction)—“in _law_ the word may <==
bear one of two, or indeed several, interpretations according to the
nature of the document in which it occurs and the date of that
document.”

“But in the new Act—” urged Lord Peter.

money passed without any question to Mary Whittaker under the old
Property Act. There’s no ambiguity there.”

“No,” said Wimsey, “none whatever, that’s the point. But—”

==> “Good God!” broke in Parker, “I see what you’re driving at. When did the <==
new Act come into force, sir?”

“In January, 1926,” replied Mr. Murbles.

“And Miss Dawson died, rather unexpectedly, as we know, in November,

if there was any doubt about it—how tempting, don’t you see, to give her
a little push over the edge, so as to make her die in 1925. Especially
as she couldn’t live long anyhow, and there were no other relatives to
be defrauded.”

==> “That reminds me,” put in Parker, “suppose the great-niece is excluded <==
from the inheritance, where does the money go?”

“It goes to the Duchy of Lancaster—or in other words, to the Crown.”

“In fact,” said Wimsey, “to no one in particular. Upon my soul, I really

“Ethically,” observed Mr. Murbles, “there may be much to be said for
your point of view. Legally, I am afraid, murder is murder, however
frail the victim or convenient the result.”

==> “And Agatha Dawson didn’t want to die,” added Parker, “she said so.” <==

“No,” said Wimsey, thoughtfully, “and I suppose she had a right to an
opinion.”

“I think,” said Mr. Murbles, “that before we go any further, we ought to

tone. He was a large, square man with a florid face and a harsh voice.
In court, he was famous for a way of saying, “Come now,” as a preface to
tying recalcitrant witnesses into tight knots, which he would then
proceed to slash open with a brilliant confutation. He knew Wimsey by
==> sight, expressed himself delighted to meet Inspector Parker, and bustled <==
his guests into the room with jovial shouts.

“I’ve been going into this little matter while you were coming along,”
he said. “Awkward, eh? ha! Astonishing thing that people can’t say what
they mean when they draw Acts, eh? ha! Why do you suppose it is, Lord

mind of the court in deciding how the word ‘issue’ was to be construed
for the purposes of the new Act.”

“Well,” said Mr. Murbles, “I bow to your superior knowledge.”

==> “In any case,” broke in Parker, “any uncertainty in the matter would <==
provide as good a motive for murder as the certainty of exclusion from
inheritance. If Mary Whittaker only _thought_ she might lose the money
in the event of her great-aunt’s surviving into 1926, she might quite
well be tempted to polish her off a little earlier, and make sure.”

“Well, if I did go in for it, I’d take reasonable precautions,” retorted
Wimsey. “’S wonderful, of course, the tomfool things murderers _do_ do.
But I have the highest opinion of Miss Whittaker’s brains. I bet she
covered her tracks pretty well.”

==> “You don’t think Mr. Probyn mentioned the matter,” suggested Parker, <==
“the time he went down and tried to get Miss Dawson to make her will.”

“I _don’t_,” said Wimsey, with energy, “but I’m pretty certain he tried
to explain matters to the old lady, only she was so terrified of the
very idea of a will she wouldn’t let him get a word in. But I fancy old

“Anyway,” said Wimsey, “we can easily find out. Probyn’s in Italy—I was
going to write to him, but perhaps you’d better do it, Murbles. And, in
the meanwhile, Charles and I will think up a way to find whoever it was
that did give Miss Whittaker an opinion on the matter.”

==> “You’re not forgetting, I suppose,” said Parker, rather dryly, “that <==
before pinning down a murder to any particular motive, it is usual to
ascertain that a murder has been committed? So far, all we know is that,
after a careful post-mortem analysis, two qualified doctors have agreed
that Miss Dawson died a natural death.”

epoch-making work: _The Murderer’s Vade-Mecum, or 101 Ways of Causing

But he saw the Chief Commissioner next morning and reported that he was
at last disposed to take the Dawson case seriously.

“What name?”

“A Mrs. Forrest. She wouldn’t say what she wanted.”

==> “Odd,” thought Parker. His researches in the matter had been so <==
unfruitful that he had practically eliminated Mrs. Forrest from the
Gotobed mystery—merely keeping her filed, as it were, in the back of his
mind for future reference. It occurred to him, whimsically, that she had
at length discovered the absence of one of her wine-glasses and was
ringing him up in a professional capacity. His conjectures were

at length discovered the absence of one of her wine-glasses and was
ringing him up in a professional capacity. His conjectures were
interrupted by his being called to the telephone to answer Mrs.
Forrest’s call.

==> “Is that Detective-Inspector Parker?—I’m so sorry to trouble you, but <==
could you give me Mr. Templeton’s address?”

“Templeton?” said Parker, momentarily puzzled.

“Wasn’t it Templeton—the gentleman who came with you to see me?”

[line number in individual story] matching line = 5662    window = 5657 5667

could you give me Mr. Templeton’s address?”

==> “Templeton?” said Parker, momentarily puzzled. <==

“Wasn’t it Templeton—the gentleman who came with you to see me?”

“Oh, yes, of course—I beg your pardon—I—the matter had slipped my

“Not _quite_ freely,” purred the voice at the other end of the wire,
“you are rather official, you know. I should prefer just to write to Mr.
Templeton privately, and leave it to him to take up with you.”

==> “I see.” Parker’s brain worked briskly. It might be inconvenient to have <==
Mrs. Forrest writing to Mr. Templeton at 110A, Piccadilly. The letter
might not be delivered. Or, if the lady were to take it into her head to
call and discovered that Mr. Templeton was not known to the porter, she
might take alarm and bottle up her valuable information.

“Oh, yes, that would do. Is he in the book?”

“No—but I can give you his private number.”

Moreover, he felt that the thing would be a nuisance. Mrs. Forrest was
handsome enough, but she had not a particle of attraction for him. For
all her make-up and her somewhat outspoken costume, she struck him as
spinsterish—even epicene. That was the thing which puzzled him during
==> their previous interview. Parker—a young man of rigid virtue and limited <==
worldly knowledge—was not sensitive to these emanations. But Wimsey had
felt her as something essentially sexless, even then. And he felt it
even more strongly now. Never had he met a woman in whom “the great It,”
eloquently hymned by Mrs. Elinor Glyn, was so completely lacking.

to take official notice of it. Oh well! he supposed he must go on with
these infernal solicitors.

He was proceeding on a system of his own, which might or might not prove
fruitful. He had reviewed the subject of the new Property Act, and

advice.

Her first thought would no doubt be to consult a solicitor in
Leahampton, and unless she already had the idea of foul play in her
mind, there was nothing to deter her from doing so. Accordingly,
==> Parker’s first move had been to run down to Leahampton and interview the <==
three firms of solicitors there. All three were able to reply quite
positively that they had never received such an inquiry from Miss
Whittaker, or from anybody, during the year 1925. One solicitor,
indeed—the senior partner of Hodgson & Hodgson, to whom Miss Dawson had
entrusted her affairs after her quarrel with Mr. Probyn—looked a little

“I assure you, Inspector,” he said, “that if the point had been brought
to my notice in such a way, I should certainly have remembered it, in
the light of subsequent events.”

question arose of winding up the estate and proving Miss Whittaker’s
claim to inherit?”

“I can’t say it did. Had there been any question of searching for
next-of-kin it might—I don’t say it would—have occurred to me. But I had

a very clear history of the family connections from Mr. Probyn, the
death took place nearly two months before the Act came into force, and
the formalities all went through more or less automatically. In fact, I
never thought about the Act one way or another in that connection.”

==> Parker said he was not surprised to hear it, and favoured Mr. Hodgson <==
with Mr. Towkington’s learned opinion on the subject, which interested
Mr. Hodgson very much. And that was all he got at Leahampton, except
that he fluttered Miss Climpson very much by calling upon her and
hearing all about her interview with Vera Findlater. Miss Climpson
walked to the station with him, in the hope that they might meet Miss

hearing all about her interview with Vera Findlater. Miss Climpson
walked to the station with him, in the hope that they might meet Miss

After all, though he would like to see Miss Whittaker, he was not
particularly keen on her seeing him, especially in Miss Climpson’s
company. “By the way,” he said to Miss Climpson, “you had better explain
me in some way to Mrs. Budge, or she may be a bit inquisitive.”

that came into my mind at the moment. I can’t _think_ why, for I’ve
never known an Adolphus.”

So here he was, working out his second line of inquiry. If Miss
Whittaker did not go to a Leahampton solicitor, to whom would she go?
There was Mr. Probyn, of course, but he did not think she would have

the meter. Where strangers are friendly and friends are casual. London,
whose rather untidy and grubby bosom is the repository of so many odd
secrets. Discreet, incurious and all-enfolding London.

one she’d try London. They mostly think they’re safer there.”

Mr. Trigg was a pleasant, fresh-faced man in his early forties. He

For the thirty-seventh time, Parker started on the opening gambit which

importance, is it? The point is this. My wife and I have come up to Town
to see her great-aunt, who is in a very bad way. In fact, she isn’t
expected to live.

“Well, now, the old lady has always been fond of my wife, don’t you see,

into her money when she died. It’s quite a tidy bit, and we have been—I
won’t say looking forward to it, but in a kind of mild way counting on
it as something for us to retire upon later on. You understand. There
aren’t any other relations at all, so, though the old lady has often
talked about making a will, we didn’t worry much, one way or the other,

one made without delay if the testatrix is capable of making one.
Otherwise I think there is a very real danger of your wife’s losing her
inheritance.”

==> “You seem quite familiar with the question,” said Parker, with a smile; <==
“I suppose you are always being asked it since this new Act came in?”

“I wouldn’t say ‘always.’ It is comparatively rare for a great-niece to
be left as sole next-of-kin.”

A most curious expression came over the solicitor’s face—it looked
almost like alarm.

“What makes you ask that?”

==> “You need have no hesitation in answering,” said Parker, taking out his <==
official card. “I am a police officer and have a good reason for asking.
I put the legal point to you first as a problem of my own, because I was
anxious to have your professional opinion first.”

“That sounds interesting. Will you tell the story in your own way and

“Certainly. Just a moment.” Mr. Trigg put his head out into the outer

Parker accepted the invitation and lit up his well-worn briar, while Mr.

“It is; I have rather a good memory; besides, I saw her on other
occasions, as you shall hear.

“Anyhow, she went away then after paying my fee, and I noticed that the
‘friend’s great-aunt’ had suddenly become ‘Auntie,’ and decided that my
client felt a certain personal interest in the matter.”

==> “I fancy she had,” said Parker. “When did you see her again?” <==

“Oddly enough, I ran across her in the following December. I was having
a quick and early dinner in Soho, before going on to a show. The little
place I usually patronise was very full, and I had to sit at a table
where a woman was already seated. As I muttered the usual formula about

almost masculine understanding. I may say I am not the sort of a man who
prefers women to be brainless. No, I am rather modern in that respect.
If ever I was to take a wife, Inspector, I should wish her to be an
intelligent companion.”

==> Parker said Mr. Trigg’s attitude did him great credit. He also made the <==
mental observation that Mr. Trigg would probably not object to marrying
a young woman who had inherited money and was unencumbered with
relations.

“It is rare,” went on Mr. Trigg, “to find a woman with a legal mind.

for, as I said, it was a beast of a night, and the room was cold. I
looked round for some extra coals to put on the fire, but could see
none.”

==> “That,” said Parker, “is extremely interesting and suggestive.” <==

“I thought it queer at the time. But the whole thing was queer. Anyway,
I then said I was ready to begin. She said, ‘You may think I am a little
mad, because my head has been so hurt. But I am quite sane. But he
shan’t have a penny of the money.’ I asked her if someone had attacked

something else.

“Across the back of the fingers of the right hand went a curious scar—as
though a chisel or some such thing had slipped and cut them.”

==> Parker sat upright in his chair. <==

“Yes,” said Mr. Trigg, “that interests you. It startled me. Or rather,
startled isn’t quite the word. In my oppressed state, it affected me
like some kind of nightmare. I struggled upright in my chair, and the
woman sank back upon her pillows.

“I’m sure it was. Did you ever hear from Miss Grant again?”

“Why, yes. She rang me up twice—once, after three months, and again only
a fortnight ago, asking for an appointment. You may think me cowardly,
==> Mr. Parker, but each time I put her off. I didn’t quite know what might <==
happen. As a matter of fact, the opinion I formed in my own mind was
that I had been entrapped into that house with the idea of making me
spend the night there and afterwards blackmailing me. That was the only
explanation I could think of which would account for the
sleeping-draught. I thought discretion was the better part of valour,

“No, of course not. Well, if she does it again, will you please make an
appointment with her, and then let me know about it at once? A call to
Scotland Yard will always find me.”

“And now we know,” thought Parker as he returned home, “that somebody—an
odd unscrupulous somebody—was making inquiries about great-nieces in

inveigled into a house of mystery and is semi-poisoned. I wonder what
would have happened to Mr. Probyn, if he had been careless enough to
remain in England.”

==> “I deny nothing,” replied Parker. “I will only point out to you that <==
during the month in which these disasters occurred to the Gotobed
family, the object of your suspicions was in Kent with Miss Vera
Findlater, who never left her side.”

“As against that undoubted snag,” rejoined Wimsey, “I bring forward a

sepulchre to the mast even though it crush me in the attempt! Loud
applause. His chin sank broodingly upon his dressing-gown, and he
breathed a few guttural notes into the bass saxophone which was the
cherished companion of his solitary hours in the bathroom.”

==> Parker ostentatiously took up the book which he had laid aside on <==
Wimsey’s entrance.

“Tell me when you’ve finished,” he said, caustically.

“I’ve hardly begun. The means, I repeat, seems insoluble—and so the

the other nurses. I say, how about getting hold of Dr. Carr again? Or,
no—if he’d got any ideas on the subject he’d have trotted ’em out before
now. I know! I’ll ask Lubbock, the analyst. He’ll do. I’ll get in touch
with him to-morrow.”

==> “And meanwhile,” said Parker, “I suppose we just sit round and wait for <==
somebody else to be murdered.”

“It’s beastly, isn’t it? I still feel poor Bertha Gotobed’s blood on my
head, so to speak. I say!”

into a house after dark and appropriated a scuttleful of coal to her own
use. Trigg could identify her—he seems to have paid the lady particular
attention on more than one occasion—and we could rake up his taxi-man
for corroborative detail.”

==> Parker pulled at his pipe for a few minutes. <==

“There’s something in that,” he said finally. “I think perhaps it’s
worth while putting it before the authorities. But we mustn’t be in too
much of a hurry, you know. I wish we were further ahead with our other
proofs. There’s such a thing as Habeas Corpus—you can’t hold on to

Dash it all, be reasonable. I’ve built you up a case out of nothing.
Isn’t that handsome enough? Base ingratitude—that’s what’s the matter
with you.”


==> Parker’s inquiries took some time, and June lingered into its longest <==
days.

Chamberlin and Levine flew the Atlantic, and Segrave bade farewell to
Brooklands. The _Daily Yell_ wrote anti-Red leaders and discovered a
plot, somebody laid claim to a marquisate, and a Czecho-Slovakian

analyst lives by symptoms and tests, and nobody likes suggestions that
undermine the very foundations of his profession—“not even old age or
mental decay. There are always symptoms.”

Fortunately, before symptoms of mental decay could become too pronounced
==> in Lord Peter, Parker sounded the call to action. <==

“I’m going down to Leahampton with a warrant,” he said. “I may not use
it, but the chief thinks it might be worth while to make an inquiry.
What with the Battersea mystery and the Daniels business, and Bertha
Gotobed, there seems to be a feeling that there have been too many

the cobwebs, don’t you know. It might even inspire me to invent a good
way of murderin’ people. ‘O Inspiration, solitary child, warbling thy
native wood-notes wild—’ Did somebody write that, or did I invent it? It
sounds reminiscent, somehow.”

==> Parker, who was out of temper, replied rather shortly, and intimated <==
that the police car would be starting for Leahampton in an hour’s time.

“I will be there,” said Wimsey, “though, mind you, I hate being driven
by another fellow. It feels so unsafe. Never mind. I will be bloody,
bold and resolute, as Queen Victoria said to the Archbishop of

bold and resolute, as Queen Victoria said to the Archbishop of
Canterbury.”


They reached Leahampton without any incident to justify Lord Peter’s
==> fears. Parker had brought another officer with him, and on the way they <==
picked up the Chief Constable of the County, who appeared very dubiously
disposed towards their errand. Lord Peter, observing their array of five
strong men, going out to seize upon one young woman, was reminded of the
Marquise de Brinvilliers—(“What! all that water for a little person like
me?”)—but this led him back to the subject of poison, and he remained

Marquise de Brinvilliers—(“What! all that water for a little person like
me?”)—but this led him back to the subject of poison, and he remained
steeped in thought and gloom till the car drew up before the house in
Wellington Avenue.

==> Parker got out, and went up the path with the Chief Constable. The door <==
was opened to them by a frightened-looking maid, who gave a little
shriek at sight of them.

“Oh, sir! have you come to say something’s happened to Miss Whittaker?”

Monday—that’s four days back, sir, and she hasn’t come home, nor Miss
Findlater neither, and I’m frightened something’s happened to them. When
I see you, sir, I thought you was the police come to say there had been
an accident. I didn’t know what to do, sir.”

==> “Skipped, by God!” was Parker’s instant thought, but he controlled his <==
annoyance, and asked:

“Do you know where they were going?”

“Crow’s Beach, Miss Whittaker said, sir.”

“Crow’s Beach, Miss Whittaker said, sir.”

“That’s a good fifty miles,” said the Chief Constable. “Probably they’ve
just decided to stay there a day or two.”

==> “More likely gone in the opposite direction,” thought Parker. <==

“They didn’t take no things for the night, sir. They went off about ten
in the morning. They said they was going to have lunch there and come
home in the evening. And Miss Whittaker hasn’t written nor nothing. And
her always so particular. Cook and me, we didn’t know what—”

Constable, you know, and I can soon find out whether there’s been an
accident or anything. But if there had been, depend upon it we should
have heard about it. Come, my girl, pull yourself together, there’s
nothing to cry about. We’ll let you know as soon as we hear anything.”

==> But Sir Charles looked disturbed. Coming on top of Parker’s arrival in <==
the district, the thing had an unpleasant look about it.

Lord Peter received the news cheerfully.

“Good,” said he, “joggle ’em up. Keep ’em moving. That’s the spirit.

Whittaker. No anxiety was expressed by the parlour-maid and none,
apparently, felt. The investigators took care not to arouse any alarm,
and, leaving a trivial and polite message from Sir Charles, withdrew for
a consultation.

==> “There’s nothing for it, so far as I can see,” said Parker, “but an <==
all-stations call to look out for the car and the ladies. And we must
put inquiries through to all the ports, of course. With four days’
start, they may be anywhere by now. I wish to Heaven I’d risked a bit
and started earlier, approval or no approval. What’s this Findlater girl
like? I’d better go back to the house and get photographs of her and the

“It’s an Austin Seven and the number is XX9917,” said Wimsey, much to
the Chief Constable’s surprise. “But I doubt very much whether you’ll
find it at Crow’s Beach, or anywhere near it.”

==> “Well, we’d better get a move on,” snapped Parker. “We’d better <==
separate. How about a spot of lunch in an hour’s time at the George?”

Wimsey was unlucky. Miss Climpson was not to be found. She had had her
lunch early and gone out, saying she felt that a long country walk would
do her good. Mrs. Budge was rather afraid she had had some bad news—she

actually destroyed all the existing portraits she could lay hands on,

of local groups, containing unrecognisable portraits of Miss Whittaker
at church bazaars and private theatricals. She had never had a studio
portrait made in Leahampton.

and the Chief Constable, who was vindicated and triumphant. He had been
telephoning to various country police-stations, and had discovered that
XX9917 had actually been observed on the previous Monday by an A.A.
scout on the road to Crow’s Beach. Having maintained all along that the
Crow’s Beach excursion was a genuine one, he was inclined to exult over
==> the Scotland Yard man. Wimsey and Parker dispiritedly agreed that they <==
had better go down and make inquiries at Crow’s Beach.

Meanwhile, one of the photographers, whose cousin was on the staff of
the _Leahampton Mercury_, had put a call through to the office of that
up-to-date paper, which was just going to press. A stop-press

at Sheffield, at Winchester, at Rugby. Two young women had had tea in a
suspicious manner at Folkestone; a car had passed noisily through
Dorchester at a late hour on Monday night; a dark-haired girl in an
“agitated condition” had entered a public-house in New Alresford just
before closing-time and asked the way to Hazelmere. Among all these
==> reports, Parker selected that of a boy-scout, who reported on the <==
Saturday morning that he had noticed two ladies with a car having a
picnic on the downs on the previous Monday, not far from Shelly Head.
The car was an Austin Seven—he knew that, because he was keen on motors
(an unanswerable reason for accuracy in a boy of his age), and he had
noticed that it was a London number, though he couldn’t say positively

any previous car-tracks, for the chalk was dry and hard, and the grass
and heath retained no marks. Everywhere, little dells and hollows
presented themselves—all exactly alike, and many of them capable of
hiding a small car, not to speak of the mere signs and remains of a
recent picnic. Having arrived at what their guide thought to be
==> approximately the right place, they pulled up and got out. Parker <==
quartered the ground between the five of them and they set off.

Wimsey took a dislike to gorse-bushes that day. There were so many of
them and so thick. Any of them might hold a cigarette package or a
sandwich paper or a scrap of cloth or a clue of some kind. He trudged

gasped. It was ludicrous. He started running again, with the man at his
heels. Presently they were all there, pointing, measuring, taking notes,
grubbing under the gorse-bushes. Wimsey sat down. He was dreadfully
tired.

==> “Peter,” said Parker’s voice, “come and look at this.” <==

He got up wearily.

There were the remains of a picnic lunch a little farther down the

There were the remains of a picnic lunch a little farther down the
hollow. The policeman had a little bag in his hand—he had taken it from
under the body, and was now turning over the trifles it contained. On
the ground, close to the dead girl’s head, was a thick, heavy
spanner—unpleasantly discoloured and with a few fair hairs sticking to
==> its jaws. But what Parker was calling his attention to was none of <==
these, but a man’s mauve-grey cap.

“Where did you find that?” asked Wimsey.

“Alf here picked it up at the top of the hollow,” said Parker.

[line number in individual story] matching line = 7799    window = 7794 7804

its jaws. But what Parker was calling his attention to was none of
these, but a man’s mauve-grey cap.

“Where did you find that?” asked Wimsey.

==> “Alf here picked it up at the top of the hollow,” said Parker. <==

“Tumbled off into the gorse it was,” corroborated the scout, “just up
here, lying upside down just as if it had fallen off somebody’s head.”

“Any footmarks?”

[line number in individual story] matching line = 7812    window = 7807 7817

broken. Looks as if there’d been some sort of struggle. What’s become of
the Austin? Hi! don’t touch that spanner, my lad. There may be
finger-prints on it. This looks like an attack by some gang or other.
Any money in that purse? Ten-shilling note, sixpence and a few
coppers—oh! Well, the other woman may have had more on her. She’s very
==> well off, you know. Held up for ransom, I shouldn’t wonder.” Parker bent <==
down and very gingerly enfolded the spanner in a silk handkerchief,
carrying it slung by the four corners. “Well, we’d better spread about
and have a look for the car. Better try that belt of trees over there.
Looks a likely spot. And, Hopkins—I think you’d better run back with our
car to Crow’s Beach and let ’em know at the station, and come back with

“Yes, thank you, sir.”

The constable went off, taking Alf, who was torn between a desire to
stay and do some more detecting, and the pride and glory of being first
==> back with the news. Parker gave a few words of praise for his valuable <==
assistance which filled him with delight, and then turned to the Chief
Constable.

“They obviously went off in this direction. Would you bear away to the
left, sir, and enter the trees from that end, and Peter, will you bear

left, sir, and enter the trees from that end, and Peter, will you bear
to the right and work through from the other end, while I go straight up
the middle?”

The Chief Constable, who seemed a good deal shaken by the discovery of
==> the body, obeyed without a word. Wimsey caught Parker by the arm. <==

“I say,” he said, “have you looked at the wound? Something funny, isn’t
there? There ought to be more mess, somehow. What do you think?”

“I’m not thinking anything for the moment,” said Parker, a little

[line number in individual story] matching line = 7845    window = 7840 7850

“I say,” he said, “have you looked at the wound? Something funny, isn’t
there? There ought to be more mess, somehow. What do you think?”

==> “I’m not thinking anything for the moment,” said Parker, a little <==
grimly. “We’ll wait for the doctor’s report. Come on, Steve! We want to
dig out that car.”

“Let’s have a look at the cap. H’m. Sold by a gentleman, resident in
Stepney. Almost new. Smells strongly of California Poppy—rather a swell

sort of gangsman, apparently. Quite one of the lads of the village.”

“Yes—we ought to be able to trace that. Thank Heaven, they always
overlook something. Well, we’d better get along.”

==> The search for the car presented no difficulties. Parker stumbled upon <==
it almost as soon as he got in under the trees. There was a clearing,
with a little rivulet of water running through it, beside which stood
the missing Austin. There were other trees here, mingled with the pines,
and the water made an elbow and spread into a shallow pool, with a kind
of muddy beach.

[line number in individual story] matching line = 7863    window = 7858 7868

and the water made an elbow and spread into a shallow pool, with a kind

==> The hood of the car was up, and Parker approached with an uncomfortable <==
feeling that there might be something disagreeable inside, but it was
empty. He tried the gears. They were in neutral and the handbrake was
on. On the seat was a handkerchief—a large linen handkerchief, very
grubby and with no initials or laundry-mark. Parker grunted a little
over the criminal’s careless habit of strewing his belongings about. He

came round in front of the car and received immediate further proof of
carelessness. For on the mud there were footmarks—two men’s and a
woman’s, it seemed.

middle, and led up to where the mark of a Michelin balloon tyre showed
clearly. The tyres of the Austin were ordinary Dunlops—besides, this was
obviously a bigger car. It had apparently stood there for some little
time, for a little pool of engine-oil had dripped from the crank-case.
Then the bigger car had moved off, down a sort of ride that led away
==> through the trees. Parker followed it for a little distance, but the <==
tracks soon became lost in a thick carpet of pine-needles. Still, there
was no other road for a car to take. He turned to the Austin to
investigate further. Presently shouts told him that the other two were
converging upon the centre of the wood. He called back and before long
Wimsey and Sir Charles Pillington came crashing towards him through the

He put his hand down behind the cushions of the car and pulled out an
American magazine—that monthly collection of mystery and sensational
fiction published under the name of _The Black Mask_.

==> “Light reading for the masses,” said Parker. <==

“Brought by the gentleman in the yellow boots, perhaps,” suggested the
Chief Constable.

“More likely by Miss Findlater,” said Wimsey.

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 25864    window = 25859 25869



“Oh, I dunno. From all I hear, Miss Whittaker was dead against
sentimentality and roses round the porch, and the other poor girl copied
her in everything. They might have a boyish taste in fiction.”

==> “Well, it’s not important,” said Parker. <==

“Wait a bit. Look at this. Somebody’s been making marks on it.”

Wimsey held out the cover for inspection. A thick pencil-mark had been
drawn under the first two words of the title.

[line number in individual story] matching line = 7945    window = 7940 7950

here before they transferred her to the other car.”

“Ingenious,” said Sir Charles, “but what does it mean? The Black. It
makes no sense.”

==> “Perhaps the long-toed gentleman was a black man,” suggested Parker. “Or <==
possibly a Hindu or Parsee of sorts.”

“God bless my soul,” said Sir Charles, horrified, “an English girl in
the hands of a black man. How abominable!”

the hands of a black man. How abominable!”

“Well, we’ll hope it isn’t so. Shall we follow the road out or wait for
the doctor to arrive?”

==> “Better go back to the body, I think,” said Parker. “They’ve got a long <==
start of us, and half an hour more or less in following them up won’t
make much odds.”

They turned from the translucent cool greenness of the little wood back
on to the downs. The streamlet clacked merrily away over the pebbles,

it so much more painful, of course. Dear me, how shocking for her poor
parents. And her sisters. They are very agreeable girls; you know them,
of course, Sir Charles. Yes. Tst, tst.”

==> “There is no doubt, I suppose,” said Parker, “that it is Miss <==
Findlater.”

“None whatever,” said Sir Charles.

“Well, as you can identify her, it may be possible to spare the

ventured, “it looks as though the face had been roughened or burnt about
the nose and lips. Yet there is no appearance of the kind on the bridge
of the nose, neck or forehead. Tst, tst—otherwise I should have put it
down to severe sunburn.”

==> “How about chloroform burns?” suggested Parker. <==

“Tst, tst,” said the doctor, annoyed at not having thought of this
himself—“I wish you gentlemen of the police force would not be quite so
abrupt. You want everything decided in too great a hurry. I was about to
remark—if you had not anticipated me—that since I could _not_ put the

knowledge?”

“Certainly not,” said Wimsey, “but as you say, it is unwise to make any
medical pronouncement without cautious investigation.”

==> “And this is not the place for it,” put in Parker, hastily. “I think we <==
have done all there is to do here. Will you go with the body to the
mortuary, doctor. Mr. Andrews, I shall be obliged if you will come and
take a few photographs of some footmarks and so on up in the wood. The
light is bad, I’m afraid, but we must do our best.”


[line number in individual story] matching line = 8060    window = 8055 8065

opinion. In the meantime, we had better let it be supposed that we
accept the surface explanation of all this.”

“What is the difficulty?” asked Sir Charles, curiously.

==> “Oh, nothing much,” replied Parker. “All the appearances are in favour <==
of the girls having been attacked by a couple of ruffians, who have
carried Miss Whittaker off with a view to ransom, after brutally
knocking Miss Findlater on the head when she offered resistance.
Probably that is the true explanation. Any minor discrepancies will
doubtless clear themselves up in time. We shall know better when we have

doubtless clear themselves up in time. We shall know better when we have
had a proper medical examination.”

They returned to the wood, where photographs were taken and careful
measurements made of the footprints. The Chief Constable followed these
==> activities with intense interest, looking over Parker’s shoulder as he <==
entered the particulars in his notebook.

“I say,” he said, suddenly, “isn’t it rather odd—”

“Here’s somebody coming,” broke in Parker.

The sound of a motor-cycle being urged in second gear over the rough
ground proved to be the herald of a young man armed with a camera.

“Oh, God!” groaned Parker. “The damned Press already.”

He received the journalist courteously enough, showing him the
wheel-tracks and the footprints, and outlining the kidnapping theory as
they walked back to the place where the body was found.

they walked back to the place where the body was found.

“Can you give us any idea, Inspector, of the appearance of the two
wanted men?”

==> “Well,” said Parker, “one of them appears to be something of a dandy; he <==
wears a loathsome mauve cap and narrow pointed shoes, and, if those
marks on the magazine cover mean anything, one or other of the men may
possibly be a coloured man of some kind. Of the second man, all we can
definitely say is that he wears number 10 shoes, with rubber heels.”

definitely say is that he wears number 10 shoes, with rubber heels.”

“I was going to say,” said Pillington, “that, à propos de bottes, it is
rather remarkable—”

==> “And this is where we found the body of Miss Findlater,” went on Parker, <==
ruthlessly. He described the injuries and the position of the body, and
the journalist gratefully occupied himself with taking photographs,
including a group of Wimsey, Parker and the Chief Constable standing
among the gorse-bushes, while the latter majestically indicated the
fatal spot with his walking-stick.

“buzz off, won’t you, and tell the rest of the boys. You’ve got all we
can tell you, and we’ve got other things to do beyond granting special
interviews.”

The reporter asked no better. This was tantamount to making his

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 26048    window = 26043 26053


The reporter asked no better. This was tantamount to making his
information exclusive, and no Victorian matron could have a more
delicate appreciation of the virtues of exclusiveness than a modern
newspaper man.

==> “Well now, Sir Charles,” said Parker, when the man had happily chugged <==
and popped himself away, “what were you about to say in the matter of
the footprints?”

But Sir Charles was offended. The Scotland Yard man had snubbed him and
thrown doubt on his discretion.

unthinkably sinister, by a black man—aroused all the passion of horror
and indignation of which the English temperament is capable. Reporters
swarmed down upon Crow’s Beach like locusts—the downs near Shelly Head
were like a fair with motors, bicycles and parties on foot, rushing out
to spend a happy week-end amid surroundings of mystery and bloodshed.
==> Parker, who with Wimsey had taken rooms at the Green Lion, sat answering <==
the telephone and receiving the letters and wires which descended upon
him from all sides, with a stalwart policeman posted at the end of the
passage to keep out all intruders.

Wimsey fidgeted about the room, smoking cigarette after cigarette in his

“I knew it. She’s been doing the jobs while the Whittaker woman held
down her alibi in Kent. For God’s sake, Charles, make no mistake.
Nobody’s life is safe for a second while either of them is at large.”

==> “When a woman is wicked and unscrupulous,” said Parker, sententiously, <==
“she is the most ruthless criminal in the world—fifty times worse than a
man, because she is always so much more single-minded about it.”

“They’re not troubled with sentimentality, that’s why,” said Wimsey,
“and we poor mutts of men stuff ourselves up with the idea that they’re

“They’re not troubled with sentimentality, that’s why,” said Wimsey,
“and we poor mutts of men stuff ourselves up with the idea that they’re
romantic and emotional. All punk, my son. Damn that ’phone!”

==> Parker snatched up the receiver. <==

“Yes—yes—speaking. Good God, you don’t say so. All right. Yes. Yes, of
course you must detain him. I think myself it’s a plant, but he must be
held and questioned. And see that all the papers have it. Tell ’em
you’re sure he’s the man. See? Soak it well into ’em that that’s the

“I’m glad to hear that. Sit down and tell us all about it.”

“I’ll be as brief as possible,” said the doctor. He was a London man,
sent down by Scotland Yard, and accustomed to police work—a lean, grey
badger of a man, business-like and keen-eyed, the direct opposite of the
==> “tutster” who had annoyed Parker the evening before. <==

“Well, first of all, the blow on the head had, of course, nothing
whatever to do with the death. You saw yourself that there had been next
to no bleeding. The wound was inflicted some time after death—no doubt
to create the impression of an attack by a gang. Similarly with the cuts

“Yes, I think it was. The burns on the face certainly suggest it.”

“That would also account for the handkerchief found in the car,” said
Wimsey.

==> “I suppose,” pursued Parker, “that it would require considerable <==
strength and determination to administer chloroform to a strong young
woman. She would probably resist strenuously.”

“She would,” said the doctor, grimly, “But the odd thing is, she didn’t.
As I said before, all the marks of violence were inflicted post-mortem.”

semi-conscious and then could be more firmly dealt with. It is quite
possible, I suppose, that she fell asleep in the sunshine, while her
companion wandered off and was kidnapped, and that the kidnappers then
came along and got rid of Miss Findlater.”

==> “That seems a little unnecessary,” said Parker. “Why come back to her at <==
all?”

“Do you suggest that they both fell asleep and were both set on and
chloroformed at the same time? It sounds rather unlikely.”


[line number in individual story] matching line = 8294    window = 8289 8299

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 26227    window = 26222 26232


chloroformed at the same time? It sounds rather unlikely.”

He outlined the history of their suspicions about Mary Whittaker, to
which the doctor listened in horrified amazement.

==> “What happened,” said Parker, “as we think, is this. We think that for <==
some reason Miss Whittaker had determined to get rid of this poor girl
who was so devoted to her. She arranged that they should go off for a
picnic and that it should be known where they were going to. Then, when
Vera Findlater was dozing in the sunshine, our theory is that she
murdered her—either with chloroform or—more likely, I fancy—by the same

“You’ve proved your point,” he said at length. “I consider that
absolutely convincing.”

“It struck even Sir Charles Pillington, who is none too bright,” said
==> Parker. “I had the greatest difficulty in preventing him from blurting <==
out the extraordinary agreement of the measurements to that _Evening
Views_ man.”

“You think, then, that Miss Whittaker had come provided with these shoes
and produced the tracks herself.”

[line number in individual story] matching line = 8431    window = 8426 8436

coal. The other deaths were returned natural deaths at the inquest. And
as for Miss Findlater—even if we show it to be chloroform—well,
chloroform isn’t difficult stuff to get hold of—it’s not arsenic or
cyanide. And even if there were finger-prints on the spanner—”

==> “There were not,” said Parker, gloomily. “This girl knows what she’s <==
about.”

“What did she want to kill Vera Findlater for, anyway?” asked the
doctor, suddenly. “According to you, the girl was the most valuable bit
of evidence she had. She was the one witness who could prove that Miss

the gang story all over the front page this morning, and a patriotic
leader about the danger of encouraging coloured aliens. I needn’t remind
you that the _Wire_ would be ready to corrupt the Archangel Gabriel in
order to kill the _Yell’s_ story.”

==> “Oh, hell!” said Parker, rushing to the window. <==

“Too late,” said the doctor. “The _Wire_ man has vanished into the post
office. Of course, you can ’phone up and try to stop it.”

Parker did so, and was courteously assured by the editor of the _Wire_

The editor of the _Wire_ was speaking the exact truth. The story had

of a Murder?

Whenever she thought of the word, it wrote itself upon her brain in
large capitals, heavily underlined. MURDER—like a police-bill.

particular feelings about the sacred secrecy of the Confessional. He had
a Protestant appearance—or possibly he thought nothing of religion one
way or the other. In any case, he would put his professional duty before
everything. Why not send him the paper, without reading it, briefly
explaining how she had come upon it? Then the responsibility would be

may I be forgiven.”

With a red flush creeping over her cheeks as though she were stripping
something naked, she turned her attention to the paper.

==> The jottings were brief and ambiguous. Parker might not have made much <==
of them, but to Miss Climpson, trained in this kind of devotional
shorthand, the story was clear as print.

“Jealousy”—the word was written large and underlined. Then there was a
reference to a quarrel, to wicked accusations and angry words and to a

her brain.

So she started off, missing Lord Peter by a quarter of an hour, and took
the train to Guildford and then walked and had lunch in a wayside
tea-shop and walked back into Guildford and so came home, where she
==> learnt that “Mr. Parker and ever so many gentlemen had been asking for <==
her all day, and what a dreadful thing, miss, here was Miss Whittaker
and Miss Findlater disappeared and the police out looking for them, and
them motor-cars was such dangerous things, miss, wasn’t they? It was to
be hoped there wasn’t an accident.”

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 26696    window = 26691 26701


she could hardly have explained even to herself, to go and look at South
Audley Street. What she was to do when she got there she did not know,
but go there she must. It was the old reluctance to make open use of
that confession paper. Vera Findlater’s story at first hand—that was the
idea to which she obscurely clung. So she took the first train to
==> Waterloo, leaving behind her, in case Wimsey or Parker should call <==
again, a letter so obscure and mysterious and so lavishly underlined and
interlined that it was perhaps fortunate for their reason that they were
never faced with it.

In Piccadilly she saw Bunter, and learned that his lordship was at

again, a letter so obscure and mysterious and so lavishly underlined and
interlined that it was perhaps fortunate for their reason that they were
never faced with it.

In Piccadilly she saw Bunter, and learned that his lordship was at
==> Crow’s Beach with Mr. Parker, where he, Bunter, was just off to join <==
him. Miss Climpson promptly charged him with a message to his employer
slightly more involved and mysterious than her letter, and departed for
South Audley Street. It was only when she was walking up it that she
realised how vague her quest was and how little investigation one can do
by merely walking along a street. Also, it suddenly occurred to her that

[line number in individual story] matching line = 8858    window = 8853 8863

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 26791    window = 26786 26796


story of Vera Findlater’s death.


Sunday was the most awful day Miss Climpson had ever spent. An active
woman, she was condemned to inactivity, and she had time to brood over
==> the tragedy. Not having Wimsey’s or Parker’s inside knowledge, she took <==
the kidnapping story at its face value. In a sense, she found it
comforting, for she was able to acquit Mary Whittaker of any share in
this or the previous murders. She put them down—except, of course, in
the case of Miss Dawson, and that might never have been a murder after
all—to the mysterious man in South Audley Street. She formed a nightmare

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 26804    window = 26799 26809


Climpson’s credit be it said that she never for one moment faltered in
her determination to track the monster to his lurking-place.

She wrote a long letter to Lord Peter, detailing her plans. Bunter, she
knew, had left 110A Piccadilly, so, after considerable thought, she
==> addressed it to Lord Peter Wimsey, c/o Inspector Parker, The <==
Police-Station, Crow’s Beach. There was, of course, no Sunday post from
Town. However, it would go with the midnight collection.

On the Monday morning she set out early, in her old clothes and her
spectacles, for South Audley Street. Never had her natural

police inquiry, he never thought to go back to Leahampton. Bunter had
duly arrived with “Mrs. Merdle” on the Saturday evening. Immense police
activity was displayed in the neighbourhood of the downs, and at
Southampton and Portsmouth, in order to foster the idea that the
authorities supposed the “gang” to be lurking in those districts.
==> Nothing, as a matter of fact, was farther from Parker’s thoughts. “Let <==
her think she is safe,” he said, “and she’ll come back. It’s the
cat-and-mouse act for us, old man.” Wimsey fretted. He wanted the
analysis of the body to be complete and loathed the thought of the long
days he had to wait. And he had small hope of the result.

“It’s all very well sitting round with your large disguised policemen
outside Mrs. Forrest’s flat,” he said irritably, over the bacon and eggs
on Monday morning, “but you do realise, don’t you, that we’ve still got
no proof of murder. Not in one single case.”

==> “That’s so,” replied Parker, placidly. <==

“Well, doesn’t it make your blood boil?” said Wimsey.

“Hardly,” said Parker. “This kind of thing happens too often. If my
blood boiled every time there was a delay in getting evidence, I should

“That’s so,” replied Parker, placidly.

“Well, doesn’t it make your blood boil?” said Wimsey.

==> “Hardly,” said Parker. “This kind of thing happens too often. If my <==
blood boiled every time there was a delay in getting evidence, I should
be in a perpetual fever. Why worry? It may be that perfect crime you’re
so fond of talking about—the one that leaves no trace. You ought to be
charmed with it.”

at that and not tried to cover it up. If you notice, the deaths are
becoming more and more violent, elaborate and unlikely in appearance.
Telephone again. If the Post Office accounts don’t show a handsome
profit on telephones this year it won’t be your fault.”

==> “It’s the cap and shoes,” said Parker, mildly. “They’ve traced them. <==
They were ordered from an outfitter’s in Stepney, to be sent to the Rev.
H. Dawson, Peveril Hotel, Bloomsbury, to await arrival.”

“The Peveril again!”

a double purpose? Besides making it look like the work of a gang, could
they be hiding some other, smaller mark? Poison, for instance, could be
injected, and the mark covered up by scratches and cuts inflicted after
death.”

==> “Frankly,” said Parker, “I wish I could think it. It’s a very sound idea <==
and may be the right one. Our trouble is, that in the two previous
deaths which we have been investigating, and which we are inclined to
think form a part of the same series as this one, there have been no
signs or traces of poison discoverable in the bodies at all by any
examination or analysis that skill can devise. In fact, not only no

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 27074    window = 27069 27079



“Odd,” said the doctor. “And you think this may turn out the same way.
Still, in this case the death can’t very well have been natural—or why
these elaborate efforts to cover it up?”

==> “It wasn’t,” said Parker; “the proof being that—as we now know—the plot <==
was laid nearly two months ago.”

“But the method!” cried Wimsey, “the method! Hang it all—here are all we
people with our brilliant brains and our professional reputations—and
this half-trained girl out of a hospital can beat the lot of us. How was

people with our brilliant brains and our professional reputations—and
this half-trained girl out of a hospital can beat the lot of us. How was
it done?”

“It’s probably something so simple and obvious that it’s never occurred
==> to us,” said Parker. “The sort of principle you learn when you’re in the <==
fourth form and never apply to anything. Rudimentary. Like that
motor-cycling imbecile we met up at Crofton, who sat in the rain and
prayed for help because he’d never heard of an air-lock in his feed. Now
I daresay that boy had learnt—What’s the matter with you?”

things, upsetting his cup. “My God! But that’s it! You’ve got it—you’ve
done it—Obvious? God Almighty—it doesn’t need a doctor. A garage hand
could have told you. People die of it every day. Of course, it was an
air-lock in the feed.”

==> “Bear up, doctor,” said Parker, “he’s always like this when he gets an <==
idea. It wears off in time. D’you mind explaining yourself, old thing?”

Wimsey’s pallid face was flushed. He turned on the doctor.

“Look here,” he said, “the body’s a pumping engine, isn’t it? The jolly

you say. And what would be the post-mortem symptoms?”

“None. Just the appearances of heart failure. And, of course, the little
mark of the needle, if you happened to be looking for it.”

==> “You’re sure of all this, doctor?” said Parker. <==

“Well, it’s simple, isn’t it? A plain problem in mechanics. Of course
that would happen. It must happen.”

“Could it be proved?” insisted Parker.

“We must try,” said Parker. “It’s ingenious, and it explains a lot of

“Naturally. Take you up in the car. Lose no time. Ring the bell for
Bunter, would you? Oh, Bunter, we’re going up to Town. How soon can we
start?”

should be necessary.”

“Good man.”

“Oh, thanks. Ah, yes. The finger-prints off the cheque. H’m. Two sets
only—besides those of the cashier, of course—Cousin Hallelujah’s and a
female set, presumably those of Mary Whittaker. Yes, obviously—here are
the four fingers of the left hand, just as one would place them to hold

They reached Town at twelve—owing to Wimsey’s brisk work at the
wheel—and went straight to Scotland Yard, dropping Bunter, at his own
request, as he was anxious to return to the flat. They found the Chief
Commissioner in rather a brusque mood—angry with the _Banner_ and
==> annoyed with Parker for having failed to muzzle Pillington. <==

“God knows where she will be found next. She’s probably got a disguise
and a get-away all ready.”

“Probably gone already,” said Wimsey. “She could easily have left

“Probably gone already,” said Wimsey. “She could easily have left
England on the Monday or Tuesday and nobody a penny the wiser. If the
coast had seemed clear, she’d have come back and taken possession of her
goods again. Now she’ll stay abroad. That’s all.”

==> “I’m very much afraid you’re right,” agreed Parker, gloomily. <==

“Meanwhile, what is Mrs. Forrest doing?”

“Behaving quite normally. She’s been carefully shadowed, of course, but
not interfered with in any way. We’ve got three men out there now—one as

your eyes on these two photographs?”

“Finger-prints?” said the chief, interrogatively.

“One of them is our own official photograph of the prints on the £10,000
==> cheque,” said Parker. “The other—where did you get this, Bunter? It <==
looks like the same set of prints, but it’s not one of ours.”

“They appeared similar, sir, to my uninstructed eye. I thought it better
to place the matter before you.”

“So I understood you to say, my lord, and I have filed them under that
name.”

“Then, if the signature on the cheque is genuine—”

==> “We haven’t far to look for our bird,” said Parker, brutally. “A double <==
identity; damn the woman, she’s made us waste a lot of time. Well, I
think we shall get her now, on the Findlater murder at least, and
possibly on the Gotobed business.”

“But I understood there was an alibi for that,” said the Chief.

think we shall get her now, on the Findlater murder at least, and
possibly on the Gotobed business.”

“But I understood there was an alibi for that,” said the Chief.

==> “There was,” said Parker, grimly, “but the witness was the girl that’s <==
just been murdered. Looks as though she had made up her mind to split
and was got rid of.”

“Looks as though several people had had a near squeak of it,” said
Wimsey.

“Why not? You may be useful. With the men we’ve got there already we
shan’t need any extra help.”

The car whizzed swiftly through Pall Mall, up St. James’s Street and
along Piccadilly. Half-way up South Audley Street they passed the
==> fruit-seller, with whom Parker exchanged an almost imperceptible signal. <==
A few doors below the entrance to the flats they got out and were almost
immediately joined by the hall-porter’s sporting friend.

“I was just going out to call you up,” said the latter. “She’s arrived.”

“Is Forrest there too?”

“Yes. She came in just before the other woman.”

==> “Queer,” said Parker. “Another good theory gone west. Are you sure it’s <==
Whittaker?”

“Well, she’s made up with old-fashioned clothes and greyish hair and so
on. But she’s the right height and general appearance. And she’s running
the old blue spectacle stunt again. I think it’s the right one—though of

ear to the door.

“Charles,” he cried suddenly, “there’s something going on here.” His
face was white. “Be quick! I couldn’t stand _another_—!”

==> Parker hastened up and listened. Then he caught Peter’s stick and <==
hammered on the door, so that the hollow liftshaft echoed with the
clamour.

“Come on there—open the door—this is the police.”

crash, as though a piece of furniture had been flung to the floor—and
then a loud hoarse scream, cut brutally off in the middle.

“Break in the door,” said Wimsey, the sweat pouring down his face.

==> Parker signalled to the heavier of the two policemen. He came along, <==
shoulder first, lunging. The door shook and cracked. They stamped and
panted in the narrow space.

The door gave way, and they tumbled into the hall. Everything was
ominously quiet.

nothing there. They sprang to the sitting-room door and pushed it. It
opened about a foot. Something bulky impeded its progress. They shoved
violently and the obstacle gave. Wimsey leapt over it—it was a tall
cabinet, fallen, with broken china strewing the floor. The room bore
signs of a violent struggle—tables flung down, a broken chair, a smashed
==> lamp. He dashed for the bedroom, with Parker hard at his heels. <==

The body of a woman lay limply on the bed. Her long, grizzled hair hung
in a dark rope over the pillow and blood was on her head and throat. But
the blood was running freely, and Wimsey could have shouted for joy at
the sight. Dead men do not bleed.

hesitated for a moment and she saw it.

“On what charge? What have you got against me?”

“The old fool!” she said, contemptuously, “she forced her way in here
and attacked me. Is that all?”

“Very probably not,” said Parker. “I warn you that anything you say may

Indeed, the third officer had already produced a notebook and was
imperturbably writing down: “When told the charge, the prisoner said ‘Is
that all?’” The remark evidently struck him as an injudicious one, for

of the situation.

“It’s Miss Climpson—God knows how she got here. I think she’s all right,
but she’s had a rough time.”

“Now, don’t worry, Miss Climpson,” said Wimsey, much relieved,
“everything’s quite all right and you mustn’t talk. You must tell us
about it later.”

==> “What was that about a syringe?” said Parker, intent on his case. <==

“She’d got a syringe in her hand,” panted Miss Climpson, trying to sit
up, and fumbling with her hands over the bed. “I fainted, I think—such a
struggle—and something hit me on the head. And I saw her coming at me
with the thing. And I knocked it out of her hand and I can’t remember

with the thing. And I knocked it out of her hand and I can’t remember
what happened afterwards. But I have _remarkable_ vitality,” said Miss
Climpson, cheerfully. “My dear father always used to say ‘Climpsons take
a lot of killing’!”

==> Parker was groping on the floor. <==

“Here you are,” said he. In his hand was a hypodermic syringe.

“She’s mental, that’s what she is,” said the prisoner. “That’s only the
hypodermic I use for my injections when I get neuralgia. There’s nothing

“There is—nothing in it.”
