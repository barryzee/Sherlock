                                         TROYTE _On Change-Ringing_.

==> "That's torn it!" said Lord Peter Wimsey. <==

The car lay, helpless and ridiculous, her nose deep in the ditch, her
back wheels cocked absurdly up on the bank, as though she were doing her
best to bolt to earth and were scraping herself a burrow beneath the
drifted snow. Peering through a flurry of driving flakes, Wimsey saw how

"That's torn it!" said Lord Peter Wimsey.

The car lay, helpless and ridiculous, her nose deep in the ditch, her
back wheels cocked absurdly up on the bank, as though she were doing her
best to bolt to earth and were scraping herself a burrow beneath the
==> drifted snow. Peering through a flurry of driving flakes, Wimsey saw how <==
the accident had come about. The narrow, hump-backed bridge, blind as an
eyeless beggar, spanned the dark drain at right angles, dropping plump
down upon the narrow road that crested the dyke. Coming a trifle too
fast across the bridge, blinded by the bitter easterly snowstorm, he had
overshot the road and plunged down the side of the dyke into the deep

Right and left, before and behind, the fen lay shrouded. It was past
four o'clock and New Year's Eve; the snow that had fallen all day gave
back a glimmering greyness to a sky like lead.

==> "I'm sorry," said Wimsey. "Whereabouts do you suppose we've got to, <==
Bunter?"

The manservant consulted a map in the ray of an electric torch.

"I think, my lord, we must have run off the proper road at Leamholt.

Unless I am much mistaken, we must be near Fenchurch St. Paul."

As he spoke, the sound of a church clock, muffled by the snow, came
borne upon the wind; it chimed the first quarter.

==> "Thank God!" said Wimsey. "Where there is a church, there is <==
civilisation. We'll have to walk it. Never mind the suitcases; we can
send somebody for them. Br'rh! it's cold. I bet that when Kingsley
welcomed the wild northeaster he was sitting indoors by a good fire,
eating muffins. I could do with a muffin myself. Next time I accept
hospitality in the Fen-country, I'll take care that it's at midsummer,

"Fenchurch St. Paul."

There was no other direction; ahead, road and dyke marched on side by
side into an eternity of winter.

==> "Fenchurch St. Paul for us," said Wimsey. He led the way into the <==
side-road, and as he did so, they heard the clock again--nearer--chiming
the third quarter.

A few hundred yards of solitude, and they came upon the first sign of
life in this frozen desolation: on their left, the roofs of a farm,

[line number in individual story] matching line = 84    window = 79 89

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 92061    window = 92056 92066


building like a box of bricks, whose sign, creaking in the blast,
proclaimed it to be the Wheatsheaf public-house. In front of it stood a
small, shabby car, and from windows on the ground and first floors light
shone behind red blinds.

==> Wimsey went up to it and tried the door. It was shut, but not locked. He <==
called out, "Anybody about?"

A middle-aged woman emerged from an inner room.

"We're not open yet," she began, abruptly.

A middle-aged woman emerged from an inner room.

"We're not open yet," she began, abruptly.

==> "I beg your pardon," said Wimsey. "Our car has come to grief. Can you <==
direct us----?"

"Oh, I'm sorry, sir. I thought you were some of the men. Your car broke
down? That's bad. Come in. I'm afraid we're all in a muddle----"

"What's the trouble, Mrs. Tebbutt?" The voice was gentle and scholarly,
==> and, as Wimsey followed the woman into a small parlour, he saw that the <==
speaker was an elderly parson.

"The gentlemen have had an accident with their car."

"Oh, dear," said the clergyman. "Such a terrible day, too! Can I be of

"The gentlemen have had an accident with their car."

"Oh, dear," said the clergyman. "Such a terrible day, too! Can I be of
any assistance?"

ropes and haulage to get it back to the road again.

"Dear, dear," said the clergyman again. "That would be coming over
Frog's Bridge, I expect. A most dangerous place, especially in the dark.
We must see what can be done about it. Let me give you a lift into the

"Not at all, not at all. I am just getting back to my tea. I am sure you
must be wanting something to warm you up. I trust you are not in a hurry
to reach your destination. We should be delighted to put you up for the
night."

==> Wimsey thanked him very much, but said he did not want to trespass upon <==
his hospitality.

"It will be a great pleasure," said the clergyman, courteously. "We see
so little company here that I assure you you will be doing my wife and
myself a great favour."

"Excellent, excellent."

"I'm really most grateful. Even if we could get the car out to-night,
I'm afraid the axle may be bent, and that means a blacksmith's job. But

parish."

"It's extremely good of you, Mr. Venables. If we're really not putting
you out, we will accept your invitation with pleasure. My name is

The Rector fumbled for his glasses, which, after disentangling the cord,
he perched very much askew on his long nose, in order to peer at
Wimsey's card.

"Lord Peter Wimsey--just so. Dear me! The name seems familiar. Have I

"Tell him to keep his spirits up. Such a nasty, depressing complaint.
But he's over the worst now. I will send a little bottle of port wine as
soon as he is able to take it. Tuke Holdsworth '08," added the Rector,

Well! We really must be going. I'm afraid my car is not much to boast
of, but there's more room in it than one would think. Many's the

The ancient car, shuddering to her marrow-bones, lurched away down the
straight and narrow road. They passed a cottage, and then, quite
suddenly, on their right, there loomed out of the whirling snow a grey,
gigantic bulk.

==> "Great Heavens!" exclaimed Wimsey, "is that your church?" <==

"Yes, indeed," said the Rector, with pride. "You find it impressive?"

"Impressive!" said Wimsey. "Why, it's like a young cathedral. I'd no
idea. How big is your parish, then?"

"You'll be surprised when I tell you," said the Rector, with a chuckle.
"Three hundred and forty souls--no more. Astonishing, is it not? But you
find the same thing all over the Fens. East Anglia is famous for the

size and splendour of its parish churches. Still, we flatter ourselves
we are almost unique, even in this part of the world. It was an abbey
foundation, and in the old days Fenchurch St. Paul must have been quite
an important place. How high should you say our tower was?"

==> Wimsey gazed up at the great pile. <==

"It's difficult to tell in this darkness. Not less than a hundred and
thirty feet, surely."

"Not a bad guess. A hundred and twenty-eight, to be exact, to the top of

dear, I am sorry to be a little behind time, but I have brought a guest
back with me. He has had an accident with his car and will stay the
night with us. The rug! Allow me! I fear that seat is something of a
_res angusta_. Pray be careful of your head. Ah! all is well. My

Mrs. Venables, a plump and placid figure in the lamplight from the open
door, received the invasion with competent tranquillity.

"How fortunate that my husband should have met you. An accident? I do

"How fortunate that my husband should have met you. An accident? I do
hope you are not hurt. I always say these roads are perfect
death-traps."

==> "Thank you," said Wimsey. "There is no harm done, We stupidly ran off <==
the road--at Frog's Bridge, I understand."

"A very nasty place--quite a mercy you didn't go into the Thirty-foot
Drain. Do come in and sit down and get yourselves warm. Your man? Yes,
of course. Emily! Take this gentleman's manservant into the kitchen and

"And tell Hinkins to take the car and go down to Frog's Bridge for the
luggage," added the Rector. "He will find Lord Peter's car there. He had
better go at once, before the weather gets worse. And, Emily! tell him
to send over to Wilderspin and arrange to get the car out of the dyke."

==> "To-morrow morning will do for that," said Wimsey. <==

"To be sure. First thing to-morrow morning. Wilderspin is the
blacksmith--an excellent fellow. He will see to the matter most
competently. Dear me, yes! And now, come in, come in! We want our tea,
Agnes, my dear, have you explained to Emily that Lord Peter will be

Theodore, you have not caught cold."

"No, no, my dear. I have been well wrapped up. Dear me, yes! Ha! What do
I see? Muffins?"

==> "I was just wishing for muffins," said Wimsey. <==

"Sit down, sit down and make a good meal. I'm sure you must be famished.
I have seldom known such bitter weather. Would you prefer a
whisky-and-soda, perhaps?"

"Sit down, sit down and make a good meal. I'm sure you must be famished.
I have seldom known such bitter weather. Would you prefer a
whisky-and-soda, perhaps?"

Venables, it's tremendously good of you to take pity upon us."

"I'm only so glad to be able to help," said Mrs. Venables, smiling
cheerfully. "Really, I don't think there's anything to equal the
dreariness of these fen roads in winter. It's most fortunate your

"I'm only so glad to be able to help," said Mrs. Venables, smiling
cheerfully. "Really, I don't think there's anything to equal the
dreariness of these fen roads in winter. It's most fortunate your
accident landed you comparatively close to the village."

==> "It is indeed." Wimsey gratefully took in the cosy sitting-room, with <==
its little tables crowded with ornaments, its fire roaring behind a
chaste canopy of velvet overmantel, and the silver tea-vessel winking
upon the polished tray. "I feel like Ulysses, come to port after much
storm and peril."

"I'm sure we ought," said Mrs. Venables. "My husband has asked you to
stay the night, Lord Peter, but he ought to have mentioned that you will
probably get very little sleep, being so close to the church. But
perhaps you do not mind the sound of bells."

==> "Not at all," said Wimsey. <==

"My husband is a very keen change-ringer," pursued Mrs. Venables, "and,
as this is New Year's Eve----"

The Rector, who seldom allowed anybody else to finish a sentence, broke

"We hope to accomplish a real feat to-night," he said, "or rather, I
should say, to-morrow morning. We intend to ring the New Year in
with--you are not, perhaps, aware that we possess here one of the finest
rings in the country?"

==> "Indeed?" said Wimsey. "Yes, I believe I have heard of the Fenchurch <==
bells."

"There are, perhaps, a few heavier rings," said the Rector, "but I
hardly know where you would rival us for fullness and sweetness of tone.
Number seven, in particular, is a most noble old bell, and so is the

history of the bells. The tenor, Tailor Paul, was actually cast in a
field next the churchyard in the year 1614. You can still see the
depression in the earth where the mould was made, and the field itself
is called the Bell-Field to this day."

==> "And have you a good set of ringers?" inquired Wimsey, politely. <==

"Very good indeed. Excellent fellows and most enthusiastic. That reminds
me. I was about to say that we have arranged to ring the New Year in
to-night with no less," said the Rector, emphatically, "no less than
fifteen thousand, eight hundred and forty Kent Treble Bob Majors. What

me. I was about to say that we have arranged to ring the New Year in
to-night with no less," said the Rector, emphatically, "no less than
fifteen thousand, eight hundred and forty Kent Treble Bob Majors. What
do you think of that? Not bad, eh?"

==> "Bless my heart!" said Wimsey. "Fifteen thousand----" <==

"Eight hundred and forty," said the Rector.

Wimsey made a rapid calculation.


[line number in individual story] matching line = 353    window = 348 358

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 92330    window = 92325 92335



"Bless my heart!" said Wimsey. "Fifteen thousand----"

"Eight hundred and forty," said the Rector.

==> Wimsey made a rapid calculation. <==

"A good many hours' work there."

"Nine hours," said the Rector, with relish.


[line number in individual story] matching line = 359    window = 354 364

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 92336    window = 92331 92341



"A good many hours' work there."

"Nine hours," said the Rector, with relish.

==> "Well done, sir," said Wimsey. "Why, that's equal to the great <==
performance of the College Youths in eighteen hundred and something."

"In 1868," agreed the Rector. "That is what we aim to emulate. And,
what's more, but for the little help I can give, we shall be obliged to
do as well as they did, and ring the whole peal with eight ringers only.

[line number in individual story] matching line = 371    window = 366 376

been laid low by this terrible influenza, and we can get no help from
Fenchurch St. Stephen (which has a ring of bells, though not equal to
ours) because there they have no Treble Bob ringers and confine
themselves to Grandsire Triples."

==> Wimsey shook his head, and helped himself to his fourth muffin. <==

"Grandsire Triples are most venerable," he said solemnly, "but you can
never get the same music----"

"That's what I say," crowed the Rector. "You never can get the same

music when the tenor is rung behind--not even with Stedman's, though we
are very fond here of Stedman's and ring them, I venture to say, very
well. But for interest and variety and for sweetness in the peal, give
me Kent Treble Bob every time."

==> "Quite right, sir," said Wimsey. <==

"You will never beat it," said Mr. Venables, soaring away happily to the
heights of the belfry, and waving his muffin in the air, so that the
butter ran down his cuff. "Take even Grandsire Major--I cannot help
feeling it as a defect that the blows come behind so monotonously at the

Ah, well! Man proposes and God disposes--unless"--the Rector turned
suddenly and looked at his guest--"you were speaking just now with a
good deal of feeling about Treble Bob--you are not, yourself, by any
chance, a ringer?"

==> "Well," said Wimsey, "I used at one time to pull quite a pretty rope. <==
But whether, at this time of day----"

"Treble Bob?" inquired the Rector, eagerly.

"Treble Bob, certainly. But it's some time since----"

ring on the handbells. My dear, I am afraid we shall have to monopolise
the dining-room, if you don't mind. Emily, tell Hinkins that I have here
a gentleman who can ring the peal with us and I want him to go round
immediately----"

==> "One moment, Emily. Theodore, is it quite fair to ask Lord Peter Wimsey, <==
after a motor accident, and at the end of a tiring day, to stay up
ringing bells from midnight to nine o'clock? A short peal, perhaps, if
he really does not mind, but even so, are we not demanding rather a lot
of his good nature?"

==> The Rector's mouth drooped like the mouth of a hurt child, and Wimsey <==
hastened to his support.

"Not in the least, Mrs. Venables. Nothing would please me more than to
ring bells all day and all night. I am not tired at all. I really don't
need rest. I would far rather ring bells. The only thing that worries me

"Of course you will, of course you will," said the Rector, hurriedly.
"But as my wife says--really, I am afraid I am being very thoughtless.
Nine hours is too much. We ought to confine ourselves to five thousand
changes or so----"

==> "Not a bit of it," said Wimsey. "Nine hours or nothing. I insist upon <==
it. Probably, once you have heard my efforts, it will be nothing."

"Pooh! nonsense!" cried the Rector. "Emily, tell Hinkins to get the
ringers together here by--shall we say half-past six? I think they can
all be here by then, except possibly Pratt, who lives up at Tupper's

"It is very good of you to indulge my husband's hobby," said Mrs.
Venables; "this occasion has meant so much to him, and he has had so
many disappointments about it. But it seems dreadful to offer you
hospitality and then keep you hard at work all night."

==> Wimsey again assured her that the pleasure was entirely his. <==

"I shall insist on your getting a few hours' rest at least," was all
Mrs. Venables could say. "Will you come up now and see your room? You
will like a wash and brush-up at any rate. We will have supper at 7.30,
if we can get my husband to release you by then, and after that, you

will like a wash and brush-up at any rate. We will have supper at 7.30,
if we can get my husband to release you by then, and after that, you
really must go and lie down for a nap. I have put you in here--I see
your man has everything ready for you."

==> "Well, Bunter," said Wimsey, when Mrs. Venables had departed, leaving <==
him to make himself presentable by the inadequate light of a small
oil-lamp and a candle, "that looks a nice bed--but I am not fated to
sleep in it."

"So I understand from the young woman, my lord."

"Once only, my lord, and on that occasion an accident was only narrowly
averted. Owing to my unfortunate lack of manual dexterity I was very
nearly hanged in the rope, my lord."

==> "That's enough about hanging," said Wimsey, peevishly. "We're not <==
detecting now, and I don't want to talk shop."

"Certainly not, my lord. Does your lordship desire to be shaved?"

"Yes--let's start the New Year with a clean face."

==> Descending, clean and shaven, to the dining-room, Wimsey found the table <==
moved aside and eight chairs set in a circle. On seven of the chairs sat
seven men, varying in age from a gnarled old gnome with a long beard to
an embarrassed youth with his hair plastered into a cow-lick; in the
centre, the Rector stood twittering like an amiable magician.

"Ah! there you are! Splendid! excellent! Now, lads, this is Lord Peter
==> Wimsey, who has been providentially sent to assist us out of our <==
difficulty. He tells me he is a little out of practice, so I am sure you
will not mind putting in a little time to enable him to get his hand in
again. Now I must introduce you all. Lord Peter, this is Hezekiah
Lavender, who has pulled the Tenor for sixty years and means to pull it
for twenty years longer, don't you, Hezekiah?"

"Ezra Wilderspin," went on the Rector. "He's our biggest man, and he
pulls the smallest bell. That's often the way of things, isn't it? He is
our blacksmith, by the way, and has promised to get your car put right
for you in the morning."

==> The blacksmith laughed sheepishly, engulfed Wimsey's fingers in an <==
enormous hand and retired to his chair in some confusion.

"Jack Godfrey," continued the Rector. "Number Seven. How's Batty Thomas
going now, Jack?"

ready, we'll ring a little touch of 96, just to put this gentleman in
the way of it, like. You'll remember, my lord, that you starts by making
the first snapping lead with the treble and after that you goes into the
slow hunt till she comes down to snap with you again."

==> "Right you are," said Wimsey. "And after that I make the thirds and <==
fourths."

"That's so, my lord. And then it's three steps forward and one step back
till you lay the blows behind."

Mr. Hezekiah Lavender having called three successive bobs, the bells
came back into rounds without mishap.

"Excellent," said the Rector. "You made no mistake about that."

==> "All right, so far," said Wimsey. <==

"The gentleman will do well enough," agreed Mr. Lavender. "Now, boys,
once again. What 'ull we make it this time, sir?"

"Make it a 704," said the Rector, consulting his watch. "Call her in the

ringing went successfully through to its conclusion.

"Well rung all," cried the Rector. "Our new recruit will do us credit, I
think, Hezekiah?"

==> "I almost fell down in the second lead, though," said Wimsey, laughing. <==
"I as nearly as possible forgot to lay the four blows in fourths place
at the bob. However, nearly isn't quite."

"You'll keep your place all right, my lord," said Mr. Lavender. "As for
you, Wally Pratt----"

in apple-pie order for us."

Mr. Godfrey smiled.

"We'll need to let the tuckings down a goodish bit for his lordship," he
==> observed, measuring Wimsey with his eye; "he's none so tall as Will <==
Thoday, not by a long chalk."

"Never you mind," said Wimsey. "In the words of the old bell-motto: I'd
have it to be understood that though I'm little, yet I'm good."

He conducted his guest westwards under the tower arch, and thence, in
the wake of Jack Godfrey's lantern, up a steep and winding belfry stair,
its stone treads worn shallow with the feet of countless long-dead
ringers. After a turn or so, the procession halted; there was a jingling
of keys and the lantern moved away to the right through a narrow door.
==> Wimsey, following, found himself in the ringing chamber of the belfry. <==

It was in no way remarkable, except in being perhaps a little loftier
than the average, on account of the exceptional height of the tower. By
daylight, it was well lit, having a fine window of three lights on each
of its three exterior sides, while low down in the eastern wall, a

daylight, it was well lit, having a fine window of three lights on each
of its three exterior sides, while low down in the eastern wall, a
couple of unglazed openings, defended by iron bars against accident,
gave upon the interior of the church, a little above the level of the
clerestory windows. As Jack Godfrey set the lantern on the floor, and
==> proceeded to light a paraffin lamp which hung against the wall, Wimsey <==
could see the eight bell-ropes, their woollen sallies looped neatly to
the walls, and their upper ends vanishing mysteriously into the shadows
of the chamber roof. Then the light streamed out and the walls took
shape and colour. They were plainly plastered, with a painted motto in
Gothic lettering running round below the windows: "They Have Neither

is Gone Forth into All Lands." Above this, various tablets of wood,
brass and even stone, commemorated the ringing of remarkable peals in
the past.

"We shall hope to put up a new tablet after to-night," said the Rector's
==> voice in Wimsey's ear. <==

"I only hope I may do nothing to prevent it," said Wimsey. "I see you
have the old regulations for your ringers. Ah! 'Keep stroak of time and
goe not out, Or elles you forfeit out of doubt For every fault a Jugg of
beer.' It doesn't say how big a jug, but there is something about the

and let down to its full length the portion of rope below the sallie.

"When you've got her raised," he said, "we'll fix them tuckings proper.
Unless you'd like me to raise her for you?"

==> "Not on your life," said Wimsey. "It's a poor ringer that can't raise <==
his own bell." He grasped the rope and pulled it gently downwards,
gathering the slack in his left hand. Softly, tremulously, high overhead
in the tower, Sabaoth began to speak, and her sisters after her as the
ringers stood to their ropes. "Tin-tin-tin," cried Gaude in her silvery
treble; "tan-tan," answered Sabaoth; "din-din-din," "dan-dan-dan," said

John and Jericho, climbing to their places; "bim, bam, bim, bam,"
Jubilee and Dimity followed; "bom," said Batty Thomas; and Tailor Paul,
majestically lifting up her great bronze mouth, bellowed "bo, bo, bo,"
as the ropes hauled upon the wheels.

==> Wimsey brought his bell competently up and set her at backstroke while <==
the tuckings were finally adjusted, after which, at the Rector's
suggestion, a few rounds were rung to let him "get the feel of her."

"You can leave your bells up, boys," said Mr. Hezekiah Lavender,
graciously, when this last rehearsal was concluded, "but don't you go

and the Rector, sighing a little, accepted defeat.

"I fear it is true," he said, as he trotted down the path, "that I am
inclined to lose count of time."

==> "Perhaps," replied Wimsey politely, "the being continually in and about <==
this church brings eternity too close."

"Very true," said the Rector, "very true--though there are mementoes
enough to mark the passage of time. Remind me to-morrow to show you the
tomb of Nathaniel Perkins--one of our local worthies and a great

"You must get some rest yourself, Theodore."

"Yes, yes, my dear. In a moment. I was only----"

==> Wimsey saw that the one way to quiet the Rector was to desert him <==
without compunction. He retired, accordingly, and was captured at the
head of the stairs by Bunter, who tucked him firmly up beneath the
eiderdown with a hot-water bottle and shut the door upon him.

A roaring fire burned in the grate. Wimsey drew the lamp closer to him,

the title-page:

himself with a jerk and read: "... if the 5th is in course after the 7th
(says Shipway), and 7th after the 6th, they are right, when the small
bells, 2, 3, 4, are brought as directed in the preceding peals; but if
6, 7 are together without the 5th, call the 5th into the hunt...."

                 *        *        *        *        *

He was roused by the pealing of bells.

"Nearly five minutes to eleven, my lord."

As he spoke, the pealing ceased, and Jubilee began to ring the
five-minute bell.

==> "Dash it all!" said Wimsey. "This will never do. Must go and hear the <==
old boy's sermon. Give me a hair-brush. Is it still snowing?"

"Harder than ever, my lord."

Wimsey made a hasty toilet and ran downstairs, Bunter following him

Rectory. Old Hezekiah Lavender greeted Wimsey with a welcoming chuckle
and thrust a prayer-book under his nose as he knelt down to pray.

"Dearly beloved brethren----"

==> Wimsey scrambled to his feet and looked round. <==

At the first glance he felt himself sobered and awe-stricken by the
noble proportions of the church, in whose vast spaces the
congregation--though a good one for so small a parish in the dead of a
winter's night--seemed almost lost. The wide nave and shadowy aisles,

[line number in individual story] matching line = 1053    window = 1048 1058

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 93030    window = 93025 93035


entranced with wonder and delight. Incredibly aloof, flinging back the
light in a dusky shimmer of bright hair and gilded outspread wings,
soared the ranked angels, cherubim and seraphim, choir over choir, from
corbel and hammer-beam floating face to face uplifted.

==> "My God!" muttered Wimsey, not without reverence. And he softly repeated <==
to himself: "He rode upon the cherubims and did fly; He came flying upon
the wings of the wind."

Mr. Hezekiah Lavender poked his new colleague sharply in the ribs, and
Wimsey became aware that the congregation had settled down to the

Mr. Hezekiah Lavender poked his new colleague sharply in the ribs, and
==> Wimsey became aware that the congregation had settled down to the <==
General Confession, leaving him alone and agape upon his feet. Hurriedly
he turned the leaves of his prayer-book and applied himself to making
the proper responses. Mr. Lavender, who had obviously decided that he
was either a half-wit or a heathen, assisted him by finding the Psalms
for him and by bawling every verse very loudly in his ear.

chance" to assist in this work of devotion. Lord Peter blushed, the
Rector pronounced the Benediction, the organ played the opening bars of
a hymn and Hezekiah Lavender exclaimed sonorously: "Now, lads!" The
ringers, with much subdued shuffling, extricated themselves from their
chairs and wound their way up the belfry stair. Coats were pulled off
==> and hung on nails in the ringing-chamber, and Wimsey, observing on a <==
bench near the door an enormous brown jug and nine pewter tankards,
understood, with pleasure, that the landlord of the Red Cow had, indeed,
provided "the usual" for the refreshment of the ringers.

The eight men advanced to their stations, and Hezekiah consulted his

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 93111    window = 93106 93116


like a giant in the midst of them. Up and down went the shadows of the
ringers upon the walls, up and down went the scarlet sallies flickering
roofwards and floorwards, and up and down, hunting in their courses,
went the bells of Fenchurch St. Paul.

==> Wimsey, his eye upon the ropes and his ear pricked for the treble's <==
shrill tongue speaking at lead, had little attention to give to anything
but his task. He was dimly conscious of old Hezekiah, moving with the
smooth rhythm of a machine, bowing his ancient back very slightly at
each pull to bring Tailor Paul's great weight over, and of Wally Pratt,
his face anxiously contorted and his lips moving in the effort to keep

bells. At the end of the first hour the Rector took the rope from the
hand of the agitated Wally and released him for an interval of rest and
refreshment. A soft glugging sound proclaimed that Mr. Donnington's
"usual" was going where it would do most good.

==> Wimsey, relieved at the end of the third hour, found Mrs. Venables <==
seated among the pewter pots, with Bunter in respectful attendance
beside her.

"I do hope," said Mrs. Venables, "that you are not feeling exhausted."

seated among the pewter pots, with Bunter in respectful attendance
beside her.

"I do hope," said Mrs. Venables, "that you are not feeling exhausted."

==> "Far from it; only rather dry." Wimsey remedied this condition without <==
further apology, and asked how the peal sounded.

"Beautiful!" said Mrs. Venables, loyally. She did not really care for
bell-music, and felt sleepy; but the Rector would have felt hurt if she
had withdrawn her sympathetic presence.

[line number in individual story] matching line = 1177    window = 1172 1182

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 93154    window = 93149 93159


bell-music, and felt sleepy; but the Rector would have felt hurt if she
had withdrawn her sympathetic presence.

"It's surprising, isn't it?" she added, "how soft and mellow it sounds
in here. But of course there's another floor between us and the
==> bell-chamber." She yawned desperately. The bells rang on. Wimsey, <==
knowing that the Rector was well set for the next quarter of an hour,
was seized with a fancy to listen to the peal from outside. He slipped
down the winding stair and groped his way through the south porch. As he
emerged into the night, the clamour of the bells smote on his ears like
a blow. The snow was falling less heavily now. He turned to his right,

[line number in individual story] matching line = 1195    window = 1190 1200

between the last two buttresses on the north side he came upon a path
leading to a small door; this he tried, but found it locked, and so
passed on, encountering the full violence of the wind as he rounded the
east end. Pausing a moment to get his breath, he looked out over the
Fen. All was darkness, except for a dim stationary light which might
==> have been shining from some cottage window. Wimsey reckoned that the <==
cottage must lie somewhere along the solitary road by which they had
reached the Rectory, and wondered why anybody should be awake at three
o'clock on New Year's morning. But the night was bitter and he was
wanted back at his job. He completed his circuit, re-entered by the
south porch and returned to the belfry. The Rector resigned the rope to

[line number in individual story] matching line = 1253    window = 1248 1258

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 93230    window = 93225 93235



"There, there!" said the Rector. "Never mind, Wally, you did very well
indeed. Where's Lord Peter--oh! there you are. I'm sure we owe you a
great deal. Not too fatigued, I hope?"

==> "No, no," said Wimsey, extricating himself from the congratulatory <==
handshakes of his companions. He felt, in fact, exhausted to
dropping-point. He had not rung a long peal for years, and the effort of
keeping alert for so many hours had produced an almost intolerable
desire to tumble down in a corner and go to sleep. "I--ah--oh--I'm
perfectly all right."

[line number in individual story] matching line = 1321    window = 1316 1326

wooden case, assured her that he was well protected. He was bundled into
the waiting car by Johnson, and whirled away westwards towards the
village.

This untoward incident cast a certain gloom over the breakfast table,
==> though Wimsey, who felt his sides clapping together like an empty <==
portmanteau, was only too thankful to devour his eggs and bacon and
coffee in peace. Eight pairs of jaws chumped steadily, while Mrs.
Venables dispensed the provisions in a somewhat distracted way,
interspersing her hospitable urgings with ejaculations of sympathy for
the Thorpe family and anxiety for her husband's well-being.

Donnington? Hinkins, pass Mr. Godfrey the cold ham. And of course, Sir
Henry never has been strong since the War, poor man. Are you getting
enough to eat down there, Wally? I do hope the Rector won't be kept too
long without his breakfast. Lord Peter, a little more coffee?"

==> Wimsey thanked her, and asked what, exactly, was the trouble about old <==
Sir Charles and the necklace.

"Oh, of course, you don't know. So silly of me! Living in this solitary
place, one imagines that one's little local excitements are of
world-wide importance. It's rather a long story, and I shouldn't have

be gettin' to work on old Tailor Paul again."

He shuffled sturdily out, and within five minutes they heard the deep
and melancholy voice of the bell ringing, first the six tailors for a
woman and then the quick strokes which announce the age of the dead.
==> Wimsey counted them up to thirty-seven. Then they ceased, and were <==
followed by the slow tolling of single strokes at half-minute intervals.
In the dining-room, the silence was only broken by the shy sound of
hearty feeders trying to finish their meal inconspicuously.

The party broke up quietly. Mr. Wilderspin drew Wimsey to one side and

explained that he had sent round to Mr. Ashton for a couple of
farm-horses and a stout rope, and hoped to get the car out of the ditch
in a very short time, and would then see what was needed in the way of
repairs. If his lordship cared to step along to the smithy in an hour or
so, they could go into consultation about the matter. His (Mr.

so, they could go into consultation about the matter. His (Mr.
Wilderspin's) son George was a great hand with motors, having had
considerable experience with farm engines, not to mention his own
motor-bike. Mrs. Venables retired into the study to see that her husband
had everything he wanted and to administer such consolation as she might
==> for the calamity that had befallen the parish. Wimsey, knowing that his <==
presence at Frog's Bridge could not help and would probably only hinder
the break-down team, begged his hostess not to trouble about him, and

Joe Hinkins, polishing the Rector's aged car. Joe accepted a cigarette,

and she had a wonderful fine emerald necklace--worth thousands and
thousands of pounds it was--and the very night after the wedding, when
Mr. Henry and his lady was just gone off for their honeymoon, the
necklace was stole."

==> "Good lord!" said Wimsey. He sat down on the running-board of the car <==
and looked as encouraging as he could.

"You may say so," said Mr. Hinkins, much gratified. "A big sensation it
made at the time in the parish. And the worst part of it was, you see,
that one of Sir Charles' own men was concerned in it. Poor gentleman, he

"That's right, my lord. That's what I was a-telling you. You see, it

"Ah!" said Mrs. Venables, suddenly popping her head in at the garage
door. "So you've got Joe on to the Thorpe robbery. He knows a lot more
about it than I do. Are you sure you aren't frozen to death in this
place?"

==> Wimsey said he was quite warm enough, thanks, and he hoped the Rector <==
was none the worse for his exertions.

"He doesn't seem to be," said Mrs. Venables, "but he's rather upset,
naturally. You'll stay to lunch, of course. No trouble at all. Can you
eat shepherd's pie? You're sure? The butcher doesn't call to-day, but

She bustled away. Joe Hinkins passed a chamois leather thoughtfully over

"Well, my lord, the police did come and of course they hunted round a

Drove, but if necessary the postmistress could be asked to telephone and
find out. She would be the right party to do it, since, leaving out the
post-office, there was no other telephone in the village, except at the
Red House, which wouldn't be convenient at a time like the present.

==> Wimsey, looking dubiously at his front axle, thought it might perhaps be <==
advisable to procure the skilled assistance of Mr. Brownlow and said he
would approach the postmistress for that purpose, if Mr. Wilderspin
would give him a lift into the village. He scrambled up, therefore,
behind Mr. Ashton's greys, and the procession took its way past the
church for the better part of a quarter of a mile, till it reached the

green dyke of Potter's Lode spans it like a string to a bow. Outside the
group of the Fenchurches, the land rises slightly all round, being
drained by cross-dyking into the Wale.

==> Lord Peter Wimsey, having seen the front axle of the Daimler taken down <==
and decided that Mr. Brownlow and Mr. Wilderspin could probably fix it
up between them, dispatched his message from the post-office, sent a
wire to the friends who were expecting him at Walbeach, and then cast
about him for some occupation. The village presented nothing of
interest, so he determined to go and have a look at the church. The

monks' stalls, with misereres. Isn't the carving fine? There's a piscina
in the sanctuary, but not a very exciting one."

piscinas.

"And the altar-rails are very poor, of course--Victorian horrors. We
want very much to put up something better in their place when we can
find the money. I'm sorry I haven't the key to the tower. You'd like to

the other day, and not so long ago someone broke open the alms-box. That
wouldn't have mattered so much, because there was very little in it, but
they did a lot of wanton damage in the sanctuary--out of disappointment,
I suppose, and one can't really allow that, can one?"

==> Wimsey said, No, one couldn't, and Yes, he would like to look round the <==
church a little longer and would remember about the key. He spent the
first few minutes after the good lady had left him in putting a suitable
donation into the alms-box and in examining the font, whose carvings
were certainly curious and, to his mind, suggestive of a symbolism
neither altogether Christian nor altogether innocent. He noted a heavy

Along the bleak white road a solitary figure, plodding towards them, had

"No; I do not think that the blows were the cause of death."

"Why do you say that, Dr. Baines?"

Dr. Baines added a number of technical reasons for his opinion, chiefly
connected with the absence of any extra-vasation of blood and the
general appearance of the skin; adding, with proper modesty, that he
was, of course, not an expert and could only proffer his opinion for

There was general greeting. The Rector caught the arm of a tall, thin
man hurrying past their little group.

Hands were shaken.

acquainted with one another.

"Pleased to meet you, my lord. I've heard of you through my old friend

surprised if we was to hear of those emeralds again before very long."

confidential, of course?"

"Perfectly. I'm a terrific success at pottering round asking sloppy

hand on Woollcott's _History of the Bells of Fenchurch St. Paul_, which
he had once spoken about. The Rector thought he could, and after he had
hunted through all his study shelves and enlisted the aid of Mrs.
Venables and Emily, the book was in fact discovered in a small room
devoted to the activities of the Clothing Club ("and how it could have

suggestive of anything in the way of corpses or emeralds:

very much result. The dates, the weights and the mottoes--was there
anything here that could serve as a guide to buried treasure? Batty
Thomas and Tailor Paul had been particularly mentioned, but try as he
would, for him they had neither speech nor language. After a time he
gave up his calculations. Possibly there was something about the bells

offering him with one hand his hat and with the other two leather-bound
volumes on a small salver.

allusion to the unfortunate stranger whose funeral was to take place on

dear when we're dead, even if beforehand somebody hated us enough to tie
us up and ... Great Scott, yes! What about that rope?"

The problem of the rope--absurdly overlooked and now absurdly

Lord's Prayer; nor had he even wits to spare for a sardonic commentary
on the means used by Providence to deliver this our brother out of the
miseries of this sinful world. He was amazed that he had not earlier
seized upon the rope as a clue to the labyrinth. For the tying-up of the
dead man implied so much.

Where had the rope come from? How had it happened to be handy for the
tying-up, and where had that tying taken place? You might kill a man in
hot blood, but you did not first tie him. The death of a bound man meant
premeditation--a calf roped for the shambles. The rope had been removed
before burial; there was a horrid thrift about that.... At this point
==> Wimsey shook himself. There was no need to fancy things; there were <==
plenty of other reasons for the removal of the rope. It had been removed
before death. It had been removed and replaced where it came from, lest
its absence should arouse suspicion. It had been removed for the same
reason that the face had been mutilated--lest anyone finding the body
should recognise it. Finally, it had been removed because it had tied

supposing your father hadn't died when he did, what sort of tombstone
would he have been likely to put up to your mother? Any idea?"

"Why, because old Gotobed would be certain to notice if anybody had been

apprehensive reverence which one feels for a quaint and brittle piece of
antiquity.

suffers sadly from rheumatoid arthritis--but she is looking forward to
seeing Hilary at home."

and bestowed on Hilary Thorpe a grin of understanding sympathy. "Why?
Corrupting the morals of youth? Or showing too much zeal about digging
up the family mystery? Is Uncle Edward a dark horse or a plain ass, I
wonder? Did he go to his brother's wedding? I must ask Blundell. Where
is Blundell? I wonder if he is free to-night?"

The Superintendent brought out an official photograph from a bureau
which stood, stacked neatly with documents, in a corner of the room.

"When was this taken?"

"About four years ago, my lord, when he went up for his last sentence.
That's the latest we have."

decided that he had just about time to go along to Will Thoday's. He was
pretty sure to find Mary at home, and, with luck, might catch Will
himself when he came home to dinner. His way led him past the
churchyard. He drove slowly, and, glancing over the churchyard wall as

apparently meditating among the tombs.

"'Morning!" cried the Superintendent cheerfully, "'Morning, my lord!"

Mr. Blundell stopped his car at the lych-gate, clambered out, grunting
(for he was growing rather stout) and made his way up the path.

==> Wimsey was sitting on a large, flat tombstone, and in his hands was <==
about the last thing the Superintendent might have expected to see,
namely, a large reel of line, to which, in the curious, clumsy-looking
but neat and methodical manner of the fisherman, his lordship was
affixing a strong cast adorned with three salmon-hooks.

affixing a strong cast adorned with three salmon-hooks.

"Hullo!" said Mr. Blundell. "Bit of an optimist, aren't you? Nothing but
coarse fishing about here."

==> "Very coarse," said Wimsey. "Hush! While you were interviewing Mrs. <==
Gates, where do you think I was? In the garage, inciting our friend
Johnson to theft. From Sir Henry's study. Hist! not a word!"

"A good many years since he went fishing, poor soul," said Mr. Blundell,
sympathetically.

"A good many years since he went fishing, poor soul," said Mr. Blundell,

making a complicated knot and pulling it tight with his teeth. "Are you
busy, or have you got time to look at something?"

"I was going along to Thoday's, but there's no great hurry. And, by the

"Sounds all right," he said. He searched in his pocket, and produced a
handful of lead sinkers, some of which he proceeded to affix to his
cast.

Mr. Blundell, suspecting some kind of mystification, watched him in
discreet silence.

Rector. He had mislaid them, of course, but they turned up eventually
among the Clothing Club accounts."

He led the way to the cope-chest beneath the tower, and threw it open.

The Superintendent scratched his head and gazed vaguely about the

"I'm on; we can but try."

The air came up cold and dank from the surface of the water. Far below a
circle of light reflected the pale sky and the beam of the torch showed
hooks and line working steadily downwards. Then a tiny break in the
reflection marked the moment when the hooks touched the water.

"More water than I thought. Where are those leads? Now then, we'll try

"Yes. Better not touch the knots, my lord. They might tell us something

Mr. Ashton was a farmer of the old school. He might have been fifty

gruff barks, and held himself so rigidly that if he had swallowed a

gnarled and chalky joints, concluded, however, that his unbending aspect
was due less to austerity than to chronic arthritis. His wife was
considerably younger than himself; plump where he was spare,
bounce-about where he was stately, merry where he was grave, and
talkative where he was monosyllabic. They made his lordship extremely

"That's true enough," admitted Mrs. Ashton, amiably. "I do let my tongue

led the conversation to the matter of lights in the churchyard.

"There, now!" exclaimed Mrs. Ashton. "I always thought as there might be
something in that tale as little Rosie Thoday told our Polly. But
children do have so many fancies, you never know."

==> "Why, what tale was that?" asked Wimsey. <==

"Ugh! foolish nonsense, foolish nonsense," said Mr. Ashton. "Ghosts and
what not."

"Oh, _that's_ foolish enough, I dare say," retorted his lady, "but you

out that Rosie's seen what she took to be the spirit of Lady Thorpe
a-flittin' about her grave. And it seems the night she see her was the
night of the funeral."

==> "Dear me," said Wimsey. "What exactly did she see?" <==

"No more than a light, by what Polly could make out. That was one of the
nights Will Thoday was very bad, and it seems Rosie was up and about
helping her mother--for she's a good, handy child, is Rosie--and she
looks out o' the window and sees the light just a-rising out of where

Superintendent Blundell was not best pleased when this conversation was
repeated to him.

"Thoday and his wife had better be careful," he observed.

==> "They told you the exact truth, you know," said Wimsey. <==

"Ah!" said Mr. Blundell. "I don't like witnesses to be so damned
particular about exact truth. They get away with it as often as not, and
then where are you? Not but what I did think of speaking to Rosie, but
her mother called her away double quick--and no wonder! Besides, I don't

==> Lord Peter Wimsey sat in the schoolroom at the Rectory, brooding over a <==
set of underclothing. The schoolroom was, in fact, no longer the
schoolroom, and had not been so for nearly twenty years. It had retained
its name from the time when the Rector's daughters departed to a real
boarding-school. It was now devoted to Parish Business, but a fragrance
of long-vanished governesses still clung about it--governesses with

like the shadow of corruption, and here and there the fabric had rotted
away, as the garments of mortality will, when the grave has had its way
with them. Wafted in through the open window came the funeral scent of
jonquils.

==> Wimsey whistled gently as he examined the underclothes, which had been <==
mended with scrupulous and economical care. It puzzled him that Cranton,
last seen in London in September, should possess a French vest and pants
so much worn and so carefully repaired. His shirt and outer
garments--now also clean and folded--lay on a chair close at hand. They,
too, were well-worn, but they were English. Why should Cranton be

so much worn and so carefully repaired. His shirt and outer
garments--now also clean and folded--lay on a chair close at hand. They,
too, were well-worn, but they were English. Why should Cranton be
wearing second-hand French underclothes?

==> Wimsey knew that it would be hopeless to try tracing the garments <==
through the makers. Underwear of this mark and quality was sold by the
hundred thousand in Paris and throughout the provinces. It lay stacked
up outside the great linen-drapers' shops, marked "Occasions," and
thrifty housewives bought it there for cash. There was no laundry-mark;
the washing had doubtless been done at home by the housewife herself or

Lord Peter thrust his fingers into his hair till the sleek yellow locks
stood upright. "Bless his heart!" thought Mrs. Venables, looking in upon
him through the window. She had conceived a warm maternal affection for
her guest. "Would you like a glass of milk, or a whisky-and-soda, or a
==> cup of beef-tea?" she suggested, hospitably. Wimsey laughed and thanked <==
her, but declined.

"I hope you won't catch anything from those dreadful old clothes," said
Mrs. Venables. "I'm sure they can't be healthy."

make out about these underthings. Perhaps you can suggest something."
Mrs. Venables came in, and he laid his problem before her.

"Yes; but the man I met wasn't a Frenchman."

"But you don't know he was the man you met. He may be somebody quite
different."

==> "Well, he _may_," said Wimsey, dubiously. <==

"He didn't bring any other clothes with him, I suppose?"

"No; not a thing. He was just a tramping out-of-work. Or he said he was.
All he brought was an old British trench-coat, which he took with him,

building and they _are_ so messy. I should wear a hat if I were you. Or
there's always an old umbrella in the summer-house. Did he leave his hat
behind too?"

==> "In a sense he did," said Wimsey. "We've found that, in rather a queer <==
place. But it doesn't help us much."

"Oh!" said Mrs. Venables, "how tiresome it all is. I'm sure you'll wear
your brains right out with all these problems. You mustn't overdo
yourself. And the butcher says he has some nice calf's liver to-day,

kitchen and extraordinarily good at music-hall imitations. Twice as good

==> "Is he indeed?" said Wimsey. "I had no idea of it. But what I don't know <==
about Bunter would fill a book."

Mrs. Venables bustled away, but her remarks remained in Wimsey's mind.
He put aside the vest and pants, filled a pipe and wandered down the
garden, pursued by Mrs. Venables with an ancient and rook-proof linen

He put aside the vest and pants, filled a pipe and wandered down the
garden, pursued by Mrs. Venables with an ancient and rook-proof linen

him, and the fact that he immediately put it on, with expressions of
gratitude, may attest the kind heart which, despite the poet, is

business in rural post-offices, while pigs lurched against his bumpers
and bullocks blew down his neck. Presently, Bunter returned, having
drawn a blank despite a careful search conducted by three young ladies
and the postmaster in person.

==> "Well, never mind," said Wimsey. "Leamholt is the post town, so I <==
thought we ought to give it the first chance. The other possibilities
are Holport and Walbeach, on this side of the Drain. Holport is a long
way off and rather unlikely. I think we will try Walbeach. There's a
direct road from here--at least, as direct as any fen road ever is.... I

pleasant hush that falls on country towns where all days but market days
are endless sabbaths. Bunter was absent for some time, and, when he
emerged, did so with a trifle less than his usual sedateness, while his
usually colourless face was very slightly flushed about the cheek-bones.

==> "What luck?" inquired Wimsey, genially. <==

To his surprise, Bunter replied by a hasty gesture enjoining silence and
caution. Wimsey waited till he had taken his place in the car and
altered his question to:

altered his question to:

"What's up?"

"Better move on quickly, my lord," said Bunter, "because, while the

according to our previous arrangement, that I had intended to visit
Walbeach a few weeks ago, but had been prevented from doing so, and that
I understand that an important letter had been forwarded to me at this
address under a misapprehension."

==> "Very good," said Wimsey. "All according to Cocker." <==

"The young person, my lord, then opened a species of safe or locker, and
searched in it, and after the expiration of a considerable period,
turned round with a letter in her hand and inquired what name I had
said."

"I hope I may say that I always am, my lord. On seeing the blue stamp, I
added quickly (calling to mind the circumstances of the case) that the
letter had been posted in France."

==> "Very good, indeed," said Wimsey, nodding approval. <==

"The young person, my lord, appeared to be puzzled by this remark. She
said, in a doubtful tone, that there was a letter from France which had
been lying in the post-office for three weeks, but that it was addressed
to another person."

"Yes, my lord; that thought passed through my own mind. I said, 'Are you
quite sure, miss, that you have not mistaken the handwriting?' I am
happy to say, my lord, that the young person--being young, and, no

==> "Paul Taylor!" cried Wimsey, in sudden excitement, "Why, that was the <==
name----"

"Precisely, my lord. As I was about to say, at that point it was
necessary to act promptly. I said at once: 'Paul Taylor? Why, that is

"Excellent. Well, it's all very illegal, either way, but we'll get
Blundell to put it right for us--I'd have suggested his doing it
himself, but it was such a shot at a venture that I didn't think he'd
cotton to it, and I hadn't a devil of a lot of faith in it myself. And

lips--"anyway, it was _my_ jolly old idea and I wanted us to have the

perfectly brilliant in two places and I'm as bucked as hell. What's

not to be despised, to celebrate our deed of darkness and derring-do."

themselves established in a dark old upper room, facing away from the
square and looking out upon the squat, square church tower, with the
rooks wheeling over it and the seagulls swooping and dipping among the
gravestones. Wimsey ordered roast lamb and a bottle of the
far-from-despicable claret and was soon in conversation with the waiter,

Not till the port (Tuke Holdsworth '08) was set upon the table did

He twisted the car across the bridge and brought it to a standstill
close beside the sluice-keeper's cottage. The man came out to see what
was wanted and was lured, without difficulty, into a desultory

standing on the narrow wooden foot-bridge that ran across the sluice,
gazing down thoughtfully into the green water. The tide was on the ebb

the Wale water discharged itself sluggishly towards the sea.

"Ah!" said the sluice-keeper. "I believe you." He spat into the river.
"This here sluice has been needing repairs--oh! a matter of twenty year,
now. And more."

"Then why don't they do it?"

"Ah!" said the sluice-keeper.

not interrupt him. Then he spoke, weightily, and with long years of
endurance in his voice.

"Nobody knows whose job this here sluice is, seemin'ly. The Fen Drainage
Board, now--they say as it did oughter be done by the Wale Conservancy

Board. And _they_ say the Fen Drainage Board did oughter see to it. And
now they've agreed to refer it, like, to the East Level Waterways
Commission. But they ain't made their report yet." He spat again and was
silent.

==> "But," said Wimsey, "suppose you got a lot of water up this way, would <==
the gates stand it?"

"Well, they might and they mightn't," replied the sluice-keeper. "But we
don't get much water up here these days. I have heard tell as it was
different in Oliver Cromwell's time, but we don't get a great lot now."

"No, that's the Wale Conservancy, that is."

"But it must have occurred to them that it might make a difference to

feebleness of mind.

"Ain't I telling yew? They don't rightly know if it did oughter be paid
for by the Fen Drainage or the Wale Conservancy. Why," and a note of

of money, so they say."

unemployment about, too. Do you get many of the unemployed tramping
round this way?"

"Times we do, times we don't."

where it is, you see."

Conservancy Board and the Commission between them ought to be able to
absorb some of these men and give you a fresh set of gates. However,
it's not my business, and I'll have to be pushing along."

it to Geneva? Ha, ha!"

"That's right," said the sluice-keeper, anxious that the point of the
jest should not be lost. "Why don't they refer it to Geneva? See?"

"That's right," said the sluice-keeper, anxious that the point of the
jest should not be lost. "Why don't they refer it to Geneva? See?"

==> "Splendid!" said Wimsey. "I won't forget that. Ha, ha, ha!" <==

He gently released the clutch. As they moved away, he glanced back and
saw the sluice-keeper convulsed by the remembrance of his own wit.

Lord Peter's misgivings about the letter were duly confirmed. He
honourably submitted it, unopened, to Superintendent Blundell, as soon
as the latter returned from attendance at the Quarter Sessions where he
==> had been engaged all day. The Superintendent was alarmed by Wimsey's <==
unorthodox raid on the post-office, but pleased by his subsequent
discretion, and readily allowed him full credit for zeal and
intelligence. Together they opened the envelope. The letter, which bore
no address, was written on thin paper of the same poor quality as the
envelope, and began:

a wife in France between this and last September--I mean, between this

dash it all, my lord, let's read the blooming letter. You might read it
out in English, would you? My French is a bit off, these days."

==>     "My dear husband" (Wimsey translated),--You told me not to write <==
    to you, without great urgency, but three months are past and I
    have no news of you. I am very anxious, asking myself if you
    have      not been taken by the military authorities. You have
    assured me      that they could not now have you shot, the War
    being over so long      ago, but it is known that the English

Superintendent Blundell listened aghast; then snatched the paper from

some better meaning from the words by mere force of staring at them.

"Little Pierre--nine years old--kisses to their papa--and the red cow's
dead--t'cha!" He did a little arithmetic on his fingers. "Nine years
ago, Cranton was in gaol."

==> "Step-father, perhaps?" suggested Wimsey. <==

Mr. Blundell paid no heed. "Spring sowing--since when has Cranton turned
farmer? And what's all that about military authorities? And the War.
Cranton never was in the War. There's something here I can't make head

was Cranton I met on New Year's Day."

"I'd better get on the telephone to London," said Mr. Blundell. "And
then I'll have to be seeing the Chief Constable about this. Whatever it
is, it's got to be followed up. Driver's disappeared and we've found a

and stared vaguely over the Superintendent's head at the rooks wheeling
high over the elms at the end of the garden. "You've done your best,
Blundell, but I think we had better hand the thing over, lock, stock and
barrel to Scotland Yard. Perhaps we ought to have done so earlier."

==> Mr. Blundell looked chagrined. Lord Peter Wimsey, who had come with him, <==
ostensibly in case help should be needed to translate the commissaire's
letter, but actually because he was determined not to be left out of
anything, coughed gently.

"If you would entrust the inquiry to me, sir," he murmured, "I could pop

isn't interrogation part of a special constable's duties?"

"It is not," said the Chief Constable. "Still," he went on, "still--I
suppose I might stretch a point. And I suppose"--he looked hard at

"Nothing to prevent me from making a private tour of the battle-fields,"
said Wimsey, "and, of course, if I met one of my old Scotland Yard pals
knocking round there, I might join up with him. But I really think that,
in these hard times, we ought to consider the public purse, don't you,

"It is not," said the Chief Constable. "Still," he went on, "still--I

Wimsey--"I suppose you'll go in any case."

"Nothing to prevent me from making a private tour of the battle-fields,"

The Chief Constable was thoughtful. He had no real wish to call in

in these hard times, we ought to consider the public purse, don't you,
sir?"

The Chief Constable was thoughtful. He had no real wish to call in
Scotland Yard. He had an idea that a Yard man might make himself an
==> officious nuisance. He gave way. Within two days, Wimsey was being <==
cordially received by M. le commissaire Rozier. A gentleman who has
"_des relations intimes_" with the Paris Sûreté, and who speaks perfect
French, is likely to be well received by country _commissaires de
police_. M. Rozier produced a bottle of very excellent wine, entreated
his visitor to make himself at home, and embarked upon his story.

there a formidable mystery. For ten years I have said to myself,
'Aristide Rozier, the day will come when your premonitions concerning
the so-called Jean Legros will be justified.' I perceive that the day is
at hand, and I congratulate myself upon my foresight."

==> "Evidently," said Wimsey, "M. le commissaire possesses a penetrating <==
intelligence."

"To lay the matter clearly before you, I am obliged to go back to the
summer of 1918. Milord served in the British Army? Ah! then milord will
remember the retreat over the Marne in July. _Quelle histoire

interrogated. His replies were simply that his mind was a blank. He
remembered nothing of his past--but nothing. He did not know his name,
or his place of origin; he had no recollection of the War. For him, his
life began in the farm-house at C----y."

==> M. Rozier paused impressively, while Wimsey registered amazement. <==

"Well, milord, you will understand that it was necessary to report the
case at once to the Army authorities. He was seen by a number of
officers, none of whom could recognise him, and his portrait and
measurements were circulated without result. It was thought at first

milord--to set traps for him. They suddenly shouted words of command at
him in English, French and German, thinking that he might display an
automatic reaction. But it was to no purpose. He seemed to have
forgotten the War."

==> "Lucky devil!" said Wimsey, with feeling. <==

"_Je suis de votre avis._ Nevertheless, a reaction of some kind would
have been satisfying. Time passed, and he became no better. They sent
him back to us. Now you know, milord, that it is impossible to
repatriate a man who has no nationality. No country will receive him.

nature. The civil authorities washed their hands of the matter; it was
better to regularise the position. So Suzanne Legros wedded this Jean,
and their eldest son is now nine years of age. Since that time there has
been no trouble--only Jean still remembers nothing of his origin."

==> "You said in your letter," said Wimsey, "that Jean had now disappeared." <==

"Since five months, milord. It is said that he is in Belgium, buying
pigs, cattle, or I know not what. But he has not written, and his wife
is concerned about him. You think you have some information about him?"

"Since five months, milord. It is said that he is in Belgium, buying

is concerned about him. You think you have some information about him?"

==> "Well," said Wimsey, "we have a corpse. And we have a name. But if this <==
Jean Legros has conducted himself in the manner you describe, then the
name is not his, though the corpse may be. For the man whose name we
have was in prison in 1918 and for some years afterwards."

"Ah! then you have no further interest in Jean Legros?"

in addition to those recently inflicted."

"Aha! that is perhaps some confirmation. He was, then, killed by being
beaten on the head, your unknown?"

==> "No," said Wimsey. "All the head-injuries were inflicted after death. <==
The expert opinion confirms that of the police-surgeon on this point."

"He died, then, of what?"

"There is the mystery. There is no sign of fatal wound, or of poison, or

hands of the military authorities?"

"I do not know, monsieur. My husband--monsieur, I implore you to tell
me, where is my husband?"

==> The commissaire Rozier paused, and glanced at Wimsey, who said: <==

"Madame, we are greatly afraid that your husband is dead."

"_Ah, mon dieu! je le savais bien._ If he had been alive, he would have
written to me."

[line number in individual story] matching line = 6699    window = 6694 6704

"If you will help us by telling us the truth about your husband, we may
be able to identify him."

The woman stood looking from one to the other. At last she turned to

"You, milord, you are not laying a trap for me? You are sure that my
husband is dead?"

"Come, come," said the commissaire, "that makes no difference. You must

husband is dead?"

"Come, come," said the commissaire, "that makes no difference. You must
tell the truth, or it will be the worse for you."

==> Wimsey took out of the attaché case which he had brought with him the <==
underclothing which had been found upon the corpse.

"Madame," he said, "we do not know whether the man who wore these is
your husband, but on my honour, the man who wore these is dead and they
were taken from his body."

milder tone.

"Yes, they are his, I mended these garments myself. I understand that he
is dead."

==> "In that case," said Wimsey, "you can do him no harm by speaking." <==

When Suzanne Legros had recovered herself a little, she made her
statement, the commissaire calling in his attendant gendarme to take a
shorthand note of it.

were so few men left in France, and the War had gone on so long. And
also, monsieur, I grew to love Jean. And his nerves were greatly
deranged. He could not face any more fighting."

"He should have reported to his unit and applied for sick leave," said
==> Wimsey. <==

"But then," said Suzanne, simply, "they would have sent him back to
England and separated us. And besides, the English are very strict. They
might have thought him a coward and shot him."

"But there was a general amnesty for deserters after the War."

"Not in England, monsieur."

==> "He told you that?" said Wimsey. <==

"Yes, milord. So it was important that nobody should know him when he
went to fetch the property. Also there were difficulties which he did
not explain to me, about selling the goods--I do not know what they
were--and for that he had to have the help of a friend. So he wrote to

Again the hesitation. Then: "No, monsieur, I do not know. It is true
that I saw it upon his papers, but I burnt those and I do not now
remember it. But I think it began with a C, and I should know it if I
saw it again."

==> "Was it Cranton?" asked Wimsey. <==

"No, I do not think it was that, but I cannot say what it was. As soon
as he was able to speak at all, he told me to give him his papers, and I
asked him then what his name was, because I could not pronounce it--it
was English and difficult--and he said that he would not tell me his

asked him then what his name was, because I could not pronounce it--it
was English and difficult--and he said that he would not tell me his
name then, but I could call him what I liked. So I called him Jean,
which was the name of my _fiancé_, who was killed."

==> "I see," said Wimsey. He hunted through his pocket-book and laid the <==
official photograph of Cranton before her. "Is that your husband as you
first knew him?"

"No, milord. That is not my husband. It is not in the least like him."
Her face darkened. "You have deceived me. He is not dead and I have

"No, milord. That is not my husband. It is not in the least like him."

and come down here again. He wouldn't come to Dykesey, of course, but he
might have come part of the way by train and done the rest by car or
motor-bike or what-not."

it? And he gets 'flu and can't do the job himself, so he arranges with

"Bless my heart," said Superintendent Blundell. "And what do you suppose
we're to make of that?"

"I think he saw something--or how did he know that the rope was gone
from the cope-chest? But as for hanging, no! He's crazed about hanging.
Got a hanging complex, or whatever they call it. The man wasn't hanged.

buried on the 4th, as far as we can make out. And it can't very well be
December 30th, because Legros only got here on January 1st--if that was
Legros you saw. And besides, I can't make out whether he means Sunday or
Monday, with his boiled pork."

==> "I can," said Wimsey. "He had boiled pork and greens on Sunday, and <==
Parson told him to be thankful and so he was. And on Monday, he had the
pork cold with beans--probably the tinned variety if I know the modern
country-woman--and he felt thankful again. So he went down to the church
to be thankful in the proper place. It would be some time in the
evening, as there was a light in the vestry."

"Thankfulness for Christmas. That looks like December 30th. Why not? You
don't know that Legros didn't get here before January 1st. That's when
Cranton got here."

"But I thought we'd washed Cranton out of it," objected Mr. Blundell,

of pigs, for instance, or the church organ--he's quite good and
reliable."

==> "I see," said Wimsey, "Well, he has been talking a good bit about ropes <==
and hanging."

"Then don't believe a word of it," replied Mrs. Venables, robustly.
"Dear me! here's that Superintendent coming up the drive. I suppose he
wants you."

"Then don't believe a word of it," replied Mrs. Venables, robustly.
"Dear me! here's that Superintendent coming up the drive. I suppose he
wants you."

==> Wimsey caught Mr. Blundell in the garden and headed him away from the <==
house.

"I've seen Thoday," said the Superintendent. "Of course he denies the
whole story. Says Potty was dreaming."

"A colleague, as Sherlock Holmes would say, after my own heart," said

the fairies in the fields'--a lost work by Sir James Barrie, no doubt!
Literary sensation of the year. 'But I saw only the evil elephants with
their black backs.' This is neither rhyme nor reason. Hum! there is a
certain dismal flavour about it suggestive of Potty, but no reference to
hanging, so I conclude that it is not his--he surely couldn't keep King

"I was. Were you coming to see me?"

"Yes."

"Things are moving. What have you got?"

"We've got Cranton."

"I suppose that's a fact. Anyhow, my lord, if we read the cipher and
find the hiding-place, and the stuff's gone, that'll be pretty good
proof that we're working along the right lines."

==> "So it will. But," added Wimsey, as the Superintendent and Bunter piled <==
into the car and were whisked away out of Leamholt at a speed which made
the policeman gasp, "if the emeralds are gone, and Cranton says he
didn't take them, and we can't prove he did, and we can't find out who
Legros really was, or who killed him, why then--where are we?"

Legros really was, or who killed him, why then--where are we?"

"Just where we were before," said Mr. Blundell.

==> "Yes," said Wimsey. "It's like Looking-Glass Country. Takes all the <==
running we can do to stay in the same place."

The Superintendent glanced about him. Flat as a chess-board, and squared
like a chess-board with intersecting dyke and hedge, the fen went
flashing past them.

of the land. Lord!" added Mr. Cranton, "I'd have had 'em cut up and
salted away before you could have said 'knife.' Talk about tracing
them--you'd never have traced them the way I'd have worked it."

"So you went to Fenchurch St. Paul to try and find them, I suppose?"
==> suggested Wimsey. <==

"That's right, I did. And why? Because I knew they must be there. That
swine--you know who I mean----"

"Deacon?"

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 99625    window = 99620 99630


"Why, that woman--Deacon's wife. We had stood shoulder to shoulder, as
you might say, under unfortunate circumstances, and I had no wish to
renew the acquaintance. I never expected to see _her_ in that village,
and, candidly, I thought she showed a lack of taste."

==> "She came back when she married a man named Thoday," said Wimsey. <==

"Married again, did she?" Cranton's eyes narrowed. "Oh, I see. I didn't
know that. Well, I'm damned!"

"Why the surprise?"

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 99702    window = 99697 99707


Mr. Cranton turned extremely white.

"That?" he gasped. "That?--I never----" He fought for breath. "My
heart--here, give me some of the stuff in that glass----"

==> "Give it him," said Wimsey, "he's really bad." <==

Parker gave him the medicine with a grim face. After a time the blue
pallor gave place to a healthier colour, and the breathing became more
natural.

"No; but we might charge you with the murder of Jean Legros."

"No--no--no!" cried Cranton. "It's a lie! I never killed him. I never
killed anybody. I never----"

==> "He's fainted," said Wimsey. <==

"He's dead," said Superintendent Blundell, speaking for the first time.

"I hope to goodness not," said Parker. "No--it's all right, but he looks
pretty queer. Better get hold of that girl. Here, Polly!"

do for you at the moment. The man's not shamming--he's really ill. But
he's holding something out on us. All the same, I don't think it's
murder, somehow. That wouldn't be like Cranton. He knew that paper all
right."

==> "Yes," said Wimsey. "Produced quite a reaction, didn't it? He's <==
frightened about something, Charles. What is it?"

"He's frightened about the murder."

"Well," said Blundell, "it looks to me as though he did it. He admits he

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 99790    window = 99785 99795


"Well," said Blundell, "it looks to me as though he did it. He admits he
was there, and that he ran away on the night the body was buried. If he
didn't do it, who did? He could have got the key of the crypt from the
sexton all right, we know that."

==> "So he could," said Wimsey, "but he was a stranger to the place. How did <==
he know where the sexton kept his tools? Or where to find the bell-rope?
He might have noticed the well, of course, in the day-time, but it's
funny that he should have had the whole scheme so pat. And where does
Legros come into it? If Deacon told Cranton in the dock where to find
the emeralds, where was the sense of bringing Legros to England? He

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 99809    window = 99804 99814


we'll get them."

"And if you do," said Blundell, "then you can arrest that chap for the
murder. Whoever's got the emeralds did the murder. I'm sure of that."

==> "Where thy treasure is, there shall thy heart be also," said Wimsey. <==
"The heart of this crime is down at St. Paul. That's my prophecy,
Charles. Will you have a bet on it?"

"No, I won't," said the Chief Inspector. "You're right too often, Peter,
and I've no money to waste."

[line number in individual story] matching line = 7841    window = 7836 7846

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 99818    window = 99813 99823

==> Wimsey went back to Fenchurch St. Paul and shut himself up with the <==
cipher. He had untwisted cryptograms before, and he felt certain that
this would prove to be a simple one. Whether the inventor was Cranton or
Jean Legros or Will Thoday or any other person connected with the affair
of the Wilbraham emeralds, he was hardly likely to be an expert in the
art of secret writing. Yet the thing had the signs of a cunning hand

[line number in individual story] matching line = 7875    window = 7870 7880

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 99852    window = 99847 99857


counterpoise of the belfry. How had Cranton known where to find them? He
could, of course, have taken them from the sexton's house--if he had
known already. But if "Stephen Driver" had been asking questions about
the church keys, somebody would have taken notice of it. The sexton had
the key of the west door and of the crypt. Had he the other keys as
==> well? Wimsey suddenly turned back and shot the question through the <==
study window at the Rector, who was struggling with the finances of the
Parish Magazine.

Mr. Venables rubbed his forehead.

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 99875    window = 99870 99880



"Jack Godfrey--has he the key of the crypt as well?"

"Oh, no--he doesn't need that."

==> Curiouser and curiouser, thought Wimsey. If the man who left the paper <==
in the bell-chamber was the same man who buried the body, then either he
took _all_ the Rector's keys, or he had access to _two_ sets, and those
two sets had to be Jack Godfrey's (for the key of the counterpoise) and
Gotobed's (for the key of the crypt). And if the man had been Cranton,
then how did he _know_? Of course, the criminal might have brought his

[line number in individual story] matching line = 7905    window = 7900 7910

took _all_ the Rector's keys, or he had access to _two_ sets, and those
two sets had to be Jack Godfrey's (for the key of the counterpoise) and
Gotobed's (for the key of the crypt). And if the man had been Cranton,
then how did he _know_? Of course, the criminal might have brought his
own spade (though that added to the complication). If so, he must have
==> had either the Rector's keys or Jack Godfrey's. Wimsey went round to the <==
back and got hold of Emily and Hinkins. They were both quite sure that
they had never seen the man who called himself Stephen Driver inside the
Rectory gates, much less inside the Rector's study, which was the proper
place for the keys when they were in their proper place.

Gotobed?"

"Well, I don't know," said Emily, "but that's where it was. Harry
Gotobed said he found it there when he went to ring for Early Service."

==> More confused than ever, Wimsey trotted back to the study window. Mr. <==
Venables, arrested with a carrying-figure at the tip of his pen, was at
first not very clear in his recollection, but said presently that he
believed Emily was right.

"I must have left the keys in the vestry the week before," he suggested,

[line number in individual story] matching line = 7940    window = 7935 7945

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 99917    window = 99912 99922


it was Gotobed. Yes, it would be Gotobed, because he would wait behind
to make up the stoves. But it was funny that he should leave the key in
the lock. Dear me! You don't think it could have been the murderer, do
you?"

==> "I do, indeed," said Wimsey. <==

"There now!" exclaimed the Rector. "But if I left the keys in the
vestry, how did he get in to find them? He couldn't get in without the
church key. Unless he came to choir-practice. Surely, nobody belonging
to the choir----"

[line number in individual story] matching line = 7947    window = 7942 7952

"There now!" exclaimed the Rector. "But if I left the keys in the
vestry, how did he get in to find them? He couldn't get in without the
church key. Unless he came to choir-practice. Surely, nobody belonging
to the choir----"

==> The Rector looked horribly distressed. Wimsey hastened to comfort him. <==

"The door would be unlocked during choir-practice. He might have slipped
in then."

"Oh, yes--of course! How stupid I am! No doubt that is what occurred.

[line number in individual story] matching line = 7955    window = 7950 7960

in then."

"Oh, yes--of course! How stupid I am! No doubt that is what occurred.
You have relieved my mind very much."

==> Wimsey had not, however, relieved his own mind. As he resumed his way to <==
the church, he turned the matter over. If the keys had been taken on New
Year's Eve, then Cranton had not taken them. Cranton had not arrived
till New Year's Day. Will Thoday had come, unnecessarily, to the Rectory
on December 30th, and might have taken the keys then, but he had
certainly not been in the church on the night of January 4th to restore

[line number in individual story] matching line = 7963    window = 7958 7968

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 99940    window = 99935 99945


till New Year's Day. Will Thoday had come, unnecessarily, to the Rectory
on December 30th, and might have taken the keys then, but he had
certainly not been in the church on the night of January 4th to restore
them. It remained possible that Will Thoday had taken the keys and the
mysterious James Thoday had returned them--but in that case, what was
==> Cranton doing in the business? And Wimsey felt sure that Cranton knew <==
something about the paper found in the bell-chamber.

Meditating thus, Wimsey let himself into the church, and, unlocking the
door in the tower, made his way up the spiral stair. As he passed
through the ringing-chamber, he noticed with a smile that a new board

them. It remained possible that Will Thoday had taken the keys and the
mysterious James Thoday had returned them--but in that case, what was
Cranton doing in the business? And Wimsey felt sure that Cranton knew
something about the paper found in the bell-chamber.

door in the tower, made his way up the spiral stair. As he passed
through the ringing-chamber, he noticed with a smile that a new board
had made its appearance on the wall, announcing that: "On New Year's

Hours and 15 Minutes, the Ringers being: Treble, Ezra Wilderspin; 2,

Lavender; Theodore Venables, Rector, assisting. Our Mouths shall shew
forth Thy Praise." He passed up through the great, bare clock-chamber,
released the counterpoise and climbed again till he came out beneath the
bells. There he stood for a moment, gazing up into their black mouths

echo seemed to start from the walls and die stealthily among the beams.
Suddenly he shouted in a great voice: "Tailor Paul!" and he must somehow
have hit upon a harmonic of the scale, for a faint brazen note answered
him, remote and menacing, from overhead.

==> "Come!" said Wimsey, pulling himself together, "this won't do. I'm <==
getting as bad as Potty Peake, coming here and talking to the bells.
Let's find the ladder and get to work."

He switched on his torch and turned it on the dim corners of the belfry.
It showed him the ladder, and it showed him something else also. In the

quantity of worm-eaten beams that were stacked against the wall. Here
was a pretty ending to his dreams! Some unlicensed trespasser on
consecrated ground--or possibly some workman legitimately engaged in
repairs to the bell-cage--had spilt his beer and had tidily removed the
stains, while the bottle, rolling out of sight, had been forgotten. No
==> doubt that was all. Yet a lingering suspicion caused Wimsey to take up <==
the bottle very carefully, by means of a finger inserted into the neck.
It was not very dusty. It could not, he thought, have lain there long.
It would bear somebody's finger-prints--perhaps.

He examined the rest of the floor very carefully, but could find only a

to convey some superficial and misleading information. I see, for
instance, that you already have the word WON and the Scotch expression
NAE. Could not the idea be extended further, so that the entire passage
might appear completely innocuous?"

==> "Of course it could. It might look like this." Wimsey flicked Jean <==
Legros' communication with his finger.

"Have you----? But pardon me. I am unwarrantably interfering.
Still--have you tried this method on the cryptogram?"

Legros' communication with his finger.

"Have you----? But pardon me. I am unwarrantably interfering.
Still--have you tried this method on the cryptogram?"

==> "Well, I haven't," admitted Wimsey. "I've only just thought of it. <==
Besides, what would be the good of sending a message like that to
Cranton, who probably knows nothing about bell-ringing? And it would
take a bell-ringer to write it, and we have no reason to suppose that
Jean Legros was a ringer. It is true," he added thoughtfully, "that we
have no reason to suppose he was not."

was sent, though not himself a ringer and not knowing how to interpret
it, have connected it in his mind with the bells and supposed that the
key was to be found in the belfry? No doubt I am very foolish, but it
appears to me to be possible."

==> Wimsey struck his hand on the table. <==

"Padre, that's an idea! When Cranton came to Fenchurch St. Paul, he
asked for Paul Taylor, because Deacon had told him that Tailor Paul or
Batty Thomas knew where the emeralds were. Come on! Have at it. We'll
ask Tailor Paul ourselves."

interpretation is even more perplexing than the cipher."

a sermon about evil being over-ruled for good. But I should never have
thought of the possibility that one might make a cipher out of

with supposing. The point is, what the dickens is one to do with 99. 1.

to the Red Cow for a pint of beer.

"Bitter, my lord?" inquired Mr. Donnington with his hand upon the tap.

Mr. Donnington produced the Bass, observing that his lordship would find

don't recommend it, but Bass _must_ be stood right ways up and not shook

this. Your health. Won't you take something yourself?"

"Thank you, my lord, I don't mind if I do. Here's luck. Now, that," said

likes the quarts delivered at their homes. Ah! in the old days they all

Mr. Donnington observed with pleasure that in that case the sexton owed
him half a crown, and while he made a note of the fact on the back of an

"Will Thoday, he had a few while Jim was at home--a dozen or so, it

telling his tales of foreign parts. He brought back that there parrot

surprising in a clergyman. But there, poor man! He had a bit of a
weakness, as they say. 'Do as I say, don't do as I do'--that's what he
used to say in his sermons. Terrible red in the face he were, and died
sudden, of a stroke."

==> Wimsey tried in vain to steer the conversation back to Jim Thoday. Mrs. <==
Tebbutt was fairly launched into reminiscences of Old Rector, and it was
half an hour before he was able to make his way out of the Wheatsheaf.
Turning back towards the Rectory, he found himself at Will Thoday's
gate. Glancing up the path, he saw Mary, engaged in hanging out washing.
He suddenly determined on a frontal attack.

"Yes, my lord. Him that was at Ezra Wilderspin's. I remember seeing him
once or twice. They said at the inquest that the body might have been
him."

"Wasn't it, my lord?"

"No. Because we've found this chap Driver and he's still alive and
kicking. Had you ever seen Driver before he came here?"

"No, my lord."

She appeared to be answering quite frankly, and he could not see any
signs of alarm in voice or expression.

Paul because he thought you had recognised him."

"Did he? Well, that's a strange thing, my lord."

She sat down on a bench and stared at the photograph.

"That I never had, my lord. If I'd ever had such a thought, I'd have
spoken to him, don't you fear! I'd have got out of him where he put
those emeralds to. You see, my lord, that was what went so hard against
my poor husband, this man saying as my husband had kept the necklace

London on my hands and knees to give it back to Mrs. Wilbraham. I know
what poor Sir Henry suffered with the loss of it. The police searched
our place, and I searched it myself, over and over----"

==> "Couldn't you take Deacon's word for it?" asked Wimsey, softly. <==

She hesitated, and her eyes clouded with pain.

"My lord, I did believe him. And yet, all the same--well! it was such a
terrible shock to me that he could have done such a thing as rob a lady

"That writing? Why, of course----"

"Shut up you fool! Shut up you bloody fool! Come on, Joey! Show a leg
there!"

==> "Good lord!" exclaimed Wimsey, startled. Peering round the door into the <==
inner room, he encountered the bright eye of a grey African parrot fixed
knowingly upon him. At sight of a stranger, the bird stopped talking,
cocked its head aslant, and began to sidle along its perch.

"Damn your eyes!" said his lordship, pleasantly. "You made me jump."

from Mrs. Tebbutt."

"Yes, my lord, that's him. He's a wonderful talker, but he does swear
and that's the truth."

Let me see--what were we----? Oh, yes, that bit of writing. You were
just saying----"

==> Wimsey could have sworn that she had been going to say just the <==
opposite. She was looking at--no, not at, but through and past him, with
the face of someone who sees an incredible catastrophe approaching.

"It's queer-looking stuff, isn't it?" she went on, in a flat voice,
"don't seem to mean anything. What made you think I should know anything

"Shut up, you fool! Joey, Joey, Joey! Scratch a poll, then. Aw!"

"Where did that come from?"

"What? Oh, this? It was picked up in the church, and we had an idea it
might be Cranton's. But he says it isn't, you know."

"He goes on like that," she said. "Gets on my nerves. He picked it up
the night Will was so bad. They were ringing the peal, and it worried
him, like, that he couldn't be there. Will gets that angry with Joey
when he starts mocking him. Shut up, now, Joey, do."

==> Wimsey held out his hand for the cryptogram, which Mary <==
surrendered--reluctantly, he thought, and as though her thoughts were
elsewhere.

"Well, I mustn't bother you any more, Mrs. Thoday. I just wanted to
clear up that little point about Cranton. I expect you are right after

after him. It's a queer business altogether. As regards that cipher,
what do you say to sending it along to the Governor of Maidstone? If
this fellow Legros or Taylor or whatever he is was ever in there, they
may be able to spot the handwriting."

==> "So they may," said Wimsey, thoughtfully. "Yes, we'll do that. And I'm <==
hoping we'll hear from M. Rozier again soon. The French haven't any of
our inhibitions about dealing with witnesses."

"Lucky them, my lord," replied Mr. Blundell, with fervour.

"Don't rub it in, I'm hopelessly stuck."

"I shouldn't worry," said Mr. Venables. "Even if you have to lie still a
whole pull now and again, you'll soon find yourself back in the hunt."

==> "I wouldn't mind that," said Wimsey. "It's lying behind the whole way <==
that gets on my nerves."

"There's always something that lies behind a mystery," said the Rector,
mildly enjoying his little witticism. "A solution of some kind."

Anxiety about the Thodays was somewhat allayed by their appearance
==> together at Matins, but Wimsey thought he had never seen two people look <==
so ill and unhappy. In wondering about them, he lost all consciousness
of what was going on about him, sat down for the Venite, lost the Psalms
for the day, embarked on a loud and solitary "For thine is the Kingdom"
at the end of the second "Our Father," and only pulled himself together
when Mr. Venables came down to preach his sermon. As usual, Mr. Gotobed

for the day, embarked on a loud and solitary "For thine is the Kingdom"
at the end of the second "Our Father," and only pulled himself together
when Mr. Venables came down to preach his sermon. As usual, Mr. Gotobed
had failed to sweep the chancel properly, and a hideous crunching of
coke proclaimed the Rector's passage to the pulpit. The Invocation was
==> pronounced, and Wimsey sank back with a sigh of relief into the corner <==
of the pew, folded his arms and fixed his gaze firmly on the roof.

"Who hast exalted thine only Son with great triumph into the Heavens.
Those words are from the collect for the day. What do they mean to us?
What picture do we make of the glory and triumph of Heaven? Last

crystal sea and the Lord sitting between the cherubims, and the angels
with their harps and crowns of gold, as the old craftsmen imagined them
when they built this beautiful roof that we are so proud of--but do we,
do you and I really believe----?"

==> It was hopeless. Wimsey's thoughts were far away again. "He rode upon <==
the cherubim and did fly. He sitteth between the cherubims." He was
suddenly reminded of the little architect who had come down to advise
about the church roof at Duke's Denver. "You see, your Grace, the rot
has got into the timbers; there are holes behind those cherrybims you
could put your hand in." _He sitteth between the cherubims._ Why, of

Then, if the handwriting of the cryptogram could be traced back to
Maidstone Gaol and to Jean Legros, they would know who Legros was, and
with luck they would also link him up with Cranton. After that, if
Cranton could escape from the murder charge, he would be a lucky man.

==> Over the Sunday beef and Yorkshire pudding, Wimsey tackled the Rector. <==

"How long ago was it, sir, that you took away the galleries from the
aisles?"

"Let me see," said Mr. Venables, "about ten years ago, I think. Yes,

"I'm afraid we're a day after the fair. Though I'm pretty sure it was in
this parish up to last January."

"In the parish? Where?"

==> "I think it was in the church," said Wimsey. "That was a very powerful <==
sermon of yours this morning, padre. Very inspiring. It inspired me to
guess the riddle of the cryptogram."

"No!" exclaimed the Rector. "How did it do that, I wonder?"

sermon of yours this morning, padre. Very inspiring. It inspired me to

"No!" exclaimed the Rector. "How did it do that, I wonder?"

"Good gracious! How very remarkable! We must investigate the place at
once."

"Not at once, Theodore."

"Of course, he was sitting up there that morning. Now I understand why
you asked so many questions about the gallery. What a sad villain the
man must have been! He really did--what is that word they use when one
malefactor deceives another?"

==> "Double-cross?" suggested Wimsey. <==

"Ah! that is the very expression I was looking for. He did double-cross
his accomplice. Poor man! I mean the accomplice. Ten years in prison for
a theft of which he never enjoyed the fruits. One cannot help feeling
some sympathy for him. But in that case, Lord Peter, who constructed the

excitement.

"We've got that letter from Maidstone," he announced, "and whose do you
suppose the writing is?"

==> "I've been thinking it over," said Wimsey. "I think it must have been <==
Deacon's."

"There!" said Mr. Blundell, disappointed. "Well, you're quite right, my
lord; it is."


[line number in individual story] matching line = 8944    window = 8939 8949

Deacon's."

"There!" said Mr. Blundell, disappointed. "Well, you're quite right, my
lord; it is."

==> "It must be the original cipher," said Wimsey. "When we found out that <==
it had to do with bell-ringing, I realised that Deacon must be the
author. To have two bell-ringing convicts in Maidstone Gaol at once
seemed rather too much of a coincidence. And then, when I showed the
paper to Mrs. Thoday, I felt sure that she recognised the writing. It
might have meant that Legros had written to her, but it was still more

might have meant that Legros had written to her, but it was still more
likely that she knew it to be her husband's."

"Well, then, how did it come to be written on that foreign paper?"

==> "Foreign paper is much of a muchness," said Wimsey. "Did Lady Thorpe <==
ever have a foreign maid? Old Lady Thorpe, I mean."

"Sir Charles had a French cook," said the Superintendent.

"At the time of the theft?"

"Good God!"

"You may say so, my lord. Oh, we'll have them, don't you fear. Gone off,
that's what they've done, and the emeralds with them."

==> "I admit," said Wimsey, "I didn't expect that." <==

"Didn't you?" said Mr. Blundell. "Well, I didn't either, or I'd have
kept a sharper eye on them. And by the way, we know now who that Legros
fellow was."

Officially, that is. Last actual news of him--over there!"

The Superintendent jerked his thumb in the general direction of the
churchyard.

"It makes no sense, Super, it makes no sense! If this man Cobbleigh
joins up in the first year of the War, how on earth could he have been
elaborately in league with Deacon, who went to Maidstone in 1914? There
was no time. Damn it! You don't get a man out of quod in a few spare

tail of. Then he has another look at Deacon and sees he's done him in
good and proper. 'Oh, hell!' says he, 'that's torn it. I better shove
him out of the way and clear off.' So he pops him down the hole and
makes tracks for France. How's that, so far?"

==> "Fine, full-blooded stuff," said Wimsey. "But why should Deacon be <==
carrying a note of the hiding-place about with him? And how did it come
to be written on foreign paper?"

"I don't know. Well, say it was like you said before. Say he'd given the
paper to his wife. He spills his wife's address, like a fool, and then

"I can't answer everything at once, can I? That's the way it was done
between 'em, you can take it from me. And now I'm going to have Cranton
charged, and get hold of those precious Thodays, and if I don't put my
hand on the emeralds among them, I'll eat my hat."

Rector solved the cipher----"

The Rector had procured the sexton's ladder and was already up in the
south aisle roof, covering himself with cobwebs as he poked about
vaguely among the ancient oak.

Superintendent. "But now I come to think of it, we had the painters up
here last year, and they ought to have found anything there was to be

"Yes, my lord. We never made out what that was for."

the pirate's hoard." His long fingers were working over the beams,
gently pulling at the thick wooden pegs which held them together. "He
must have been able to reach it from where he sat. Aha! what did I tell
you? This is the one. Wriggle her gently and out she comes. Look!"

it had passed right through the beam and must have been over a foot in
length, tapering from the size of a penny-piece at one end to something
over half-an-inch at the other. But at some time it had been sawn off
about three inches from the thick end.

==> "There you are," said Wimsey. "An old schoolboy cache originally, I <==
expect. Some kid got pushing it from the other end and found it was
loose. Probably shoved it clean out. At least, that's what I did, up in
the attic. Then he took it home and sawed six inches or so out of the
middle of it. Next time he comes to church he brings a short rod with
him. He pushes the thin end back again into place with the rod, so that

they've been searching ever since."

"Amazing!" said the Rector. Mr. Blundell uttered a regrettable
expression, remembered his surroundings and coughed loudly.

==> "So now we see what the hook was for," said Wimsey. "When Legros, or <==
Cobbleigh, whichever you like to call him, came for the loot----"

"Stop a minute," objected the Superintendent. "That cipher didn't
mention anything about a hole, did it? It only mentioned cherubims. How
did he know he needed a hook to get necklaces out of cherubims?"

"You'd think he might have waited for a better place to do it in,
wouldn't you, my lord? Putting him out here in the church, and all that
bother of burying him and what not. Why didn't he go while the going was
good, and shove Cobbleigh into the dyke or something on the way home?"

==> "Heaven knows," said Wimsey. "Anyhow, there's your hiding-place and <==
there's the explanation of your hook." He thrust the end of his fountain
pen into the hole. "It's quite a deep--no, by Jove, it's not! it's only
a shallow hole after all, not much longer than the peg. We can't,
surely, have made a mistake. Where's my torch? Dash it! (Sorry, padre).

"Run across to the Rectory and ask Hinkins," suggested Mr. Venables,
helpfully.

In a few minutes' time, Mr. Blundell returned, panting, with a short

was examining the narrow end of the oaken peg on the east side of the
beam. He set one end of the bar firmly against the peg and smote lustily
with the spanner. An ecclesiastical bat, startled from its resting-place
by the jar, swooped out with a shriek, the tapered end of the peg shot
smartly through the hole and out at the other side, and something else

across with some sort of story, judge's rules or no judge's rules, even
if it breaks me."

difficult."

"Why within a fortnight?"

Before leaving Fenchurch St. Paul, he went and stood in the churchyard.
The grave of the unknown victim still stood raw and black amid the

with green turves. Not far away there was an ancient box tomb; Hezekiah
Lavender was seated on the slab, carefully cleaning the letters of the

He left Hezekiah and went into the church, stepping softly as though he
feared to rouse up something from its sleep. Abbot Thomas was quiet in

couldn't hope to get away with it."

"That's it. Deacon said it was like being among people talking a foreign
language. Worse; because Deacon did know a bit about foreign languages.

"That's a very remarkable story," said Mr. Parker.

transport, bound for Dover, I suppose."

"That's right," said Mr. Cranton. "Caught in the machine, as you might

done about a hundred miles, but I daresay that was an exaggeration. And
he said there was a noise like merry hell going on ahead, and the ground

you."

"Yes, _you_ know," said Nobby, eagerly. "Well, I'd got to where I

tripped over something on the way, too, that made an awful clatter.
Something like a big metal pot."

on William Thoday's. It was the face of a man pushed to the last
extremity, haggard and grey, and pinched about the nostrils like a dead
man's. On Mary's face there was anxiety and distress, but something
combative and alert as well. She was still fighting, but Will was
obviously beaten.

job to find out who did it."

"I ain't got nothing to say about that," said Will Thoday, slowly. "But
it's cruel hard if Mary and me----"

==> "Just a moment," said Wimsey. "I don't think you quite realise the <==
position, Thoday. Mr. Blundell doesn't want to stand in the way of your
marriage, but, as he says, somebody did murder Deacon, and the ugly fact
remains that you were the man with the best cause to do it. And that
means, supposing a charge were laid against you, and brought into
court--well, they might want this lady to give evidence."

means, supposing a charge were laid against you, and brought into

"And if they did?" said Will.

evidence against her husband." He waited while this sank in. "Have a
cigarette, Thoday. Think it out."

end to the wrong that devil done us. He ruined my poor Mary and brought

bastards of our little girls, and now he can come between us again at
the altar rails and drive her into the witness-box to put my neck in the
rope. If ever a man deserved killing, he's the one, and I hope he's
burning in hell for it now."

==> "Very likely he is," said Wimsey, "but you see the point. If you don't <==
tell us the truth now----"

"I've nothing to tell you but this," broke out Thoday in a kind of
desperation. "My wife--and she _is_ my wife in God's sight and mine--she
never knew nothing about it. Not one word. And she knows nothing now,

nothing but the name of the man rotting in that grave. And that's the
truth as God sees us."

"Well," said Mr. Blundell, "you'll have to prove that."

be proved. Mrs. Thoday----"

The woman looked quickly and gratefully at him.

"But last Sunday you stayed away."

wasn't properly married. It didn't seem right, like."

afraid I interrupted you," he added, blandly.

"That's all very well," said Mr. Blundell. "You said you didn't
recognise that writing when his lordship showed it to you."

"I say, Yes. If you hadn't have known something, you'd have had no cause
to deny the writing. You knew _when_ it was written--now, didn't you?"

"That's a lie!" said Thoday.

==> "I really don't think you're right about that, Blundell," said Wimsey, <==
mildly, "because, if Mrs. Thoday had known about it all along, why
shouldn't she have gone to Church last Sunday morning? I mean, don't you
see, if she'd brazened it out all those months, why shouldn't she do it
again?"

Mary Thoday hesitated.

"I can't tell you about that," she said at last.

They'll only twist your words round into what you don't mean. We've got
nothing to say and if I got to go through it, I got to go through it and
that's all about it."

==> "Not quite," said Wimsey. "Don't you see that if you tell us what you <==
know, and we're satisfied that your wife knows nothing--then there's
nothing to prevent your marriage from going through straight away?
That's right, isn't it, Super?"

"Can't hold out any inducement, my lord," said the Superintendent,

"Stop that!" said Thoday. "You say another word and I'll----Oh, my God!
it wasn't that, my lord. She never knew. I did know. I'll say that much,
I won't say no more, only that. As I hope to be saved, she never knew a

and that's all you've got to tell us?"

Thoday, "and I said to myself----"

fancy. 'That was what he----?' What?' That was what he was after when I
found him in the church.' Was that it?"

"No, my lord. I was going to say----I was just going to say, that was
what he did with them." A fresh wave of anger seemed to sweep over him.

"Never mind," growled the farmer. "How did he come to be in France? How
did he----?"

issue. Now, let's get your story clear. You heard that the body of a man
who might have been a convict had been found in the churchyard, and
though the face was quite unrecognisable, you were--shall we say
inspired?--to identify him with Geoffrey Deacon, whom you had supposed
to have died in 1918. You said nothing about it till your wife, the

and tell it to a judge and jury. Or you can come clean now. Whichever
you like. See?"

"I've nothing more to say, Mr. Blundell."

==> "I tell thee all, I can no more," observed Wimsey thoughtfully. "That's <==
a pity, because the public prosecutor may get quite a different sort of
story fixed in his mind. He may think, for instance, that you knew
Deacon was alive because you had met him in the church on the night of
December 30th."

Jim? By the way, Jim is coming home and we'll have to have a word with

"I'm not saying anything one way or other, my lord, except this. I've

that's the truth."

30th and January 4th, somebody killed Deacon. And on the night of the
4th, somebody buried the body. Somebody who knew him and took care to
mutilate his face and hands beyond recognition. And what everybody will
want to know is, at what moment did Deacon cease to be Deacon and become
the body? Because that's rather the point, isn't it? We know that you

"No, my lord, I haven't. I've sent him home and told him to think it
over. Of course, we could easily get him on being an accessory after the
fact in both cases. I mean, he was shielding a known murderer--that's
pretty clear, I fancy; and he's also shielding whoever killed Deacon, if

wouldn't want it. On the other hand, if Deacon wasn't killed till the
4th, who fed him in the interval? If James killed him, why did he
trouble to feed him first? The thing makes no sense."

said something infuriatin' and the somebody killed him all of a sudden
in a frenzy, not meaning to?"

"Yes, but how did he kill him? He wasn't stabbed or shot or clouted over

straitened means and anxiety throughout the intervening period seemed to
be only what anybody might have expected from her enigmatic and
secretive disposition. A codicil, dated on the day after Henry's death,
transferred the legacy to Hilary, while a further codicil, executed a
few days before her own death, not only directed that the emeralds which

who seems to be a sensible man and to have acted without interested
motives," but also made him Hilary's trustee. Lord Peter made a wry face
over this bequest. He offered the necklace to Hilary, but she refused to
touch it; it had painful associations for her. It was, indeed, only with
difficulty that she was persuaded to accept the Wilbraham estate. She

said. "He will want me to marry some horrible rich man, and if I want to
marry a poor one, he'll say he's after the money. And anyway, I don't
want to marry anybody."

"And get like Aunt Wilbraham? Not me!"

"Of course not. Be a nice wealthy spinster."

Wilbraham's next-of-kin, and they'd be sure to do something silly with
it."

"Uncle Edward would," said Hilary, thoughtfully.

==> "Well, you've got a few years to think it over," said Wimsey. "When <==
you're of age, you can see about throwing it into the Thames. But what
I'm to do with the emeralds I really don't know."

"Beastly things," said Hilary. "They've killed grandfather, and

"I'll tell you what. I'll keep them till you're twenty-one, and then
we'll form ourselves into a Wilbraham Estate Disposals Committee and do
something exciting with the whole lot."

==> Hilary agreed; but Wimsey felt depressed. So far as he could see, his <==
interference had done no good to anybody and only made extra trouble. It
was a thousand pities that the body of Deacon had ever come to light at
all. Nobody wanted it.

And the River Wale, placidly doing its job in the midst of all the

leaning over the wall at the entry to the Cut, watched the salt water
moving upward with the incoming tide, muddied and chafing along its
new-made bed. On his left, the crooked channel of the old river lay
empty of its waters, a smooth expanse of shining mud.

went wrong was in dispersing it into canals and letting it lie about all
over the place. The smaller the fall of the land, the bigger weight of
water you need to keep the outfall scoured. You'd think it was obvious,
wouldn't you? But it's taken people hundreds of years to learn it."

==> "Yes," said Wimsey. "I suppose all this extra water will go up the <==
Thirty-Foot?"

"That's right. It's practically a straight run now from the Old Bank
Sluice to the New Cut Outfall--thirty-five miles--and this will carry
off a lot of the High Level water from Leamholt and Lympsey. At present

it would have overflowed the old river-bed and drowned the town. But now
the New Cut will carry it clean off, and that will relieve the Great
Leam and obviate the floods round Frogglesham, Mere Wash and Lympsey
Fen."

==> "Oh!" said Wimsey. "I suppose the Thirty-Foot Dyke will stand the <==
strain?"

"Oh, dear, yes," said the engineer, cheerfully. "It was meant to from
the beginning. In fact, at one time, it had to. It's only within the
last hundred years that the Wale has got so badly silted up. There's

been a good deal of shifting in the Wash--chiefly owing to tidal action,
of course, and the Nene Outfall Cut, and that helped to cause the
obstruction, don't you see. But the Thirty-Foot worked all right in the
old days."

==> "In the Lord Protector's time, I suppose," said Wimsey. "And now you've <==
cleared the Wale Outfall, no doubt the obstruction will go somewhere
else."

"Very likely," replied the engineer, with unimpaired cheerfulness.
"These mudbanks are always shifting about. But in time I daresay they'll

"Very likely," replied the engineer, with unimpaired cheerfulness.
"These mudbanks are always shifting about. But in time I daresay they'll
clear the whole thing--unless, of course, they really take it into their
heads to drain the Wash and make a job of it."

==> "Just so," said Wimsey. <==

"But as far as it goes," continued the engineer, "this looks pretty
good. It's to be hoped our dam over there will stand up to the strain.
You'd be surprised at the scour you get with these quiet-looking rivers.
Anyhow, this embankment is all right--I'll take my oath of that. You

He hurried off to superintend the workmen who were completing the dam
across the old course of the river.

"And how about my old sluice-gates?"

==> "Oh!" said Wimsey, looking round, "it's you, is it?" <==

"Ah!" The sluice-keeper spat copiously into the rising water. "It's me.
That's who it is. Look at all this money they been spending. Thousands.
But as for them gates of mine, I reckon I can go and whistle for 'em."

it?"

"Ah!" said the sluice-keeper. "Always interfering with things, they
are."

"They're not interfering with your gates, anyway."

interferin' with things you got to go on. One thing leads to another.
Let 'm bide, that's what I say. Don't go digging of 'em up and altering
of 'em. Dig up one thing and you got to dig up another."

water."

"Well, in a manner of speaking, so they would," admitted the
sluice-keeper. "That's very true. So they would. But none the more for

"Well, it's their water, ain't it?" said the sluice-keeper. "They ain't
got no call to send it down here."

==> "Quite," said Wimsey, recognising the spirit that had hampered the Fen <==
drainage for the last few hundred years, "but as you say yourself, it's
got to go somewhere."

"It's their water," retorted the man obstinately, "let 'em keep it. It

'how about a new set o' gates for my sluice?' 'That ain't in our
contract,' he says. 'No,' I says, 'and drowning half the parish ain't in
your contract neither, I suppose.' But he couldn't see it."

==> "Well, cheer up," said Wimsey. "Have a drink." <==

He did, however, feel sufficient interest in the matter to speak to the
engineer about it when he saw him again.

"Oh, I think it's all right," said that gentleman. "We did, as a matter

undertaken to make up their embankment and put in some fresh stonework.
If they don't, there'll be trouble, but they can't say we haven't warned
them."

wish we'd never dug up Deacon. Once you let the tide in, it's got to go

some papers. There was some made out in the name of Taylor and some in a

then I had a look at his hands."

"Yes, my lord. You must remember that I knew Deacon. Not very well, but
I knew him. And he carried a big scar on one hand, where he'd fallen
down one day, carrying a tray with a glass jug on it. I'd seen that
scar, and I'd never forget it. When I saw that, my lord, and knew who

while heartily wishing that the whole business could have been settled
in London, liked the girl for her determination to stick to the family
estate. Here again, Wimsey was a power in the land. He could put the
property in order if he liked and pay off the mortgages, and that would
no doubt be a satisfaction to Mr. Thorpe, who had no power to sell under
==> the terms of his trust. A final deciding factor was that if Wimsey did <==
not spend Christmas at Fenchurch, he would have no decent excuse for not
spending it with his brother's family at Denver, and of all things in
the world, a Christmas at Denver was most disagreeable to him.

Accordingly, he looked in at Denver for a day or two, irritated his

Accordingly, he looked in at Denver for a day or two, irritated his
sister-in-law and her guests as much as, and no more than, usual and
thence, on Christmas Eve, made his way across country to Fenchurch St.
Paul.

==> "They seem," said Wimsey, "to keep a special brand of disgusting weather <==
in these parts." He thrust up his hand against the hood of the car,
discharging a deluge of water. "Last time it was snowing and now it's
pelting cats and dogs. There's a fate in it, Bunter."

"Yes, my lord," said that long-suffering man. He was deeply attached to

and here and there fragments of timber filched from the drowned lands of
the Upper Fen. And even while he watched, there came a change. Angry
little waves and gurges ruffled the strong flow of the river, with an
appearance as of repressed tumult and conflict. A man came out of the
gate-house by the bridge and took up his position by the sluice, staring
==> down into the river. Wimsey hailed him. <==

"Tide coming up?"

"Yes, sir. We has to watch her now if we don't want to get the water all
across the causey. But she don't rise very far, not without there's an

sluice."

"That's it, sir," said the man with a grin. "And if the flood-water
carries the tide back, we might drown _you_. It all depends, you see."

==> "Then we'll hope you manipulate things in our favour," said Wimsey, <==
cheerfully. The rush of water through the arches was slackening now with
the lowering of the sluice-gates, the whirlpools became shallower, and
the floating sticks and reeds began to eddy against the piles of the
bridge. "Just hold her back for a bit till we get to Fenchurch, there's
a good fellow."

a good fellow."

"Oh, we'll keep her level, don't you be afraid," said the man,
reassuringly. "There ain't nothing wrong wi' _this_ here sluice."

==> He put such marked emphasis on the word "this" that Wimsey looked <==
sharply at him.

"How about Van Leyden's Sluice?"

The man shook his head.

something o' that, I reckon. But you can't do nothing much for they
gates in flood-time. Mebbe they'll hold, mebbe they won't. It's all
according."

==> "Well, that's jolly," said Wimsey. "Come on, Bunter. Have you made your <==
will? We'd better go while the going's good."

Their way this time lay along the south bank or Fenchurch side of the
Thirty-foot. Dyke and drain were everywhere abrim and here and there the
water stood in the soaked fields as though they needed but little more

streaming rain with an aching and intolerable melancholy, like the noise
of the bells of a drowned city pulsing up through the overwhelming sea.

They turned the corner beneath the great grey tower and passed by the
Rectory wall. As they neared the gate a blast of familiar toots smote
==> upon their ears, and Wimsey slackened speed as the Rector's car came <==
cautiously nosing its way into the road. Mr. Venables recognised the
Daimler immediately, and stopped his engine with the Morris halfway
across the road. His hand waved cheerfully to them through the
side-curtains.

He chugged off cheerfully, beaming round at them through the discoloured

House.

Christmas was over. Uncle Edward, sourly and reluctantly, had given way,
==> and Hilary Thorpe's career was decided. Wimsey had exerted himself nobly <==
in other directions. On Christmas Eve, he had gone out with the Rector
and the Choir and sung "Good King Wenceslas" in the drenching rain,
returning to eat cold roast beef and trifle at the Rectory. He had taken
no part in the Stedman's Triples, but had assisted Mrs. Venables to tie
wet bunches of holly and ivy to the font, and attended Church twice on

Christmas Day, and helped to bring two women and their infants to be
churched and christened from a remote and muddy row of cottages two
miles beyond the Drain.

On Boxing Day, the rain ceased, and was followed by what the Rector
==> described as "a tempestous wind called Euroclydon." Wimsey, taking <==
advantage of a dry road and a clear sky, ran over to see his friends at
Walbeach and stayed the night, hearing great praises of the New Wash Cut
and the improvement it had brought to the harbour and the town.

He returned to Fenchurch St. Paul after lunch, skimming merrily along

She's held this tide, but she'll go the next with this wind and the tide

there's no time to lose."

"A regiment of men couldn't do nothing now, my lord. They old gates is

carrying, cheering and exhorting, helping to stall cattle and making
himself as useful as he could. At length he remembered his duty as a
messenger and extricating his car from the crowd made his way east along
the Thirty-foot. It was growing dark, and the road was thronged with
carts and cattle, hurrying to the safety of Church Hill. Pigs and cattle

impeded his progress.

twilight, "the elephant and the kangaroo. Hurrah!"

Down at the sluice, the situation looked dangerous. Barges had been
drawn against both sides of the gates and an attempt had been made to
buttress the sluice with beams and sandbags, but the piers were bulging

The sluice-keeper was wringing his hands.

"I told 'em, I told 'em! What will become on us?"

"An hour, my lord, if that."

"You'd better all get away. Have you cars enough?"

"I'll hang on here till the rest go, my lord, thank you. But tell them
to lose no time."

==> Wimsey turned the car back again. In the short time that he had been <==
away the organisation had almost completed itself. Men, women, children
and household goods had been packed into the church. It was nearly seven
o'clock and the dusk had fallen. The lamps were lit. Soup and tea were
being served in the Lady chapel, babies were crying, the churchyard
resounded with the forlorn lowing of cattle and the terrified bleating

transverse beams that carried the footway over the weir, rocking and

over in a tumult to meet the battering force of the tide. There was a

Somebody scrambled in beside him. It was the sluice-keeper, still
moaning, "I told 'em, I told 'em!" Another thunderous crash brought down
the weir across the Thirty-foot, in a deluge of tossing timbers. Beams
and barges were whirled together like straws, and a great spout of water
raged over the bank and flung itself across the road. Then the sluice,

Before the cars reached St. Paul, the flood was rising and pursuing

fled through the dusk, and behind and on their left, the great silver

That is just what I should have expected of him. A dear, good fellow in

Then came a long, wailing cry from the back of the church:

"Will! Oh, Will! He didn't want to live! Oh, my poor children--what
shall we do?"

==> Wimsey did not wait to hear any more. He made his way down to the belfry <==
door and climbed the stair to the ringing chamber. The bells were still
sounding their frenzied call. He passed the sweating ringers and climbed
again--up through the clock-chamber, piled with household goods, and up
and on to the bell-chamber itself. As his head rose through the floor,
the brazen fury of the bells fell about his ears like the blows from a

again--up through the clock-chamber, piled with household goods, and up

the brazen fury of the bells fell about his ears like the blows from a
thousand beating hammers. The whole tower was drenched and drunken with
noise. It rocked and reeled with the reeling of the bells, and staggered
==> like a drunken man. Stunned and shaken, Wimsey set his foot on the last <==
ladder.

Half-way up he stopped, clinging desperately with his hands. He was
pierced through and buffeted by the clamour. Through the brazen crash
and clatter there went one high note, shrill and sustained, that was

Jericho, Jubilee, Dimity and Batty Thomas lowered their shouting mouths
and were at peace, and in their sudden stillness, Tailor Paul tolled out
the Nine Tailors for two souls passed in the night. The notes of the
organ rose solemnly.

==> Wimsey crept down from the tower. Into the ringing-chamber, where old <==
Hezekiah still stood to his bell, streamed light and sound from the
crowded church. The Rector's voice, musical and small, came floating up,
past the wings of the floating cherubim:

"Lighten our darkness...."

brief service of hymns and prayer was held, to the accompaniment of
culinary clinkings and odours from the Lady chapel. Breakfast, prepared
under Bunter's directions, was distributed along the pews by members of
the Women's Institute, and when this was over, the duties of the day
were put in hand. Daily school was carried on in the south aisle; games

from somebody's front garden, as the nearest substitute for an
olive-branch. That day they rang a merry peal of Kent Treble Bob Major,

The bodies of Will Thoday and John Cross were recovered from the streets
of St. Stephen, whither the flood had brought them, and buried beneath
the shadow of St. Paul's tower, with all the solemnity of a muffled

opened his mind to the Rector and to Superintendent Blundell.

"Poor Will," he said, "he died finely and his sins died with him. He

"What do you mean, my lord?"

"Murderers?" asked the Superintendent, quickly. "More than one? Who were

"My God!" said the Superintendent. "Why then, you were right, my lord,
when you said that Rector, or you, or Hezekiah might have murdered him."

==> "I was right," said Wimsey. "We did." He thought for a moment and spoke <==
again. "The noise must have been worse that night than it was the other
day--think how the snow choked the louvres and kept it pent up in the
tower. Geoffrey Deacon was a bad man, but when I think of the helpless
horror of his lonely and intolerable death-agony----"

Right and left, before and behind, the fen lay shrouded. It was past
four o'clock and New Year's Eve; the snow that had fallen all day gave
back a glimmering greyness to a sky like lead.

"I'm sorry," said Wimsey. "Whereabouts do you suppose we've got to,
==> Bunter?" <==

The manservant consulted a map in the ray of an electric torch.

"I think, my lord, we must have run off the proper road at Leamholt.
Unless I am much mistaken, we must be near Fenchurch St. Paul."

on in silence, the snow beating on their eyelids. At the end of a
solitary mile the gaunt shape of a windmill loomed up upon the farther
bank of the drain, but no bridge led to it, and no light showed.

Another half-mile, and they came to a signpost and a secondary road that
==> turned off to the right. Bunter turned his torch upon the signpost and <==
read upon the single arm:

"Fenchurch St. Paul."

There was no other direction; ahead, road and dyke marched on side by

mentioned it earlier. I am, as you will have gathered, rector of the
parish."

"It's extremely good of you, Mr. Venables. If we're really not putting
you out, we will accept your invitation with pleasure. My name is
==> Wimsey--here is my card--and this is my man, Bunter." <==

The Rector fumbled for his glasses, which, after disentangling the cord,
he perched very much askew on his long nose, in order to peer at
Wimsey's card.

will like a wash and brush-up at any rate. We will have supper at 7.30,
if we can get my husband to release you by then, and after that, you
really must go and lie down for a nap. I have put you in here--I see
your man has everything ready for you."

==> "Well, Bunter," said Wimsey, when Mrs. Venables had departed, leaving <==
him to make himself presentable by the inadequate light of a small
oil-lamp and a candle, "that looks a nice bed--but I am not fated to
sleep in it."

"So I understand from the young woman, my lord."

"So I understand from the young woman, my lord."

==> "It's a pity you can't relieve me at the rope, Bunter." <==

"I assure your lordship that for the first time in my existence I regret
that I have made no practical study of campanology."

"I am always so delighted to find that there are things you cannot do.

"Yes, yes, my dear. In a moment. I was only----"

Wimsey saw that the one way to quiet the Rector was to desert him
without compunction. He retired, accordingly, and was captured at the
==> head of the stairs by Bunter, who tucked him firmly up beneath the <==
eiderdown with a hot-water bottle and shut the door upon him.

A roaring fire burned in the grate. Wimsey drew the lamp closer to him,
opened the little brochure presented to him by the Rector, and studied
the title-page:

He was roused by the pealing of bells.

For a moment, memory eluded him--then he flung the eiderdown aside and
==> sat up, ruffled and reproachful, to encounter the calm gaze of Bunter. <==

"Good God! I've been asleep! Why didn't you call me? They've begun
without me."

"Dash it all!" said Wimsey. "This will never do. Must go and hear the
old boy's sermon. Give me a hair-brush. Is it still snowing?"

"Harder than ever, my lord."

==> Wimsey made a hasty toilet and ran downstairs, Bunter following him <==
decorously. They let themselves out by the front door, and, guided by
Bunter's electric torch, made their way through the shrubbery and across
the road to the church, entering just as the organ boomed out its final
notes. Choir and parson were in their places and Wimsey, blinking in the

"Harder than ever, my lord."

Wimsey made a hasty toilet and ran downstairs, Bunter following him
decorously. They let themselves out by the front door, and, guided by

the road to the church, entering just as the organ boomed out its final
notes. Choir and parson were in their places and Wimsey, blinking in the
yellow lamplight, at length discovered his seven fellow-ringers seated
on a row of chairs beneath the tower. He picked his way cautiously over
the cocoa-nut matting towards them, while Bunter, who had apparently

acquired all the necessary information beforehand, made his unperturbed
way to a pew in the north aisle and sat down beside Emily from the
Rectory. Old Hezekiah Lavender greeted Wimsey with a welcoming chuckle
and thrust a prayer-book under his nose as he knelt down to pray.

hand of the agitated Wally and released him for an interval of rest and
refreshment. A soft glugging sound proclaimed that Mr. Donnington's
"usual" was going where it would do most good.

Wimsey, relieved at the end of the third hour, found Mrs. Venables
==> seated among the pewter pots, with Bunter in respectful attendance <==
beside her.

"I do hope," said Mrs. Venables, "that you are not feeling exhausted."

"Far from it; only rather dry." Wimsey remedied this condition without

car turned right along the Thirty-foot Bank, Wimsey noticed that the
wind had changed. It was hauling round to the south, and, though the
snow still lay white and even over the Fen, there was a softness in the
air.

"Yes, my lord."

"Ever seen this part of the country when the floods are out?"

Wimsey drove on in silence for about half a mile. Then he said:

"Motor mechanic possibly, but not recently, I think. Stone-quarrying's
more about the size of it. You can always tell an old lag by his eyes,
==> Bunter. Excellent idea to live down the past, and all that, but I hope <==
our friend doesn't put anything across the good Rector."

little forward each time he is wound, we strike a happy mean. If you
will just remember that he is always _fast_ on Sundays, Mondays and
Tuesdays, _right_ on Wednesdays, and _slow_ on Thursdays, Fridays and
Saturdays, you will find him a very reliable guide."

==> Wimsey said he was sure of it, and turned to find Bunter at his elbow, <==
offering him with one hand his hat and with the other two leather-bound
volumes on a small salver.

"You see, padre, we have every intention of going to Church; we have, in
fact, come prepared. Hymns A & M--I suppose that is the right work?"

"I took the liberty of ascertaining as much beforehand, my lord."

what's the trouble? Have you lost anything?"

"I--er--it's very odd--I could have declared that I laid them down just
here. Agnes! Agnes, my dear! Have you seen those banns anywhere?"

wondering who could have gone to so much expense for the unknown victim.
With a slight shock he read, on a visiting card: "With reverent
sympathy. Lord Peter Wimsey. St. Luke xii. 6."

"Very appropriate," said his lordship, identifying the text after a

a great man."

                 *        *        *        *        *

very dull for him here. I understand he's a great acquisition in the
kitchen and extraordinarily good at music-hall imitations. Twice as good
as the talkies, Cook says."

"Is he indeed?" said Wimsey. "I had no idea of it. But what I don't know
==> about Bunter would fill a book." <==

Mrs. Venables bustled away, but her remarks remained in Wimsey's mind.
He put aside the vest and pants, filled a pipe and wandered down the
garden, pursued by Mrs. Venables with an ancient and rook-proof linen
hat, belonging to the Rector. The hat was considerably too small for

garden, pursued by Mrs. Venables with an ancient and rook-proof linen
hat, belonging to the Rector. The hat was considerably too small for
him, and the fact that he immediately put it on, with expressions of
gratitude, may attest the kind heart which, despite the poet, is
frequently found in close alliance with coronets; though the shock to

wearing this grotesque headgear, and told him to get the car out and
accompany him on a short journey.

to its proper place, and, if you should see Mrs. Venables, give her my
compliments and say that I found its protection invaluable. And, Bunter,
I rely upon you to keep a check upon your Don Juan fascinations and not

pigs and through groups of farmers, who stood carelessly in the middle

thighs. In the centre of one side of the market-place stood the
post-office.

==> "Go in here, Bunter, and ask if there is any letter here for Mr. Stephen <==

Lord Peter waited for some time, as one always waits when transacting
business in rural post-offices, while pigs lurched against his bumpers
and bullocks blew down his neck. Presently, Bunter returned, having

"Well, never mind," said Wimsey. "Leamholt is the post town, so I

grey stones and timber warehouses, and the long lines of her
half-deserted quays.

Here, at the post-office in the little square, Lord Peter waited in the
pleasant hush that falls on country towns where all days but market days

emerged, did so with a trifle less than his usual sedateness, while his
usually colourless face was very slightly flushed about the cheek-bones.

"What luck?" inquired Wimsey, genially.


[line number in individual story] matching line = 5827    window = 5822 5832

usually colourless face was very slightly flushed about the cheek-bones.

"What luck?" inquired Wimsey, genially.

==> To his surprise, Bunter replied by a hasty gesture enjoining silence and <==
caution. Wimsey waited till he had taken his place in the car and
altered his question to:

"What's up?"


[line number in individual story] matching line = 5833    window = 5828 5838

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 97810    window = 97805 97815


caution. Wimsey waited till he had taken his place in the car and
altered his question to:

"What's up?"

==> "Better move on quickly, my lord," said Bunter, "because, while the <==
manœuvre has been attended with a measure of success, it is possible
that I have robbed His Majesty's Mails by obtaining a postal packet
under false pretences."

Long before this handsome period had thundered to its close, the Daimler

under false pretences."

Long before this handsome period had thundered to its close, the Daimler
was running down a quiet street behind the church.

==> "What _have_ you been doing, Bunter?" <==

"Well, my lord, I inquired, as instructed, for a letter addressed to Mr.
Stephen Driver, poste restante, which might have been lying here some
time. When the young person inquired how long a time, I replied,
according to our previous arrangement, that I had intended to visit

were at that moment in the car and might conceivably be supposed to be
the person alluded to, but in the momentary agitation of my spirits, my
lord, I was not in a position to think as quickly or as clearly as I
should have wished."

==> "Bunter," said his lordship, "I warn you that I am growing dangerous. <==
Will you say at once, yes or no, did you get that letter?"

"Yes, my lord, I did. I said, of course, that since the letter for my
chauffeur was there, I would take it to him, adding some facetious
observations to the effect that he must have made a conquest while we

"If I may be allowed to say so, my lord, it is possibly a little
remarkable that the name and address of the sender does not appear on
the back."

==> "That is well observed. Yes, Bunter, you may have full marks for that. <==
The French, as you have no doubt often noticed, seldom head their
letters with an address as we do in England, though they occasionally
write at the foot some such useless indication as 'Paris' or 'Lyon,'
without adding the number of the house and the name of the street. They
do, however, frequently place these necessary indications on the flap of

irrecoverably lost before the letter is answered or even read."

"It has sometimes occurred to me, my lord, to be surprised at that
habit."

==> "Not at all, Bunter. It is quite logical. To begin with, it is a fixed <==
idea with the French that the majority of letters tend to be lost in the
post. They put no faith in Government departments, and I think they are
perfectly right. They hope, however, that, if the post-office fails to
deliver the letter to the addressee it may, in time, return it to the
sender. It seems a forlorn hope, but they are again perfectly right. One

of the missive, all the necessary details for the proper functioning of
this transaction. I do not say he is wrong, though I do think it would
be better if he wrote the address in both places. But the fact that this
particular letter provides no address for return does perhaps suggest
that the sender was not precisely out for publicity. And the devil of it
==> is, Bunter, that ten to one there will be no address on the inside, <==
either. No matter. This is very excellent port. Be good enough to finish
the bottle, Bunter, because it would be a pity to waste it and if I have
any more I shall be too sleepy to drive."

it's not my business, and I'll have to be pushing along."

"Ah!" said the sluice-keeper. "New gates? Ah!"

He remained hanging on the rail and spitting thoughtfully into the water
==> till Wimsey and Bunter had regained the car. Then he came hobbling after <==
them.

"What I says is," he observed, leaning so earnestly over the door of the
Daimler that Wimsey hurriedly drew back his feet, thinking that the
usual expectoration was about to follow, "what I says is, Why don't they

hanging, so I conclude that it is not his--he surely couldn't keep King
Charles' Head out of it so long. Foreign paper--wait a minute! I seem to

"Of this, my lord? I should say that it was written by a person of no

Lefanu and was, if I may be permitted the expression, bats in the

"It had not occurred to me to regard it in that light, my lord. The
style is cramped, certainly, but it is cramped in what I should call a
consistent manner, suggestive of--ah!--literary rather than mechanical
effort."

==> "True, Bunter, true. It certainly isn't anything simple and bucolic of <==
the every-third-word type. And it doesn't look as if it was meant to be
read with a grid, because, with the possible exception of gold,' there
isn't a single word in it that's significant--or could be significant of
anything but moonshine. That bit about the moon is rather good, of its
kind. Mannered, but imaginative. 'Frail and faint as a sickle of straw.'

have been told and it ain't my fault and so I told Mr. Bunter."

Mrs. Venables turned a little pale. Lord Peter presented no

bulldog breed, and had been brought up in the knowledge that a servant
was a servant, and that to be afraid of a servant (one's own or anybody
else's) was the first step to an Avernus of domestic inefficiency. She
turned to Bunter, standing white and awful in the background.

Mrs. Venables put down the chicken-pail.

"But what was it all about?"

stood on the kitchen table.

"That bottle, madam, was entrusted to me yesterday by his lordship. I
placed it in a cupboard in my bedroom, with the intention of
photographing it this morning, before despatching it to Scotland Yard.

'Why, whatever have you got there, Emily? That'll just do,' she says,
'to put the methylated.' So I gives it a dust----"

tone, "and what to say to his lordship I do not know."

"Oh, dear! oh, dear!" said Mrs. Venables, helplessly. Then she seized on
the one point of domestic economy which seemed to call for inquiry. "How
did you come to leave your dusting so late?"

"I am sorry I expressed myself with so much acerbity," he said, "and I

blow which is in store for him. It goes to my heart, if you will pardon
my mentioning the organ in such a connection. There, madam, is his
morning tea, only waiting for my hand to put the boiling water to it,
and I feel, madam, as though it were the hand of a murderer which no

Mary all about it. In a rare taking, she was."

"Indeed!" said the Superintendent, unbelievingly. "So _you_ say. Never
mind. Let's go back to Deacon. You heard that Emily heard something his

Was that it? And what did you think of that?"

"I said to myself, it must be Deacon. I said, here's that devil come out
of his grave to trouble us again, that's what I said. Mind you, I didn't
exactly know, but that's what I said to myself."

"They seem," said Wimsey, "to keep a special brand of disgusting weather
in these parts." He thrust up his hand against the hood of the car,
discharging a deluge of water. "Last time it was snowing and now it's

"Yes, my lord," said that long-suffering man. He was deeply attached to

extraordinary high spring tide. She's just coming up to springs now, so
we has to do a bit of manipulation, like." He turned, and began to wind
down the sluices.

==> "You see the idea, Bunter. If they shut this sluice, all the upland <==
water has to go by the Old Leam, which has enough to do as it is. But if
they leave it open and the tide's strong enough to carry the flood-water
back with it through the sluice, they'll drown all the country above the
sluice."

of the C.I.D., kindly enough. "When did you start growing that
face-fungus? In September? I thought so. What was the idea? You didn't
think it was becoming, did you?"

"I didn't," said Mr. Cranton. "Went to my heart, I may say, to disfigure

His Majesty's bounty. Ah! and look at my hands. They've never got over
it. I ask you, how can a gentleman carry on with his profession after
all those years of unrefined manual labour? Taking the bread out of a
man's mouth, I call it."

==> "So you had some game on, which started last September," said Parker, <==
patiently. "What was it, now? Anything to do with the Wilbraham
emeralds, eh?"

"Well, to be frank, it was," replied Nobby Cranton. "See here, I'll tell
you the truth about that. I didn't mind--I never _have_ minded--being

know--but he had them. And I meant to get them, see? I meant to get
them, and I meant to bring them along and show 'em to you and make you
take back what you said about my having had them. Pretty silly, you'd
have looked, wouldn't you, when you had to own up that I was right?"

==> "Indeed?" said Parker. "That was the idea, was it? You were going to <==
find the stuff and bring it along like a good little boy?"

"That's right."

"No idea of making anything out of them, of course?"

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 99580    window = 99575 99585



"Well, I didn't," agreed Mr. Cranton. "I didn't want to be bothered with
a lot of clumsy cops. It was my own little game, see? All my own work,
as the pavement-artists say."

==> "Delightful," said Parker. "And what made you think you knew where to <==
look for them?"

"Ah!" said Mr. Cranton, cautiously. "Something Deacon once said gave me
an idea. But he was a liar about that, too. I never met such a liar as
that fellow was. He was so crooked, you could have used his spine for a

said I. 'You'll find 'em in Fenchurch,' he said, grinning still more.
'But you aren't likely to see Fenchurch again in a hurry,' he said. So
then I biffed him one--excuse the expression--and the blinking warder
interfered."

==> "Really?" said Parker, incredulously. <==

"Cross my heart and wish I may die," said Mr. Cranton. "But when I got
down to Fenchurch, you see, I found there were no such people--only some
rubbish about bells. So I dismissed the matter from my mind."


[line number in individual story] matching line = 7657    window = 7652 7662

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 99634    window = 99629 99639



"Why the surprise?"

"Why?--Oh, well--somebody wasn't too particular, that's all."

==> "See here," said Parker, "you may as well tell the truth now. Did that <==
woman have anything to do with the thieft of the emeralds?"

"How should I know? But to be frank, I don't believe she did. I think
she was just a plain fool. Deacon's catspaw. I'm sure the fellow put her
on to find out about the stuff, but I don't think she was wise to what

never did suit me--particularly in the blasted middle of winter, with a
thaw going on. I was damn nearly found dead in a ditch, which is no end
for a gentleman."

"You didn't investigate the matter of Batty Thomas and Tailor Paul any
==> further, then?" said Parker, placidly putting aside the eloquence which <==
Mr. Cranton seemed ready to lavish on any side-issue. "I am referring to
the bells. You did not, for instance, visit the belfry, to see if the
emeralds were hidden up there?"

"No, of course I didn't. Besides," went on Mr. Cranton, much too

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 99694    window = 99689 99699



"You never went up into the bell-chamber?"

"Not me."

==> "Then how do you account for that?" demanded Parker, suddenly producing <==
the mysterious cipher and thrusting it under the sick man's eyes.

Mr. Cranton turned extremely white.

"That?" he gasped. "That?--I never----" He fought for breath. "My

"That?" he gasped. "That?--I never----" He fought for breath. "My
heart--here, give me some of the stuff in that glass----"

"Give it him," said Wimsey, "he's really bad."

==> Parker gave him the medicine with a grim face. After a time the blue <==
pallor gave place to a healthier colour, and the breathing became more
natural.

"That's better," said Cranton. "You startled me. What did you say? That?
I never saw that before."

England?"

"I tell you I never heard of him," repeated Cranton, sullenly. "For
God's sake, can't you leave me alone? I tell you I'm ill."

==> He looked ill enough. Parker swore under his breath. <==

"Look here, Nobby, why not come across with the truth? It'll save us
bothering you. I know you're ill. Cough it up and get it over."

"I know nothing about it. I've told you--I went down to Fenchurch and I

"No, it doesn't."

"Are you charging me with anything?"

==> Parker hesitated. "Not as yet," he said. <==

"Then you've got to take my answer," said Mr. Cranton, faintly, but as
one who is sure of his position.

"I know that," said Parker, "but, hang it, man! do you _want_ to be

Parker hesitated. "Not as yet," he said.

"Then you've got to take my answer," said Mr. Cranton, faintly, but as
one who is sure of his position.

==> "I know that," said Parker, "but, hang it, man! do you _want_ to be <==
charged? If you'd rather come down with us to the Yard----"

"What's the idea? What have you got to charge me with? You can try me
for stealing those bloody emeralds all over again. I haven't got them.
Never seen them----"

"He's fainted," said Wimsey.

"He's dead," said Superintendent Blundell, speaking for the first time.

==> "I hope to goodness not," said Parker. "No--it's all right, but he looks <==
pretty queer. Better get hold of that girl. Here, Polly!"

A woman came in. She gave one resentful glance at the three men and
hurried across to Cranton.


[line number in individual story] matching line = 7789    window = 7784 7794

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 99766    window = 99761 99771



"If you've killed him," she muttered, "it's murder. Coming and
threatening one that's as sick as him. You get out, you great bullies.
He's done nobody any harm."

==> "I'll send the doctor along," said Parker. "And I'll be coming to see <==
him again. And when I do come, see that I find him here all right.
Understand? We shall want him elsewhere, you know, as soon as he's fit
to be moved. He hasn't reported himself since last September."

The girl shrugged a disdainful shoulder, and they left her bending over

to be moved. He hasn't reported himself since last September."

The girl shrugged a disdainful shoulder, and they left her bending over
the sick man.

==> "Well, Superintendent," said Parker. "I'm afraid that's the best we can <==
do for you at the moment. The man's not shamming--he's really ill. But
he's holding something out on us. All the same, I don't think it's
murder, somehow. That wouldn't be like Cranton. He knew that paper all
right."

didn't want him. And, if he did for some reason need Legros, and killed
him to get the emeralds, where are the emeralds? If he sold them, you
ought to have found it out by now. If he's still got them, you'd better
have a hunt for them."

==> "We'll search the house," said Parker, dubiously, "but I don't somehow <==
think he's got them. He wasn't alarmed about the emeralds. It's a
puzzle. But we'll turn the place upside-down, and if they're there,
we'll get them."

"And if you do," said Blundell, "then you can arrest that chap for the

you see I was right. What you want to know is, how did I first hear that
Deacon was still on deck? Well, he wrote me a letter, that's how.
Somewhere about last July, that would be. Sent it to the old crib, and
it was forwarded on--never you mind who by."

==> "Gammy Pluck," observed Mr. Parker, distantly. <==

"I name no names," said Mr. Cranton. "Honour among--gentlemen. I burnt
that letter, _being_ an honourable gentleman, but it was some story, and
I don't know that I can do justice to it. Seems that when Deacon made
his get-away, after an unfortunate encounter with a warder, he had to

realised so vividly before why a policeman was called a flattie. Nearly
broke his fingers standing on them. Now I," added Mr. Cranton, "have
rather small feet. Small and well-shod. You can always tell a gentleman
by his feet."

==> "Go on, Nobby," said Mr. Parker. <==

"Anyhow, the third night he was out there lying doggo in a wood
somewhere, he heard a chap coming along that wasn't a flattie. Rolling
drunk, Deacon said he was. So Deacon pops out from behind a tree and
pastes the fellow one. He said he didn't mean to do him in, only put him

tripping over something and a lot of chaps laughing at him. And after
that he must really have fallen asleep. The next thing he knew, he was
in a train again, with Tommies all round him, and from what he could
make out, they were bound for the Front."

==> "That's a very remarkable story," said Mr. Parker. <==

"It's clear enough," said Wimsey. "Some kindly soul must have examined
his papers, found he was due back and shoved him on to the nearest
transport, bound for Dover, I suppose."


[line number in individual story] matching line = 9753    window = 9748 9758

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 101730    window = 101725 101735


about that. His French accent was pretty good, but he pretended to have
lost his speech, so that any mumbling or stammering might be put down to
that, and in the intervals he practised talking to the girl till he was
word-perfect. I must say, Deacon had brains."

==> "We can imagine all that part," said Parker. "Now tell us about the <==
emeralds."

"Oh, yes. The thing that started him on that was getting hold of an old
English newspaper which had a mention of the finding of a body in the
dene-hole--his own body, as everyone thought. It was a 1918 paper, of

was inside again, owing to a regrettable misunderstanding, so I didn't
get the letter for some time, my pals thinking it wasn't quite the sort
of thing to send to the place where I was. See? But when I came out
again, there was the letter waiting for me."

==> "I wonder he made _you_ his confidant," observed Parker. "There had <==
been--shall we say, ungentlemanly words passed on the subject."

"Ah!" said Mr. Cranton. "There had, and I had something to say about
that when I wrote back. But you see, he'd nobody else to go to, had he?
When all's said and done, there's nobody like Nobby Cranton to handle a

could fix him up with money and papers and get him across all right.
Only I told him he'd have to give me a bit more dope on the thing first.
Otherwise, how was I to know he wouldn't double-cross me again, the
dirty skunk?"

==> "Nothing more likely," said Parker. <==

"Ah! and he did, too, blast his worm-eaten little soul! I said he'd have
to tell me where the stuff was. And would you believe it, the hound
wouldn't trust me! Said, if he told me that, I might get in and pinch
the bleeding lot before he got there!"

that."

went on writing backwards and forwards till we reached what they call an
impasse. At last he wrote and said he'd send me a what d'you call--a

that on spec, you understand. I didn't want you people following me
about too much. And besides, I had one or two other irons in the fire.
I'm coming clean, you see."

==> "You'd better," said Parker, ominously. <==

"I didn't get any message on the 30th, nor yet on the 31st, and I
thought I'd been had proper. Only I couldn't see what he had to gain by
double-crossing me. He needed me to handle the goods--or so I thought.
Only then it struck me he might have picked up some other pal over at

"That's what I thought. But I got so windy, I thought I'd better go down
to the place and see what was happening. I didn't want to leave a trail,
so I went over to Walbeach--never mind how, that's off the point----"

==> "Probably Sparky Bones or the Fly-Catcher," put in Parker, thoughtfully. <==

"Ask no questions and you'll hear no lies. My pal decanted me a few
miles out and I footslogged it. I made out I was a tramp labourer,
looking for work on the New Cut. Thank God, they weren't taking on any
hands, so they didn't detain me."

ropes and his head had fallen over--well, it looked as if he'd got what
was coming to him, anyhow, but worse. Because, to do them justice,
they're pretty quick on the drop, but he looked as if it had lasted for
a good long time."

==> "Do you mean the rope was round his neck?" demanded Parker, a little <==
impatiently.

"No. He wasn't hanged. I don't know what killed him. I was just looking
to see, when I heard somebody starting to come up the tower. I didn't
stop, you bet. There was another ladder, and I legged it up that as high

notes seemed to come out of it, high up and clear and close--right in my
ears. You'll think I'm loopy, but I tell you that bell was alive. I shut
my eyes and hung on to the ladder and wished I'd chosen a different kind
of profession--and that'll show you what a state I was in."

==> "You've got too much imagination, Nobby," said Parker. <==

"You wait, Charles," said Lord Peter. "You wait till you get stuck on a
ladder in a belfry in the dark. Bells are like cats and mirrors--they're
always queer, and it doesn't do to think too much about them. Go on,
Cranton."

up in the belfry, it must have come out of my pocket when I pulled the
torch out. I never killed Deacon, but I knew I'd have a job to prove I
didn't, and that's why I spun you a different tale the first time you
came."

==> "Well," said Chief Inspector Parker, "let's hope it'll be a lesson to <==
you to keep out of belfries."

"It will," replied Nobby fervently. "Every time I see a church tower now
it gives me the jim-jams. I'm done with religion, I am, and if I ever go
inside a church-door again, you can take and put me in Broadmoor."

man answering to the description of James Thoday. The bicycle had been
returned on the Sunday by a messenger, who had claimed and taken away
the deposit, minus the charge for hire and insurance. No, not a district
messenger: a youth, who looked like an ordinary out-of-work.

==> On hearing this, Chief Inspector Parker, who was dealing with the London <==
end of the inquiry, groaned dismally. It was too much to expect this
nameless casual to turn up. Ten to one, he had pocketed the surplus
deposit and would be particularly unwilling to inform the world of the
fact.

end of the inquiry, groaned dismally. It was too much to expect this
nameless casual to turn up. Ten to one, he had pocketed the surplus
deposit and would be particularly unwilling to inform the world of the
fact.

==> Parker was wrong. The man who had hired the bicycle had apparently made <==
the fatal mistake of picking an honest messenger. After prolonged
inquiry and advertisement a young Cockney made his appearance at New
Scotland Yard. He gave his name as Frank Jenkins, and explained that he
had only just seen the advertisement. He had been seeking work in
various places, and had drifted back to Town in time to be confronted

in the name of Joseph Smith, at a fictitious address.

The next thing was, obviously, to confront James Thoday with Frank
Jenkins. The messenger identified his employer immediately; James Thoday
persisted, politely, that there was some mistake. What next, thought Mr.
==> Parker. <==

He put the question to Lord Peter, who said:

"I think it's time for a spot of dirty work, Charles. Try putting
William and James alone in a room with a microphone or whatever you call

a long way to go, and I thought we'd be safe enough."

"But, see here, James--if you didn't kill him, who did?"

It was at this point that Superintendent Blundell, Chief Inspector
==> Parker and Lord Peter Wimsey walked in on the pair of them. <==

The only difficulty was that the two witnesses who had formerly refused
to speak could now hardly speak fast enough and spoke both together.
==> Chief Inspector Parker was obliged to call for silence. <==

"All right," he said. "You've both been suspecting each other and
shielding each other. We've grasped that. Now that we've got that clear,
let's have the story. William first." He added the usual caution.

price he wanted and I agreed to pay it. I got the money and gave him the
fifty then and there, promising him the rest when I got Deacon aboard. I
got into the car and started back--and you know what happened
afterwards."

==> "That's very clear," said Parker. "I needn't tell you that you were <==
compounding a serious felony by helping a convicted murderer to escape
from justice. Speaking as a policeman, I am shocked; speaking as a human
being, I have every sympathy for you. Now, you." He turned to Jim. "I
imagine your part of it comes in here."

he'd see him when he went up to put the leathers on the bells. By a big
stroke of luck, he didn't go till after dark, and I suppose he never
looked into that dark corner, or he'd have seen the planks had been
moved."

==> "We know what you did on Saturday," said Parker. "You needn't bother <==
with that."

"No, sir. I had an awful ride with that bike. The acetylene lamp worked
none too well, and it was raining like the tropics. Still, I got
there--much later than I meant, and I went to work. I cut him down----"

"Yes--and lucky for you, my lad, he was a highly respectable and
gentlemanly burglar with the heart of a rabbit and a wholesome fear of
bloodshed--otherwise you might be paying blackmail through the nose. But

consider blackmail beneath him. You got the body down into the
churchyard?"

"Why, when the corpse came up. And--you'll have to forgive _me_,
Jim--but, naturally, I fancied you'd done the job yourself, and--why,
there! I didn't rightly feel the same, neither. Only I kept on hoping,
maybe he'd died natural."

==> "He didn't do that," said Parker, thoughtfully. <==

"Then who killed him?" demanded Jim.

"I'm sure you didn't, for one," replied the detective. "If you had,
you'd have accepted the suggestion that he died of exposure. And somehow
