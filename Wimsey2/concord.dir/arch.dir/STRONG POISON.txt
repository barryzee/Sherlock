one easier, but you must not give too much weight to that consideration.
You are entitled to take it into account, but you must not be too much
prejudiced."

The judge paused for a moment, and Freddy Arbuthnot jerked an elbow into
==> the ribs of Lord Peter Wimsey, who appeared to be a prey to gloom. <==

"I should jolly well hope not. Damn it, if every little game led to
murder, they'd be hanging half of us for doin' in the other half."

"And which half would _you_ be in?" enquired his lordship, fixing him

made could reasonably be construed into a motive for murder. I must
impress upon you that no other motive has been suggested in evidence."

At this point the elderly spinster on the jury was seen to be making a
note--a vigorous note, to judge from the action of her pencil on the
==> paper. Lord Peter Wimsey shook his head slowly two or three times and <==
muttered something under his breath.

"After this," said the judge, "nothing particular seems to have happened
to these two people for three months or so, except that Harriet Vane
left Miss Marriott's house and took a small flat of her own in Doughty

listen to all this tripe about commercial arsenic? Murderers learn it
now at their mother's knee."

"I particularly want you to remember those dates--I will give them to
you again--the 10th. April and the 5th. May." (The Jury wrote them down.
==> Lord Peter Wimsey murmured: "They all wrote down on their slates, 'She <==
doesn't believe there's an atom of meaning in it.'" The Hon. Freddy said
"What? What?" and the judge turned over another page of his notes.)

"About this time, Philip Boyes began to suffer from renewed attacks of a
gastric trouble to which he had been subject from time to time during

"Time is getting on, and as the medical evidence has still to be passed
in review, I will adjourn the Court now for lunch."

"He would," said the Hon. Freddy, "just at the beastliest moment when
==> everybody's appetite is thoroughly taken away. Come on, Wimsey, let's go <==
and fold a chop into the system, shall we?--Hullo!"

Wimsey had pushed past without heeding him, and was making his way down
into the body of the court, where Sir Impey Biggs stood conferring with
his juniors.

his juniors.

"Seems to be in a bit of a stew," said Mr. Arbuthnot, meditatively.
"Gone to put an alternative theory of some kind, I expect. Wonder why I

The Duchess was even more rambling than usual, thought Freddy, and as
she spoke her eyes wandered to her son with a kind of anxiety unusual in
her.

==> "Top-hole to see old Wimsey back, isn't it?" he said, with simple <==
kindliness. "Wonderful how keen he is on this sort of thing, don't you
know. Rampages off the minute he gets home like the jolly old war-horse
sniffing the T.N.T. Regularly up to the eyes in it."

"Well, it's one of Chief-Inspector Parker's cases, and they're such

"Well, it's one of Chief-Inspector Parker's cases, and they're such
great friends, you know, quite like David and Beersheba--or do I mean
Daniel?"

==> Wimsey joined them at this complicated moment, and tucked his mother's <==
arm affectionately in his own.

"Frightfully sorry to keep you waiting, Mater, but I had to say a word
to Biggy. He's having a rotten time, and that old Jeffreys of a judge
looks as though he was getting measured for a black cap. I'm going home

the old Bailey."

"The young woman doesn't seem to have tried that recipe, does she?"
remarked Freddy.

==> "You ought to be on the jury," retorted Wimsey, with unusual acidity, "I <==
bet that's what they're all saying at this moment. I'm convinced that
that foreman is a teetotaller--I saw ginger-beer going into the
jury-room, and I only hope it explodes and blows his inside through the
top of his skull."

that is why I was particular to remind you of all the occasions on which
Philip Boyes took food during the day--the 20th of June, since there is
always the possibility that you may have to take them into
consideration."

==> "A beast, but a just beast," murmured Lord Peter Wimsey. <==

"I have purposely left out of consideration until now another point
which arose out of the analysis, and that is the presence of arsenic in
the hair. The deceased had curly hair, which he wore rather long; the
front portion, when straightened out, measured about six or seven inches

the spot when things happened, and to note down glances, tones of voice,
colour effects and so forth. His copy was always entertaining, and
sometimes even distinguished.

Freddy Arbuthnot, who had not, after all, gone home after lunch, thought
==> it was time to do so now. He fidgeted, and Wimsey frowned at him. The <==
Dowager Duchess made her way along the benches and squeezed in next to
Lord Peter. Sir Impey Biggs, having watched over his client's interests
to the last, disappeared, chatting cheerfully to the Attorney-General,
and followed by the smaller legal fry. The dock was deserted. On the
bench the red roses stood solitary, their petals dropping.

[line number in individual story] matching line = 961    window = 956 966

and followed by the smaller legal fry. The dock was deserted. On the
bench the red roses stood solitary, their petals dropping.

Chief-Inspector Parker, disengaging himself from a group of friends,
came slowly up through the crowd and greeted the Dowager. "And what do

up, eh?"

"Charles," said Wimsey, "you ought not to be allowed out without me.
You've made a mistake, old man."

"You don't really think that."

"I do."

==> Parker looked distressed. He had confidence in Wimsey's judgment, and, <==
in spite of his own interior certainty, he felt shaken.

"My dear man, where's the flaw in it?"

"There isn't one. It's damnably knife-proof. There's nothing wrong about

the Slater person, such a scandal, though now I come to think of it that
was in Scotland where they have such very odd laws about everything
particularly getting married. Well, I suppose we shall soon know now,
not the truth, necessarily, but what the jury have made of it."

==> "Yes; they are being rather longer than I expected. But, I say, Wimsey, <==
I wish you'd tell me--"

"Too late, too late, you cannot enter now. I have locked my heart in a
silver box and pinned it wi' a golden pin. Nobody's opinion matters now,
except the jury's. I expect Miss Climpson is telling 'em all about it.

"Yes--so this is what you call twenty minutes! Three-quarters of an
hour, I make it."

"They've been out an hour-and-a-half," said a girl to her fiancé, just
==> behind Wimsey. "What can they be discussing?" <==

"Perhaps they don't think she did it after all."

"What nonsense! Of course she did it. You could see it by her face.
Hard, that's what I call it, and she never once cried or anything."

"I don't know."

"They've been out three hours and a half now," whispered the girl behind

"Are you, darling? Shall we go?"

"No--I want to hear the verdict. We've waited so long now, we may as
well stop on."

"Yes, quite true. He takes prizes with them."

"What a funny idea!"

==> "Bear up, Freddy," said Lord Peter Wimsey. "I perceive movements. They <==
are coming, my own, my sweet, were it never so airy a tread."

The court rose to its feet. The judge took his seat. The prisoner, very
white in the electricity, reappeared in the dock. The door leading to
the jury-room opened.

[line number in individual story] matching line = 1158    window = 1153 1163

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 38600    window = 38595 38605


The jury stumbled sullenly away. The judge trailed his scarlet robes out
at the back of the bench. The murmur of conversation rose and swelled
into a loud rumble.

"By jove," said Freddy Arbuthnot, "I believe it's your Miss Climpson
==> that's holdin' the jolly old show up, Wimsey. Did you see how the <==
foreman glared at her?"

"Good egg," said Wimsey, "oh, excellent, excellent egg! She has a
fearfully tough conscience--she may stick it out yet."

so much as a lifted eyebrow."

"And he himself has said it," muttered Freddy, "and it's greatly to his
credit. But it's damned hard on people who want their dinners."

this matter to which you have listened with so much patient and zealous
attention. You are discharged, and you are entitled to be excused from
all further jury service for the next twelve years."

Almost before the further formalities were completed, and while the
==> judge's robes still flared in the dark little doorway, Wimsey had <==
scrambled down into the well of the court. He caught the defending
counsel by the gown.

"Biggy--well done! You've got another chance. Let me in on this and
we'll put it off."

[line number in individual story] matching line = 1215    window = 1210 1220

counsel by the gown.

"Biggy--well done! You've got another chance. Let me in on this and
we'll put it off."

==> "You think so, Wimsey? I don't mind confessing that we've done better <==
than I ever expected."

"We'll do better still next time. I say, Biggy, swear me in as a clerk
or something. I want to interview her."


[line number in individual story] matching line = 1229    window = 1224 1234

know it can be done."

"Well, come and see me tomorrow. I must go and speak to her now. I'll be
in my chambers at ten. Good-night."

==> Wimsey darted off and rushed round to the side-door, from which the jury <==
were emerging. Last of them all, her hat askew and her mackintosh
dragged awkwardly round her shoulders, came the elderly spinster. Wimsey
dashed up to her and seized her hand.

"Miss Climpson!"

The following day was a Sunday, but Sir Impey Biggs cancelled an
engagement to play golf (with the less regret as it was pouring cats and
dogs), and held an extraordinary council of war.

==> "Well, now, Wimsey," said the advocate, "what is your idea about this? <==
May I introduce Mr. Crofts of Crofts & Cooper, solicitors for the
defence."

"My idea is that Miss Vane didn't do it," said Wimsey. "I dare say
that's an idea which has already occurred to you, but with the weight of

"Well, now, Wimsey," said the advocate, "what is your idea about this?

==> "My idea is that Miss Vane didn't do it," said Wimsey. "I dare say <==
that's an idea which has already occurred to you, but with the weight of
my great mind behind it, no doubt it strikes the imagination more
forcibly."

Mr. Crofts, not being quite clear whether this was funny or fatuous,

to the good. It can't come on now till the next sessions, which gives us
about a month, and we'll probably get Bancroft next time, who's not such
a severe judge as Crossley. The thing is, can we do anything to improve
the look of our case?"

==> "I'm going to have a strenuous go at it," said Wimsey. "There must _be_ <==
evidence somewhere, you know. I know you've all worked like beavers, but
I'm going to work like a king beaver. And I've got one big advantage
over the rest of you."

"More brains?" suggested Sir Impey, grinning.

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 38798    window = 38793 38803


"More brains?" suggested Sir Impey, grinning.

"No--I should hate to suggest that, Biggy. But I do believe in Miss
Vane's innocence."

==> "Damn it, Wimsey, didn't my eloquent speeches convince you that I was a <==
whole-hearted believer?"

"Of course they did. I nearly shed tears. Here's old Biggy, I said to
myself, going to retire from the Bar and cut his throat if this verdict
goes against him, because he won't believe in British justice any more.

which is running her new book as a serial. They expect a scoop as the
result of all this. But frankly, I don't quite know what they'll say to
the expense of a fresh trial. I'm expecting to hear from them this
morning."

==> "The vultures," said Wimsey. "Well, they'd better carry on, but tell 'em <==
I'll see they're guaranteed. Don't bring my name in, though."

"This is very generous--"

"Not at all. I wouldn't lose the fun of all this for the world. Sort of

"Oh, yes, my lord. You are to be treated on the same footing as the
prisoner's solicitor. Yes, we have had a separate communication from the
police and that will be quite all right, my lord. The warder will take
you down, and explain the regulations to you."

==> Wimsey was conducted through a number of bare corridors to a small room <==
with a glass door. There was a long deal table in it and a couple of
repellent chairs, one at either end of the table.

"Here you are, my lord. You sit at one end and the prisoner at the
other, and you must be careful not to move from your seats, nor to pass

other, and you must be careful not to move from your seats, nor to pass
any object over the table. I shall be outside and see you through the
glass, my lord, but I shan't be able to overhear nothing. If you will
take a seat, they'll bring the prisoner in, my lord."

==> Wimsey sat down and waited, a prey to curious sensations. Presently <==
there was a noise of footsteps, and the prisoner was brought in,
attended by a female wardress. She took the chair opposite to Wimsey,
the wardress withdrew and the door was shut. Wimsey, who had risen,
cleared his throat.

"Please sit down," she said, in the curious, deep voice which had

come from Mr. Crofts."

"Yes," said Wimsey. Her steady gaze was unnerving him. "Yes. I--er--I

he has quite a big professional connection, but Philip really had no
claim on him, as it wasn't family money or anything. His idea was that
great artists deserved to be boarded and lodged at the expense of the
ordinary man."

==> Wimsey was fairly well acquainted with this variety of the artistic <==
temperament. He was struck, however, by the tone of the reply, which was
tinged, he thought, with bitterness and even some contempt. He put his
next question with some hesitation.

"Forgive my asking, but--you were very fond of Philip Boyes?"

"Forgive my asking, but--you were very fond of Philip Boyes?"

"I must have been, mustn't I--under the circumstances?"

==> "Not necessarily," said Wimsey, boldly, "you might have been sorry for <==
him--or bewitched by him--or even badgered to death by him."

"All those things."

Wimsey considered for a moment.

"Were you friends?"

"No." The word broke out with a kind of repressed savagery that startled
him. "Philip wasn't the sort of man to make a friend of a woman. He

thought he was honest when he said he didn't believe in marriage--and
then it turned out that it was a test, to see whether my devotion was
abject enough. Well, it wasn't. I didn't like having matrimony offered
as a bad-conduct prize."

==> "I don't blame you," said Wimsey. <==

"Don't you?"

"No. It sounds to me as if the fellow was a prig--not to say a bit of a
cad. Like that horrid man who pretended to be a landscape-painter and

Philip had made both himself and me ridiculous, and the minute I saw
that--well, the whole thing simply shut down--flop!"

She sketched a gesture of finality.

==> "I quite see that," said Wimsey. "Such a Victorian attitude, too, for a <==
man with advanced ideas. He for God only, she for God in him, and so on.
Well, I'm glad you feel like that about it."

Harriet Vane, who had been smiling at him, frowned, and an indefinable

"Oh, are you another of them? That makes forty-seven."

"And if you can quote _Kai Lung_, we should certainly get on together."

"It seems very probable that I shall not survive to make the

"Don't," said Miss Vane, "please don't alter yourself in any
particular."

that nothing I could do would make me even passable. I'll come in a
different set of garments each time, so as to give you a good all-round
idea of the subject. Bunter--my man, you know--will see to that. He has
excellent taste in ties, and socks, and things like that. Well, I

                               CHAPTER V


==> "Well now," said Wimsey, "why do people kill people?" <==

He was sitting in Miss Katharine Climpson's private office. The
establishment was ostensibly a typing bureau, and indeed there were
three efficient female typists who did very excellent work for authors
and men of science from time to time. Apparently the business was a

[line number in individual story] matching line = 1757    window = 1752 1762

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 39199    window = 39194 39204


magistrate on charges of fraud, blackmail or attempted procuration, but
it is a fact that Miss Climpson's office boasted a private
telephone-line to Scotland Yard, and that few of her ladies were quite
so unprotected as they appeared. It is also a fact that the money which
paid for the rent and upkeep of the premises might, by zealous
==> enquirers, have been traced to Lord Peter Wimsey's banking account. His <==
lordship was somewhat reticent about this venture of his, but
occasionally, when closeted with Chief-Inspector Parker or other
intimate friends, referred to it as "My Cattery."

Miss Climpson poured out a cup of tea before replying. She wore a

"I really don't know," she said, apparently taking the problem as a
psychological one, "it is so _dangerous_, as well as so terribly
_wicked_, one wonders that anybody has the _effrontery_ to undertake it.
And very often they gain so _little_ by it."

==> "That's what I mean," said Wimsey, "what do they set out to gain? Of <==
course, some people seem to do it for the fun of the thing, like that
German female, what's her name, who enjoyed seeing people die."

"Such a _strange_ taste," said Miss Climpson. "No sugar, I think?--You
know, dear Lord Peter, it has been my melancholy duty to attend _many_

greatly cared for George Robey, though Charlie Chaplin always makes me
laugh--still, you know, there are _disagreeable details_ attending _any_
death-bed which one would think could hardly be to anybody's taste,
however depraved."

==> "I quite agree with you," said Wimsey. "But it must be fun, in one <==
sense, to feel that you can control the issues of life and death, don't
you know."

"That is an _infringement_ upon the prerogative of the Creator," said
Miss Climpson.

"There is--passion," said Miss Climpson, with a slight initial
hesitation at the word, "for I should not like to call it _love_, when
it is so unregulated."

==> "That is the explanation put forward by the prosecution," said Wimsey. <==
"I don't accept it."

"Certainly not. But--it might be possible, might it not, that there was
some other unfortunate young woman who was attached to this Mr. Boyes,
and felt vindictively towards him?"

"But there were ten minutes unaccounted for," said Miss Climpson,
shrewdly. "Might he not have entered some public-house for refreshment,
and there met an enemy?"

==> "By jove, that's a possibility." Wimsey made a note, and shook his head <==
dubiously. "But it's rather a coincidence. Unless there was a previous
appointment to meet there. Still, it's worth looking into. At any rate,
it's obvious that Mr. Urquhart's house and Miss Vane's flat were not the
only conceivable places where Boyes might have eaten or drunk between
seven and 10.10 that evening. Very well: under the head 'Passion' we

Query: did he make a will? But surely the defence must have thought of
these things. I am getting depressed again."

"Have a sandwich," said Miss Climpson.

==> "Thank you," said Wimsey, "or some hay. There is nothing like it when <==
you are feeling faint, as the White King truly remarked. Well, that more
or less disposes of the money motive. There remains Blackmail."

Miss Climpson, whose professional connection with the Cattery had taught
her something about blackmail, assented with a sigh.

or less disposes of the money motive. There remains Blackmail."

Miss Climpson, whose professional connection with the Cattery had taught
her something about blackmail, assented with a sigh.

==> "Who was this fellow Boyes?" enquired Wimsey rhetorically. "I know <==
nothing about him. He may have been a blackguard of the deepest dye. He
may have known unmentionable things about all his friends. Why not? Or
he may have been writing a book to show somebody up, so that he had to
be suppressed at all costs. Dash it all, his cousin's a solicitor.
Suppose he has been embezzling Trust deeds or something, and Boyes was

"Of course I will, Lord Peter. You know that it is only _too_ great a
pleasure to do _anything_ for you--even if the whole office were not
your own property, which it _is_. Only let me know, at _any_ minute of
the night or day, and I will do my _very_ best to help you."

==> Wimsey thanked her, made a few enquiries about the work of the bureau <==
and departed. He hailed a taxi and was immediately driven to Scotland
Yard.

cayenne pepper on a red-hot dish!"

"What eloquence!" said Parker, unimpressed. "Anybody would think you'd
gone goopy over the girl."

==> "That's a damned friendly way to talk," said Wimsey, bitterly. "When you <==
went off the deep end about my sister, I may have been unsympathetic--I
daresay I was--but I swear I didn't dance on your tenderest feelings and
call your manly devotion 'going goopy over a girl.' I don't know where
you pick up such expressions, as the clergyman's wife said to the
parrot. 'Goopy,' indeed! I never heard anything so vulgar!"

like. I used to think the 'Yeomen' sentimental tosh, but it is all too
true. Would you like to see me dance in motley?"

"Oh, indeed? And would you like me to trace the 'bus ticket dropped by
Mrs. Brown outside Selfridge's in the last Christmas rush? No use making
it too easy."

==> "A bottle is more likely than a paper," went on Wimsey, ignoring him, <==
"because I think the arsenic must have been taken in liquid form to work
so quickly."

Parker made no further protest, but noted down "Boyes--Doughty
Street--query bottle," and paused expectantly.

thing. But if I spot the criminal, I'll let you arrest him."

"Thanks for small mercies. Well, good luck! Funny for you and me to be
on opposite sides, isn't it?"

"You shouldn't have been out of England. By the way--"

"Yes?"

exhilaration as he purred down to Tweedling Parva. "Mrs. Merdle" the
car, so called because, like that celebrated lady, she was averse to
"row," was sparking merrily on all twelve cylinders, and there was a

Lord Peter found it a little difficult to explain his errand. His name

should like to get it put right if possible."

"Oh--oh, yes!" said Mr. Boyes. He carefully polished a pair of pince-nez
and balanced them on his nose, where they sat crookedly. He peered at

"Poor misguided girl! I assure you, I have no vindictive feelings--that
is to say, nobody would be more happy than myself to know that she was
innocent of this dreadful thing. Indeed, Lord Peter, even if she were
guilty, it would give me great pain to see her suffer the penalty.

of an innocent person. It would haunt me to the end of my days if I
thought there were the least likelihood of it. And I confess that, when
I saw Miss Vane in court, I had grievous doubts whether the police had
done rightly in accusing her."

==> "Thank you," said Wimsey, "it is very kind of you to say that. It makes <==
the job much easier. Excuse me, you say, 'when you saw her in court.'
You hadn't met her previously?"

"No. I knew, of course, that my unhappy son had formed an illicit

generation, and you will perhaps understand that--though he was not bad,
not depraved, I will never think that--yet somehow there was not that
full confidence between us which there should be between father and son.
No doubt I was much to blame. If only his mother had lived--"

==> "My dear sir," mumbled Wimsey, "I perfectly understand. It often <==
happens. In fact, it's continually happening. The post-war generation
and so on. Lots of people go off the rails a bit--no real harm in 'em at
all. Just can't see eye to eye with the older people. It generally wears
off in time. Nobody really to blame. Wild oats and, er, all that sort of
thing."

"I could not approve," said Mr. Boyes, sadly, "of ideas so opposed to

sympathised more--"

themselves. And, when they write books and so on, and get into that set

satisfied, we must use all our endeavours to put it right. How can I
assist?"

hateful question, did your son ever say anything, or write anything to
you which might lead you to think that he--was tired of his life or
anything of that kind? I'm sorry."

suppose. Anything to give pain. Damn the fellow." Aloud he merely said:
"There are other possibilities. Did he, for instance, make a will?"

"He did. Not that he had much to leave, poor boy. His books were very

a number of contradictory possibilities, and he added: "But it would not
amount to an important sum, in any case?"

because he was imperfectly acquainted with the book of Common Prayer, or
possibly because he detected a hint of mockery in the other's tone.
"Well, I have very much enjoyed this chat. I am sorry I can do nothing
for you about First Editions."

==> Wimsey begged him not to mention it, and with a cordial farewell ran <==
hastily down the stairs.

His next visit was to the office of Mr. Challoner, Harriet Vane's agent.
Challoner was an abrupt, dark, militant-looking little man, with untidy
hair and thick spectacles.

"Taking the long view, I am not. Personally, I need not say that I am
extremely grieved, and feel quite positive that there is some mistake."

"From what I know of your lordship, I may say that your interest and
assistance are the best stroke of luck Miss Vane could have had."

Harriet Vane greeted him with a kind of rueful smile.

"Good heavens! I never thought of that. I took it for granted he would
have altered it when we parted. I think he must have, or I should have
heard about it when he died, shouldn't I?"

==> She looked candidly at him, and Wimsey felt a little uncomfortable. <==

"You didn't _know_ he had altered it, then? Before he died, I mean?"

"I never thought a word more about it, as a matter of fact. If I had
thought--of course I should have assumed it. Why?"

at the thingummy bob."

"Meaning the trial? You needn't be so delicate about mentioning it. You
mean, if I had thought I was still his heir, I might have murdered him

rather silly, now I come to think of it."

"Tell me."

==> "Well, you see--" Wimsey choked a little, and then rattled his idea out <==
with an exaggerated lightness.

"Well--it's about a girl (or a man would do, but we'll call it a girl)
who writes novels--crime stories, in fact. And she has a--a friend who
also writes. Neither of them best-sellers, you see, but just ordinary

"Then _her_ books would become best-sellers, too."

"How true that is! But possibly she wouldn't live to enjoy the profits."

==> "That, of course," said Wimsey, "is the snag." <==

"Because, unless she were suspected and arrested and tried, the scoop
would only half come off."

were very wicked, manage to push the blame on somebody else. Or lead
people to suppose that her friend had made away with himself."

"I can't say, off-hand. I'll give it careful thought and let you know.
Or--here's an idea!"

"Yes?"

wishes to benefit--somebody, say a father, mother, sister, lover or
cause, that badly needs money. She makes a will in his, her or its
favour, and lets herself be hanged for the crime; knowing that the
beloved object will then come in for the money. How's that?"

==> "Great!" cried Wimsey, carried away, "Only--wait a minute. They wouldn't <==
give her the friend's money, would they? You're not allowed to profit by
a crime."

"Oh, hang! That's true. It would only be her own money, then. She could
make that over by a deed of gift. Yes--look! If she did that immediately

stop it!"

She faced him with dancing eyes.

But, I say, it's a good plot, isn't it?"

"It's a winner! Shall we write it?"

"But what you've done so far is to provide me with a very convincing
motive for murder. I don't know that that's going to help us a great
lot."

motive, anyway."

"Why?"

that he is the beloved object."

"No?" said Miss Vane, "and why not? Don't you know that I passionately
dote on every chin on his face?"

though it will be rather hard work. Anyway, keep smiling--it suits you."

forrarder. How about this fellow Urquhart? He looked all right in Court,
but you never can tell. I think I'd better pop round and see him."

He presented himself accordingly in Woburn Square, but was disappointed.
Mr. Urquhart had been called away to a sick relative. It was not Hannah
==> Westlock who answered the door, but a stout elderly woman, whom Wimsey <==
supposed to be the cook. He would have liked to question her, but felt
that Mr. Urquhart would hardly receive him well if he discovered that
his servants had been pumped behind his back. He therefore contented
himself with enquiring how long Mr. Urquhart was likely to be away.

"I couldn't rightly say, sir. I understand it depends how the sick lady
gets on. If she gets over it, he'll be back at once, for I know he is
very busy just now. If she should pass away, he would be engaged some
time, with settling up the estate."

==> "I see," said Wimsey, "It's a bit awkward, because I wanted to speak to <==
him rather urgently. You couldn't give me his address, by any chance?"

"Well, sir, I don't rightly know if Mr. Urquhart would wish it. If it's
a matter of business, sir, they could give you information at his office
in Bedford Row."

==> "Thanks very much," said Wimsey, noting down the number. "I'll call <==
there. Possibly they'd be able to do what I want without bothering him."

"Yes, sir. Who should I say called?"

Wimsey handed over his card, writing at the top, "In re R. v. Vane," and

added:

"But there is a chance he may be back quite soon?"

"Oh, yes, sir. Last time he wasn't away more than a couple of days, and

"Oh, yes, sir. Last time he wasn't away more than a couple of days, and
a merciful providence I am sure that was, with poor Mr. Boyes dying in
that dreadful manner."

==> "Yes, indeed," said Wimsey, delighted to find the subject introducing <==
itself of its own accord. "That must have been a shocking upset for you
all."

"Well there," said the cook, "I don't hardly like to think of it, even
now. A gentleman dying in the house like that, and poisoned too, when

"Well there," said the cook, "I don't hardly like to think of it, even
now. A gentleman dying in the house like that, and poisoned too, when
one's had the cooking of his dinner--it do seem to bring it home to one,
like."

==> "It wasn't the dinner that was at fault, anyway," said Wimsey, genially. <==

"Oh, dear, no, sir--we proved that most careful. Not that any accident
could happen in my kitchen--I should like to see it! But people do say
such things if they get half a chance. Still, there wasn't a thing ate
but master and Hannah and I had some of it, and very thankful I was for

==> "You must be; I am sure." Wimsey was framing a further enquiry, when the <==
violent ringing of the area bell interrupted them.

"There's that butcher," said the cook, "you'll excuse me, sir. The
parlour-maid's in bed with the influenza, and I'm single-handed this
morning. I'll tell Mr. Urquhart you called."

received by an elderly clerk, who made no difficulty about supplying Mr.
Urquhart's address.

"Here it is, my lord. Care of Mrs. Wrayburn, Applefold, Windle,
Westmorland. But I shouldn't think he would be very long away. In the

But juries are very unreliable, especially nowadays, with women on them.
We see a good deal of the fair sex in this profession," said the clerk,
with a sly smile, "and very few of them are remarkable for possessing
the legal mind."

==> "How true that is," said Wimsey. "If it wasn't for them, though, there'd <==
be much less litigation, so it's all good for business."

"Ha, ha! Very good, my lord. Well, we have to take things as they come,
but in my opinion--I'm an old-fashioned man--the ladies were most
adorable when they adorned and inspired and did not take an active part

can't get temporary assistance very well. Some of the work is
confidential, of course, and in any case, an atmosphere of permanence is
desirable."

==> Wimsey sympathised with the head-clerk's grievance, and bade him an <==
affable good-morning. There is a telephone box in Bedford Row, and he
darted into it and immediately rang up Miss Climpson.

"Lord Peter Wimsey speaking--oh, hullo, Miss Climpson! How is

a little peevishly.

"I wished to ask you, my lord, whether your lordship thought of making
any changes in your establishment?"

undying attachment to the loved routine of coffee, bath, razor, socks,

"I can't see anything," he said to himself. "No lily on my cheek with
anguish moist and fever-dew. I suppose, though, it's hopeless to try and

enlist the help of Miss Marjorie Phelps. She made figurines in porcelain
for a living, and was therefore usually to be found either in her studio
or in some one else's studio. A telephone-call at 10 a.m. would probably

in a lantern of painted glass, and it was packed to suffocation with

elements in this compound atmosphere, and identified rightly, as
kippers. At the piano, which stood just inside the door, a young man

to a violin obligato by an extremely loose-jointed person of

with bushy red hair was playing something of a Czecho-Slovakian flavour,
to a violin obligato by an extremely loose-jointed person of
indeterminate sex in a Fair-Isle jumper. Nobody looked round at their
entrance. Marjorie picked her way over the scattered limbs on the floor
and, selecting a lean young woman in red, bawled into her ear. The young
==> woman nodded and beckoned to Wimsey. He negotiated a passage and was <==
introduced to the lean woman by the simple formula: "Here's Peter--this
is Nina Kropotky."

"So pleased," shouted Madame Kropotky through the clamour. "Sit by me.
Vanya will get you something to drink. It is beautiful, yes? That is

Vanya will get you something to drink. It is beautiful, yes? That is
Stanislas--such a genius his new work on the Piccadilly Tube
Station--great, n'est-ce-pas? Five days he was continually travelling
upon the escalator to absorb the tone-values."

==> "Colossal!" yelled Wimsey. <==

"So--you think? Ah! You can appreciate! You understand it is really for
the big orchestra. On the piano it is nothing. It needs the brass, the
effects, the timpani-b'rrrrrrr! So! But one seizes the form, the
outline! Ah! it finishes! Superb! Magnificent!"

haggardly round. The violinist put down its instrument and stood up,
revealing itself, by its legs, to be female. The room exploded into
conversation. Madame Kropotky leapt over her seated guests and embraced
the perspiring Stanislas on both cheeks. The frying-pan was lifted from
the stove in a fusillade of spitting fat, a shriek went up for 'Vanya'
==> and presently a cadaverous face was pushed down to Wimsey's, and a deep <==
guttural voice barked at him: "What will you drink?" while
simultaneously a plate of kippers came hovering perilously over his
shoulder.

"Thanks," said Wimsey, "I have just dined--just _dined_," he roared

despairingly, "full up, complet!"

Marjorie came to the rescue with a shriller voice and more determined
refusal.

"Tea!" echoed the cadaverous man, "they want tea! What do you think of
Stanislas' tone-poem? Strong, modern, eh? The soul of rebellion in the
crowd--the clash, the revolt at the heart of the machinery. It gives the
bourgeois something to think of, oh, yes!"

==> "Bah!" said a voice in Wimsey's ear, as the cadaverous man turned away, <==
"it is nothing. Bourgeois music. Programme music. Pretty!--You should
hear Vrilovitch's 'Ecstasy on the letter Z.' That is pure vibration with
no antiquated pattern in it. Stanislas--he thinks much of himself, but
it is old as the hills--you can sense the resolution at the back of all
his discords. Mere harmony in camouflage. Nothing in it. But he takes

it is old as the hills--you can sense the resolution at the back of all
his discords. Mere harmony in camouflage. Nothing in it. But he takes
them all in because he has red hair and reveals his bony structure."

The speaker certainly did not err along these lines, for he was as bald
==> and round as a billiard-ball. Wimsey replied soothingly: <==

"Well, what can you do with the wretched and antiquated instruments of
our orchestra? A diatonic scale, bah! Thirteen miserable, bourgeois
semi-tones, pooh! To express the infinite complexity of modern emotion,
you need a scale of thirty-two notes to the octave."

"But why cling to the octave?" said the fat man. "Till you can cast away
the octave and its sentimental associations, you walk in fetters of
convention."

==> "That's the spirit!" said Wimsey. "I would dispense with all definite <==
notes. After all, the cat does not need them for his midnight melodies,
powerful and expressive as they are. The love-hunger of the stallion
takes no account of octave or interval in giving forth the cry of
passion. It is only man, trammelled by a stultifying convention--Oh,
hullo, Marjorie, sorry--what is it?"

"Some of them. But I think I'm getting light-headed."

"You'll feel worse in an hour or so. So you'd better come now." She
steered him to a remote spot near the gas-oven, where an extremely
elongated man was sitting curled up on a floor cushion, eating caviare
==> out of a jar with a pickle-fork. He greeted Wimsey with a sort of <==
lugubrious enthusiasm.

"Hell of a place," he said, "hell of a business altogether. This stove's
too hot. Have a drink. What the devil else can one do? I come here,
because Philip used to come here. Habit, you know. I hate it, but

there's nowhere else to go."

==> "You knew him very well, of course," said Wimsey, seating himself in a <==
waste-paper basket, and wishing he was wearing a bathing-suit.

"I was his only real friend," said Ryland Vaughan, mournfully. "All the
rest only cared to pick his brains. Apes! parrots! all the bloody lot of
them."

sincerity. "But he seemed to me an unhappy soul."

"Nobody understood him," said Vaughan. "They called him difficult--who
wouldn't be difficult with so much to fight against? They sucked the
blood out of him, and his damned thieves of publishers took every

difference between her mind and his? Of course it was hopeless from the
start for Philip to get entangled with that kind of woman. Genius must
be served, not argued with. I warned him at the time, but he was
infatuated. And then, to want to marry her--"

==> "Why did he?" asked Wimsey. <==

"Remains of parsonical upbringing, I suppose. It was really pitiful.
Besides, I think that fellow Urquhart did a lot of mischief. Sleek
family lawyer--d'you know him?"

cousin and the father in the background--oh, well! It's no use crying
about it now. His work is left, and that's the best part of him. He's
left me that to look after, at least. Harriet Vane didn't get her finger
in that pie, after all."

==> "I'm sure it's absolutely safe in your hands," said Wimsey. <==

"But when one thinks what there might have been," said Vaughan, turning
his blood-shot eyes miserably on Lord Peter, "it's enough to make one
cut one's throat, isn't it?"

went to his cousin's. You don't think he had anything on him in the way
of--poison or anything? I don't want to seem unkind--but he was
unhappy--it would be rotten to think that he--"

told me--he trusted me in those last days. I shared all his thoughts. He
was miserably hurt by that damned woman, but he wouldn't have gone
without telling me or saying good-bye. And besides--he wouldn't have
chosen that way. Why should he? I could have given him--"

==> He checked himself, and glanced at Wimsey, but, seeing nothing in his <==
face beyond sympathetic attention, went on:

"I remember talking to him about drugs. Hyoscine--veronal--all that sort
of thing. He said, 'If ever I want to go out, Ryland, you'll show me the
way.' And I would have--if he'd really wanted it. But arsenic! Philip,

way.' And I would have--if he'd really wanted it. But arsenic! Philip,
who loved beauty so much--do you think he would have chosen
arsenic?--the suburban poisoner's outfit? That's absolutely impossible."

==> "It's not an agreeable sort of thing to take, certainly," said Wimsey. <==

"Look here," said Vaughan, hoarsely and impressively--he had been
putting a constant succession of brandies on top of the caviare, and was
beginning to lose his reserve--"Look here! See this!" He pulled a small
bottle from his breast-pocket. "That's waiting, till I've finished

the souls thronging thick as leaves in Vallombrosa--no, that's
Milton--'amorioris ultore--ultoriore--damn it--poor Phil!"

Here Mr. Vaughan burst into tears and patted the little bottle.

==> Wimsey, whose head and ears were thumping as though he were sitting in <==
an engine-room, got up softly and withdrew. Somebody had begun a
Hungarian song and the stove was white-hot. He made signals of distress
to Marjorie, who was sitting in a corner with a group of men. One of
them appeared to be reading his own poems with his mouth nearly in her
ear, and another was sketching something on the back of an envelope, to

when I'm feeling better and there is more room for my feelings to
expand. Good-night, Nina--we've enjoyed it frightfully and, Boris, that
poem's the best thing you've done, only I couldn't hear it properly.
Peter, tell them what a rotten mood I'm in tonight and take me home."

==> "That's right," said Wimsey, "nervy, you know--bad effect on the manners <==
and so on."

"Manners," said a bearded gentleman suddenly and loudly, "are for the
bourgeois."

and so on."

"Manners," said a bearded gentleman suddenly and loudly, "are for the
bourgeois."

in the what-not. Come on, Marjorie, or we shall all be getting polite."

"I begin again," said the singer, "from the beginning."

"Whew!" said Wimsey, on the staircase.

Joey Trimbles occupied a studio over a mews. Here there was the same
crowd, the same smoke, more kippers, still more drinks and still more
heat and conversation. In addition there was a blaze of electric light,
a gramophone, five dogs and a strong smell of oil-paints. Sylvia
==> Marriott was expected. Wimsey found himself involved in a discussion of <==
free love, D. H. Lawrence, the prurience of prudery and the immoral
significance of long skirts. In time, however, he was rescued by the
arrival of a masculine-looking middle-aged woman with a sinister smile
and a pack of cards, who proceeded to tell everybody's fortune. The
company gathered around her, and at the same time a girl came in and

and can't escape us, I sometimes wish they'd all sprain their ankles.
And yet, you know, nearly all those people are doing very good work.
Even the Kropotky crowd. I used to enjoy this kind of thing myself,
once."

==> "We're getting old, you and I," said Wimsey. "Sorry, that's rude. But do <==
you know, I'm getting on for forty, Marjorie."

"You wear well. But you are looking a bit fagged tonight, Peter dear.
What's the matter?"

"Oh, I've been settled for years."

"With Bunter and the books. I envy you sometimes, Peter."

==> Wimsey said nothing. Marjorie looked at him almost in alarm, and tucked <==
her arm in his.

"Peter--do please be happy. I mean, you've always been the comfortable
sort of person that nothing could touch. Don't alter, will you?"

her arm in his.

"Peter--do please be happy. I mean, you've always been the comfortable
sort of person that nothing could touch. Don't alter, will you?"

==> That was the second time Wimsey had been asked not to alter himself; the <==
first time, the request had exalted him; this time, it terrified him. As
the taxi lurched along the rainy Embankment, he felt for the first time
the dull and angry helplessness which is the first warning stroke of the
triumph of mutability. Like the poisoned Athulf in the _Fool's Tragedy_,
he could have cried, "Oh, I am changing, changing, fearfully changing."

you come for the body or anything?"

"Lord Peter's looking into Harriet Vane's business for her."

She stumped over to a cupboard, and Sylvia said:

have you found any clues or anything?"

hope something may come up the other end."

"Have you seen the cousin yet--the Urquhart creature?"

"Got an appointment with him for tomorrow. Why?"

"And whatever Eiluned thinks, I can't believe Phil Boyes did it
himself."

"He talked such a lot," said Sylvia. "And he really had too high an

world of the privilege of reading his books."

"No. The murder spoilt it a bit--if it was a murder, which I don't
believe. Philip Boyes was always determined to be a victim, and it was
very irritating of him to succeed in the end. I believe that's what he
did it for."

==> "People do do that kind of thing," said Wimsey, thoughtfully. "But it's <==
difficult to prove. I mean, a jury is much more inclined to believe in
some tangible sort of reason, like money. But I can't find any money in
this case."

Eiluned laughed.

wanted their hands held. All the same, the women are just as bad, or
they wouldn't put up with it. Thank Heaven, I've never borrowed and

central figures in the problem--what journalists like to call the
protagonists." His mouth gave a wry little twist. "One gets a lot of
illumination in that fierce light that beats upon a scaffold."

"Don't say that," pleaded Sylvia.

A telephone rang somewhere outside, and Eiluned Price went out to answer
it.

Mr. Bleeding Chief-Inspector Parker."

"I hope you will," said Parker, amiably, and rang off.

"Miss Price's price has gone to odds on," he announced. "It's suicide,
fifty to one and no takers. I am going to grin like a dog and run about
the city."

"Go on," said Mrs. Bulfinch, "you're a one, aren't you? Don't you pay no
attention to him, your lordship. You know what these police fellows
are."

testimonials, I can trust my own eyes and ears, Mrs. Bulfinch, and I can
only say that, if I had had the happiness to make your acquaintance
before it was too late, it would have been my life-time's ambition to
wipe Mr. Bulfinch's eye."

stop it.' And he takes out a white paper packet with some powder in it,
and drops it into the glass of water and stirs it up with a fountain-pen
and drinks it off."

"No; it was just a plain powder, and it took a bit of a time to mix. He

something of that sort. And then he says, 'Thanks very much. I'm better
now and I'd better get home in case it takes me again.' And he raised

"Oh, a good dollop. He didn't measure it or anything, just shot it in
out of the packet. Near a dessert spoonful it might have been."

"And what happened to the packet?" prompted Parker.

==> "Ah, there you are." Mrs. Bulfinch took a glance at Wimsey's face and <==
seemed pleased with the effect she was producing.

"We'd just got the last customer out--about five past eleven, that would
be, and George was locking the door, when I see something white on the
seat. Somebody's handkerchief I thought it was, but when I picked it up,

because I looked to see what it was."

"You didn't try tasting it, I suppose?"

"Not me. It might have been poison or something. I tell you, he was a
==> funny-looking customer." (Parker and Wimsey exchanged glances.) <==

"Was that what you thought at the time?" enquired Wimsey, "or did it
only occur to you later on--after you'd read about the case, you know?"

"I thought it at the time, of course," retorted Mrs. Bulfinch,

"I thought it at the time, of course," retorted Mrs. Bulfinch,
snappishly. "Aren't I telling you that's why I didn't taste it? I said
so to George at the time, what's more. Besides, if it wasn't poison, it

give evidence at that."

"You know where to find me," said Mrs. Bulfinch, with spirit. "I shan't
run away."

==> "We're very much obliged to you for coming now," added Wimsey, <==
pleasantly.

"Don't mention it," said the lady. "Is that all you want, Mr.
Chief-Inspector?"

"I never was one for talking," said Mrs. Bulfinch, offended. "And it's
my opinion, when it comes to putting two-and-two together to make five
of 'em, the ladies aren't in it with the gentlemen."

"I may pass this on to the solicitors for the defence, I suppose?" said
==> Wimsey, when the witness had departed. <==

"Of course," said Parker, "that's why I asked you to come and hear
it--for what it's worth. Meanwhile, we shall of course have a good hunt
for the packet."

"Of course," said Parker, "that's why I asked you to come and hear

that--naturally."

Mr. Crofts did not look best pleased when this story was handed on to

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 41533    window = 41528 41538


"I warned you, Lord Peter," he said, "what might come of showing our
hand to the police. Now they've got hold of this incident, they will
have every opportunity to turn it to their own advantage. Why didn't you
leave it to us to make the investigation?"

==> "Damn it," said Wimsey angrily, "it was left to you for about three <==
months and you did absolutely nothing. The police dug it up in three
days. Time's important in this case, you know."

"Very likely, but don't you see that the police won't rest now till
they've found this precious packet?"

"And supposing they find it and it _is_ arsenic?"

"In _that_ case, of course," said Mr. Crofts, "we shall get an
acquittal. But do you believe in that possibility, my lord?"

==> "It's perfectly evident that _you_ don't," said Wimsey, hotly. "In fact, <==
you think your client's guilty. Well, I don't."

Mr. Crofts shrugged his shoulders.

"In our client's interests," he said, "we are bound to look at the

[line number in individual story] matching line = 4123    window = 4118 4128

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 41565    window = 41560 41570


"In our client's interests," he said, "we are bound to look at the
unfavourable side of all evidence, so as to anticipate the points that
are likely to be made by the prosecution. I repeat, my lord, that you
have acted indiscreetly."

==> "Look here," said Wimsey, "I'm not out for a verdict of 'Not Proven.' As <==
far as Miss Vane's honour and happiness are concerned, she might as well
be found guilty as acquitted on a mere element of doubt. I want to see
her absolutely cleared and the blame fixed in the right quarter. I don't
want any shadow of doubt about it."

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 41575    window = 41570 41580



"Highly desirable, my lord," agreed the solicitor, "but you will allow
me to remind you that it is not merely a question of honour or
happiness, but of saving Miss Vane's neck from the gallows."

==> "And I say," said Wimsey, "that it would be better for her to be hanged <==
outright than to live and have everybody think her a murderess who got
off by a fluke."

"Indeed?" said Mr. Crofts, "I fear that is not an attitude that the
defence can very well adopt. May I ask if it is adopted by Miss Vane

"Indeed?" said Mr. Crofts, "I fear that is not an attitude that the
defence can very well adopt. May I ask if it is adopted by Miss Vane
herself?"

==> "I shouldn't be surprised if it was," said Wimsey. "But she's innocent, <==
and I'll make you damn well believe it before I've done."

"Excellent, excellent," said Mr. Crofts, suavely, "nobody will be more
delighted than myself. But I repeat that, in my humble opinion, your
lordship will be wiser not to betray too many confidences to

Chief-Inspector Parker."

==> Wimsey was still simmering inwardly from this encounter when he entered <==
Mr. Urquhart's office in Bedford Row. The head-clerk remembered him and
greeted him with the deference due to an exalted and expected visitor.
He begged his lordship to take a seat for a moment, and vanished into an
inner office.


[line number in individual story] matching line = 4159    window = 4154 4164

He begged his lordship to take a seat for a moment, and vanished into an
inner office.

A woman typist, with a strong, ugly, rather masculine face, looked up
from her machine as the door closed, and nodded abruptly to Lord Peter.
==> Wimsey recognized her as one of the "Cattery," and put a commendatory <==
mental note against Miss Climpson's name for quick and efficient
organisation. No words passed, however, and in a few moments the
head-clerk returned and begged Lord Peter to step inside.

Norman Urquhart rose from his desk and held out a friendly hand of

[line number in individual story] matching line = 4165    window = 4160 4170

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 41607    window = 41602 41612


mental note against Miss Climpson's name for quick and efficient
organisation. No words passed, however, and in a few moments the
head-clerk returned and begged Lord Peter to step inside.

Norman Urquhart rose from his desk and held out a friendly hand of
==> greeting. Wimsey had seen him at the trial, and noted his neat dress, <==
thick, smooth dark hair and general appearance of brisk and
business-like respectability. Seeing him now more closely, he noticed
that he was rather older than he had appeared at a distance. He put him
down as being somewhere about the middle forties. His skin was pale and
curiously clear, except for a number of little freckles, like sun-spots,

[line number in individual story] matching line = 4179    window = 4174 4184

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 41621    window = 41616 41626


orbits, as though anxiety were not unknown to them.

The solicitor welcomed his guest in a high, pleasant voice and asked
what he could do for him.

==> Wimsey explained that he was interested in the Vane poisoning trial, and <==
that he had the authority of Messrs. Crofts & Cooper to come and bother
Mr. Urquhart with questions, adding, as usual, that he was afraid he was
being a nuisance.

"Not at all, Lord Peter, not at all. I'm only too delighted to help you

[line number in individual story] matching line = 4190    window = 4185 4195

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 41632    window = 41627 41637


in any way, though really I'm afraid you have heard all I know.
Naturally, I was very much taken aback by the result of the autopsy, and
rather relieved, I must admit, to find that no suspicion was likely to
be thrown on me, under the rather peculiar circumstances."

==> "Frightfully tryin' for you," agreed Wimsey. "But you seem to have taken <==
the most admirable precautions at the time."

"Well, you know, I suppose we lawyers get into a habit of taking
precautions. Not that I had any idea of poison at the time--or, needless
to say, I should have insisted on an enquiry then and there. What was in

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 41647    window = 41642 41652


worse in one way. I suppose, really, in all cases of sudden and
unaccountable illness, an analysis of the secretions ought to be made as
a routine part of the business, but Dr. Weare appeared perfectly
satisfied, and I trusted entirely to his judgment."

==> "Obviously," said Wimsey. "One doesn't naturally jump to the idea that <==
people are bein' murdered--though I dare say it happens more often than
one is apt to suppose."

"It probably does, and if I'd ever had the handling of a criminal case,
the suspicion might have occurred to me, but my work is almost entirely

"It probably does, and if I'd ever had the handling of a criminal case,
the suspicion might have occurred to me, but my work is almost entirely
conveyancing and that sort of business--and probate and divorce and so
on."

==> "Talkin' of probate," said Wimsey, carelessly, "had Mr. Boyes any sort <==
of financial expectations?"

"None at all that I know of. His father is by no means well off--the
usual country parson with a small stipend and a huge Vicarage and
tumble-down Church. In fact, the whole family belongs to the unfortunate

me a cruel thing that one may not put these poor old people out of the
way, as one would a favourite animal--but the law will not let us be so
merciful."

"Yes, we'd be hauled over the coals by the N.S.P.C.A. if we let a cat
==> linger on in misery," said Wimsey. "Silly, isn't it? But it's all of a <==
piece with the people who write to the papers about keepin' dogs in
draughty kennels and don't give a hoot--or a penny--to stop landlords
allowin' a family of thirteen to sleep in an undrained cellar with no
glass in the windows and no windows to put it in. It really makes me
quite cross, sometimes, though I'm a peaceful sort of idiot as a rule.

these ancient ladies."

"I suppose you're about her only living relation now."

"I suppose I am, except for an uncle of mine in Australia." Mr. Urquhart
==> accepted the fact of the relationship without enquiring how Wimsey came <==
to know about it. "Not that my being there can do her any good. But I'm
her man of business, too, so it's just as well I should be on the spot
when anything happens."

"Oh, quite, quite. And being her man of business, of course you know how

she has left her money."

"Well, yes, of course. Though I don't quite see, if you'll forgive my
saying so, what that has to do with the present problem."

==> "Why, don't you see," said Wimsey, "it just occurred to me that Philip <==
Boyes might have got himself into some kind of financial mess-up--it
happens to the best of men--and have, well, taken the short way out of
it. But, if he had any expectations from Mrs. Wrayburn, and the old
girl, I mean, the poor old lady, was so near shuffling off this mortal
thingummy, why, then, don't you know, he would have waited, or raised

anything? I beg your pardon, fearfully inquisitive and all that, but I
mean to say, considering you've been looking after her for years and are
her only available relation so to speak, it would be a trifle thick,
what?"

==> The solicitor frowned, and Wimsey apologised. <==

"I know, I know--I've been fearfully impudent. It's a failing of mine.
And anyhow, it'll all be in the papers when the old lady does pop off,
so I don't know why I should be so anxious to pump you. Wash it out--I'm
sorry."

"There's no real reason why you shouldn't know," said Mr. Urquhart,
slowly, "though one's professional instinct is to avoid disclosing one's
clients' affairs. As a matter of fact, I am the legatee myself."

==> "Oh?" said Wimsey, in a disappointed voice. "But in that case--that <==
rather weakens the story, doesn't it? I mean to say, your cousin might
very well have felt, in that case, that he could look to you for--that
is--of course I don't know what your ideas might have been--"

Mr. Urquhart shook his head.

should like you to see exactly why I was forced to take up this rather
uncompromising attitude towards my cousin. Ah, thank you, Miss
Murchison."

He opened the deed-box with a key attached to a bunch which he took from
==> his trousers' pocket, and turned over a quantity of papers. Wimsey <==
watched him with the expression of a rather foolish terrier who expects
a tit-bit.

"Dear, dear," ejaculated the solicitor, "it doesn't seem to be--oh! of
course, how forgetful of me. I'm so sorry, it's in my safe at home. I

got it out for reference last June, when the previous alarm occurred
about Mrs. Wrayburn's illness, and in the confusion which followed on my
cousin's death I quite forgot to bring it back. However, the gist of it
was--"

==> "Never mind," said Wimsey, "there's no hurry. If I called at your house <==
tomorrow, perhaps I could see it then."

"By all means, if you think it important. I do apologise for my
carelessness. In the meantime, is there anything else I can tell you
about the matter?"

"By all means, if you think it important. I do apologise for my
carelessness. In the meantime, is there anything else I can tell you
about the matter?"

==> Wimsey asked a few questions, covering the ground already traversed by <==
Bunter in his investigations, and took his departure. Miss Murchison was
again at work in the outer office. She did not look up as he passed.

"Curious," mused Wimsey, as he pattered along Bedford Row, "everybody is

                               CHAPTER XI


==> Wimsey presented himself at Mr. Urquhart's house at 9 o'clock the next <==
morning, and found that gentleman at breakfast.

"I thought I might catch you before you went down to the office," said
his lordship, apologetically. "Thanks awfully, I've had my morning
nosebag. No, really, thanks--I never drink before eleven. Bad for the

can cast your eye over it while I drink my coffee, if you'll excuse my
going on. It exposes the family skeleton a little, but it's all ancient
history now."

He fetched a sheet of typescript from a side-table and handed it to
==> Wimsey, who noticed, mechanically, that it had been typed on a Woodstock <==
machine, with a chipped lower case p, and an A slightly out of
alignment.

"I'd better make quite clear the family connection of the Boyes' and the
Urquharts'," he went on, returning to the breakfast-table, "so that you

persecution, as, indeed, neither had Arthur Boyes, but the old sore
rankled still, and she wouldn't hear a word in his favour. So I drew up
the will as she wanted it; if I hadn't, somebody else would have done
so, you know."

==> Wimsey nodded, and gave his attention to the will, which was dated eight <==
years previously. It appointed Norman Urquhart as sole executor, and,
after a few legacies to servants and to theatrical charities, it ran as
follows:--

"All the rest of my property whatsoever and wheresoever situated I give

give, lend or convey to the said Philip Boyes any part of the income
derived from the said property enjoyed by him the said Norman Urquhart
during his lifetime nor employ the same to assist the said Philip Boyes
in any manner whatsoever."

==> "H'm!" said Wimsey, "that's pretty clear, and pretty vindictive." <==

"Yes, it is--but what are you to do with old ladies who won't listen to
reason? She looked pretty sharply to see that I had got the wording
fierce enough before she would put her name to it."

"Yes, it is--but what are you to do with old ladies who won't listen to
reason? She looked pretty sharply to see that I had got the wording
fierce enough before she would put her name to it."

==> "It must have depressed Philip Boyes all right," said Wimsey. "Thank <==
you--I'm glad I've seen that; it makes the suicide theory a good deal
more probable."

In theory it might do so, but the theory did not square as well as
Wimsey could have wished with what he had heard about the character of

[line number in individual story] matching line = 4541    window = 4536 4546

In theory it might do so, but the theory did not square as well as
==> Wimsey could have wished with what he had heard about the character of <==
Philip Boyes. Personally, he was inclined to put more faith in the idea
that the final interview with Harriet had been the deciding factor in
the suicide. But this, too, was not quite satisfactory. He could not
believe that Philip had felt that particular kind of affection for
Harriet Vane. Perhaps, though, it was merely that he did not want to

she could write well, but undoubtedly she knew only too much about the
administration of arsenic. Moreover, the book was about two artists who
lived in Bloomsbury and led an ideal existence, full of love and
laughter and poverty, till somebody unkindly poisoned the young man and
left the young woman inconsolable and passionately resolved to avenge
==> him. Wimsey ground his teeth and went down to Holloway Gaol, where he <==
very nearly made a jealous exhibition of himself. Fortunately, his sense
of humour came to the rescue when he had cross-examined his client to
the verge of exhaustion and tears.

"I'm sorry," he said; "the fact is, I'm most damnably jealous of this

"And if I was, I shouldn't be fit to live with. Is that it?"

"You would be very unhappy. Quite apart from all the other drawbacks."

==> "But, look here," said Wimsey, "if you married me I shouldn't be <==
jealous, because then I should know that you really liked me and all
that."

"You think you wouldn't be. But you would."

married a widow. Are all second husbands jealous?"

"I don't know. But it's not quite the same. You'd never really trust me,
and we should be wretched."

==> "But damn it all," said Wimsey, "if you would once say you cared a bit <==
about me it would be all right. I should believe that. It's because you
won't say it that I imagine all sort of things."

"You would go on imagining things in spite of yourself. You couldn't
give me a square deal. No man ever does."

"Never?"

"Well, hardly ever."

==> "That would be rotten," said Wimsey, seriously. "Of course, if I turned <==
out to be that sort of idiot, things would be pretty hopeless. I know
what you mean. I knew a bloke once who got that jealous bug. If his wife
wasn't always hanging round his neck, he said it showed he meant nothing
to her, and if she did express her affection he called her a hypocrite.
It got quite impossible, and she ran away with somebody she didn't care

understanding. I loathe being helped and understood. And, after all,
there was nothing in any of them--except Barbara, of course."

"Who was Barbara?" asked Harriet, quickly.

==> "Oh, a girl. I owe her quite a lot, really," replied Wimsey, musingly. <==
"When she married the other fellow, I took up sleuthing as a cure for
wounded feelings, and it's really been great fun, take it all in all.
Dear me, yes--I was very much bowled over that time. I even took a
special course in logic for her sake."

But I've lost my nerve, somehow."

"No wonder, poor kid. But you'll get over it. Just keep on smiling, and
leave it to Uncle Peter."

==> When Wimsey got home, he found a note awaiting him. <==

         Dear Lord Peter,

         As you saw, I got the job. Miss Climpson sent six of us,
    all with      different stories and testimonials, of course, and

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 42120    window = 42115 42125


         Further reports when anything turns up.

                                                Yours sincerely,
                                                     Joan Murchison.

==> "Megatherium Trust?" said Wimsey. "That's a nice thing for a respectable <==
solicitor to get mixed up with. I'll ask Freddy Arbuthnot. He's an ass
about everything except stocks and shares, but he does understand them,
for some ungodly reason."

He read the letter again, mechanically noting that it was typed on a

                              CHAPTER XII


==> Wimsey was accustomed to say, when he was an old man and more talkative <==
even than usual, that the recollection of that Christmas at Duke's
Denver had haunted him in nightmares, every night regularly, for the
following twenty years. But it is possible that he remembered it with
advantages. There is no doubt that it tried his temper severely. It
began inauspiciously at the tea-table, when Mrs. "Freak" Dimsworthy

"Well, I wouldn't have the muck in the house," said the Captain, firmly.
"I caught Hilda with it, and I said, 'Now you send that book straight
back to the library.' I don't often interfere, but one must draw the
line somewhere."

==> "How did you know what it was like?" asked Wimsey, innocently. <==

"Why, James Douglas' article in the _Express_ was good enough for me,"
said Captain Bates. "The paragraphs he quoted were filthy, positively
filthy."


[line number in individual story] matching line = 4746    window = 4741 4751

"Why, James Douglas' article in the _Express_ was good enough for me,"
said Captain Bates. "The paragraphs he quoted were filthy, positively
filthy."

==> "Well, it's a good thing we've all read them," said Wimsey. "Forewarned <==
is forearmed."

"We owe a great debt of gratitude to the press," said the Dowager
Duchess, "so kind of them to pick out all the plums for us and save the
trouble of reading the books, don't you think, and such a joy for the

"Still, I don't suppose the young woman murdered him on that account,"
said her daughter-in-law. "From all accounts she was just as bad as he
was."

==> "Oh, come," said Wimsey, "you can't think that, Helen. Damn it, she <==
writes detective stories and in detective stories virtue is always
triumphant. They're the purest literature we have."

"The devil is always ready to quote scripture when it pays him to do
so," said the younger Duchess, "and they say the wretched woman's sales

publicity stunt gone wrong." He was a large, jovial man, extremely rich
and connected with the City. "You never know what these advertising
fellows are up to."

"Well, it looks like a case of hanging the goose that lays the golden
==> eggs this time," said Captain Bates, with a loud laugh. "Unless Wimsey <==
means to pull off one of his conjuring tricks."

"I hope he does," said Miss Titterton. "I adore detective stories. I'd
commute the sentence to penal servitude on condition that she turned out
a new story every six months. It would be much more useful than picking

"I hope he does," said Miss Titterton. "I adore detective stories. I'd
commute the sentence to penal servitude on condition that she turned out
a new story every six months. It would be much more useful than picking
oakum or sewing mail-bags for the post-office to mislay."

==> "Aren't you being a bit previous?" suggested Wimsey, mildly. "She's not <==
convicted yet."

"But she will be next time. You can't fight facts, Peter."

"Of course not," said Captain Bates. "The police know what they're

I wonder Peter isn't afraid he'll give warning one of these days, but I
really believe he is positively attached to him, Bunter attached to
Peter, I mean, though the other way on would be true too, I'm sure Peter
pays more attention to his opinion than he does to mine."

==> Wimsey had escaped, and was by now on his way to the stables. He met <==
Gerald, Duke of Denver, returning, with Freddy Arbuthnot in tow. The
former received the Dowager's message with a grin.

"Got to turn up, I suppose," he said. "I wish nobody had ever invented
tea. Ruins your nerves and spoils your appetite for dinner."

[line number in individual story] matching line = 4872    window = 4867 4877

tea. Ruins your nerves and spoils your appetite for dinner."

"Beastly sloppy stuff," agreed the Hon. Freddy. "I say, Peter, I've been
wanting to get hold of you."

==> "Same here," said Wimsey, promptly. "I'm feelin' rather exhausted with <==
conversation. Let's wander through the billiard-room and build our
constitutions up before we face the barrage."

"Today's great thought," said Freddy, enthusiastically. He pattered
happily after Wimsey into the billiard-room, and flung himself down in a

"Same here," said Wimsey, promptly. "I'm feelin' rather exhausted with

"Today's great thought," said Freddy, enthusiastically. He pattered
==> happily after Wimsey into the billiard-room, and flung himself down in a <==
large chair. "Great bore, Christmas, isn't it? All the people one hates
most gathered together in the name of goodwill and all that."

"Bring a couple of whiskies," said Wimsey to the footman. "And, James,
if anybody asks for Mr. Arbuthnot or me, you rather think we have gone

==> "Bring a couple of whiskies," said Wimsey to the footman. "And, James, <==
if anybody asks for Mr. Arbuthnot or me, you rather think we have gone
out. Well, Freddy, here's luck! Has anything transpired, as the
journalists say?"

"I've been sleuthing like stink on the tracks of your man," said Mr.

so on. And Goldberg will be all right, because, don't you see, he's a
cousin of old Levy's, who was murdered, you know, and all these Jews
stick together like leeches and as a matter of fact, I think it's very
fine of them."

==> "But what has old Levy got to do with it?" asked Wimsey, his mind <==
running over the incidents in that half-forgotten murder-episode.

"Well, as a matter of fact," said the Hon. Freddy, a little nervously,
"I've--er--done the trick as you might say. Rachel Levy is--er, in
fact--going to become Mrs. Freddy and all that sort of thing."

"Well, as a matter of fact," said the Hon. Freddy, a little nervously,
"I've--er--done the trick as you might say. Rachel Levy is--er, in

==> "The devil she is," said Wimsey, ringing the bell. "Tremendous <==
congratters and all that. It's been a long time working up, hasn't it?"

"Why, yes," said Freddy. "Yes, it has. You see, the trouble was that I
was a Christian--at least, I was christened and all that, though I
pointed out I wasn't at all a good one, except, of course, that one

minutes late and I had to do something, and somebody had left a Bible in
the pew. I saw that--I say, old Laban was a bit of a tough, wasn't
he?--and I said to myself, 'I'll work that off next time I call,' and so
I did, and the old lady was uncommonly touched by it."

==> "And the long and the short of it is, you're fixed up," said Wimsey. <==
"Well, cheerio, here's to it. Am I best man, Freddy, or do you bring it
off at the Synagogue?"

"Well, yes--it is to be at the Synagogue--I had to agree to that," said
Freddy, "but I believe some sort of bridegroom's friend comes into it.

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 42399    window = 42394 42404


"Well, yes--it is to be at the Synagogue--I had to agree to that," said
Freddy, "but I believe some sort of bridegroom's friend comes into it.
You'll stand by me, old bean, won't you? You keep your hat on, don't
forget."

==> "I'll bear it in mind," said Wimsey, "and Bunter will explain the <==
procedure to me. He's bound to know. He knows everything. But look here,
Freddy, you won't forget about this little enquiry, will you?"

"I won't, old chap--upon my word I won't. I'll let you know the very
second I hear anything. But I really think you may count on there being

"I won't, old chap--upon my word I won't. I'll let you know the very
second I hear anything. But I really think you may count on there being
something in it."

==> Wimsey found some consolation in this. At any rate, he so far pulled <==
himself together as to be the life and soul of the rather restrained
revels at Duke's Denver. The Duchess Helen, indeed, observed rather
acidly to the Duke that Peter was surely getting too old to play the
buffoon, and that it would be better if he took things seriously and
settled down.

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 42418    window = 42413 42423



"Oh, I dunno," said the Duke, "Peter's a weird fish--you never know what
he's thinkin' about. He pulled me out of the soup once and I'm not going
to interfere with him. You leave him alone, Helen."

==> Lady Mary Wimsey, who had arrived late on Christmas Eve, took another <==
view of the matter. She marched into her younger brother's bedroom at 2
o'clock on the morning of Boxing Day. There had been dinner and dancing
and charades of the most exhausting kind. Wimsey was sitting
thoughtfully over the fire in his dressing-gown.

Lady Mary Wimsey, who had arrived late on Christmas Eve, took another
view of the matter. She marched into her younger brother's bedroom at 2
o'clock on the morning of Boxing Day. There had been dinner and dancing

"I say, old Peter," said Lady Mary, "you're being a bit fevered, aren't

thoughtfully over the fire in his dressing-gown.

"I say, old Peter," said Lady Mary, "you're being a bit fevered, aren't
you? Anything up?"

==> "Too much plum-pudding," said Wimsey, "and too much county. I'm a <==
martyr, that's what I am--burning in brandy to make a family holiday."

"Yes, it's ghastly, isn't it? But how's life? I haven't seen you for an
age. You've been away such a long time."

"Have you? He's a very decent sort. Reliable, home-spun--that sort of
thing. Not amusing, exactly."

"A little solid."

==> "As you say--a little solid." Wimsey lit a cigarette. "I should hate <==
anything upsettin' to happen to Parker. He'd take it hard. I mean to
say, it wouldn't be fair to muck about with his feelin's and so on."

Mary laughed.

"Like me with the house-decorating. I designed these pajamas, by the
way. Don't you think they're rather entertaining? But I expect
Chief-Inspector Parker prefers the old-fashioned night-gown, like Dr.
Spooner or whoever it was."

==> "That would be a wrench," said Wimsey. <==

"Never mind. I'll be brave and devoted. Here and now I cast off my
pajamas for ever!"

"No, no," said Wimsey, "not here and now. Respect a brother's feelings.

Very well. I am to tell my friend Charles Parker, that if he will
abandon his natural modesty and propose, you will abandon your pajamas
and say yes."

"It will be a great shock for Helen, Peter."

"Blast Helen. I daresay it won't be the worst shock she'll get."

"Peter, you're plotting something devilish. All right. If you want me to
administer the first shock and let her down by degrees--I'll do it."

==> "Right-ho!" said Wimsey, casually. <==

Lady Mary twisted one arm about his neck and bestowed on him one of her
rare sisterly caresses.

"You're a decent old idiot," she said, "and you look played-out. Go to

who kept a typing bureau.

It was not what she wanted, but she went. And she found that it was not
quite a typing bureau after all, but something more interesting.

==> Lord Peter Wimsey, mysteriously at the back of it all, had been abroad <==
when Miss Murchison entered the "Cattery," and she had never seen him
till a few weeks ago. This would be the first time she had actually
spoken to him. An odd-looking person, she thought, but people said he
had brains. Anyhow--

work, I suppose? How's our Mr. Urquhart?"

"He's all right." Miss Murchison had never been a chatty girl. "There's
one thing I wanted to tell you--"

==> "Plenty of time," said Wimsey. "Don't spoil your tea." He waited on her <==
with a kind of anxious courtesy which pleased her. She expressed
admiration of the big bronze chrysanthemums heaped here and there about
the room.

"Oh! I'm glad you like them. My friends say they give a feminine touch

"I suppose so."

"Unless one is absolutely first-class, and I should never have been
that. And third-class musicians are a nuisance."

==> "They have a rotten time, too," said Wimsey. "I hate to see them in <==
cinemas, poor beasts, playing the most ghastly tripe, sandwiched in with
snacks of Mendelssohn and torn-off gobbets of the 'Unfinished.' Have a
sandwich. Do you like Bach? or only the Moderns?"

He wriggled on to the piano stool.

"Anything fresh?"

"No--except that the evening after you called at Mr. Urquhart's office,
he stayed on a long time after we had gone, typing something."

"How do you know how long he stayed and what he was doing if you had all
gone?"

"You said you wanted to know of anything, however small, that was in the

"Perhaps the charwoman disturbed them?"

"Not she. She never disturbs the dust, let alone the cover."

==> Wimsey nodded. <==

"You have the makings of a first-class sleuth, Miss Murchison. Very
well. In that case, our little job will have to be undertaken. Now, look
here--you quite understand that I'm going to ask you to do something
illegal?"

me. And it would look funny if I wanted to stay on after four-thirty, I
expect. Unless I pretended I had made a mistake and wanted to stay and
put it right. I could do that. I might come extra early in the morning
when the charwoman is there--or would it matter her seeing me?"

==> "It wouldn't matter very much," said Wimsey, thoughtfully. "She'd <==
probably think you had legitimate business with the box. I'll leave it
to you to choose the time."

"But what am I to do? Steal the box?"

"Not quite. Do you know how to pick a lock?"

"Not in the least, I'm afraid."

==> "I often wonder what we go to school for," said Wimsey. "We never seem <==
to learn anything really useful. I can pick quite a pretty lock myself,
but, as we haven't much time and as you'll need some rather intensive
training, I think I'd better take you to an expert. Should you mind
putting your coat on and coming round with me to see a friend?"

"He lives in the Whitechapel Road, but he's a very pleasant fellow, if
you can overlook his religious opinions. Personally, I find them rather

to Miss Murchison's disquietude; she began to think there was something
a little sinister in this pointed refusal to discuss the object of their
journey.

said Esmeralda, her mouth drooping.

The room was small, very hot and very full of people. In one corner was
the harmonium, with the musicians grouped about it. In the middle,
standing by a round table covered with a red cloth, was a stout, square
man, with a face like a bull-dog. He had a book in his hand, and
==> appeared to be about to announce a hymn, but, seeing Wimsey and Miss <==
Murchison, he came forward, stretching out a large and hearty hand.

"Welcome one and welcome all!" he said. "Brethren, 'ere is a dear

'eaven's mercies in Number One 'Undred and Two. (Esmeralda, give our
dear friends a 'ymn-book.)"

==> "I'm sorry," said Wimsey to Miss Murchison. "Can you bear it? I fancy <==
this is the final outbreak."

The harmonium, harp, sackbut, psaltery, dulcimer and all kinds of music
burst out with a blare which nearly burst the ear-drum, the assembly
lifted its combined voices, and Miss Murchison, to her amazement, found

            "Sweeping through the gates,
            Sweeping through the gates of the New Jerusalem,
            Washed in the Blood of the Lamb."

==> Wimsey, who appeared to find it all very good fun, carolled away <==
happily, without the slightest embarrassment; whether because he was
accustomed to the exercise, or merely because he was one of those
imperturbably self-satisfied people who cannot conceive of themselves as
being out of place in any surroundings, Miss Murchison was unable to
determine.

she was the wife of Mr. Bill Rumm and the mother of Esmeralda.

"Well, now," said Bill, "it's dry work preachin' and singin'--you'll
take a cup of tea or coffee, now, won't you?"

==> Wimsey explained that they had just had tea, but begged that the family <==
might proceed with their own meal.

"It ain't 'ardly supper-time yet," said Mrs. Rumm. "P'raps if you was to
do your business with the lady and gentleman, Bill, they might feel
inclined to take a bite with us later. It's trotters," she added,

inclined to take a bite with us later. It's trotters," she added,
hopefully.

"It's very kind of you," said Miss Murchison, hesitatingly.

==> "Trotters want a lot of beating," said Wimsey, "and since our business <==
may take a little time we'll accept with pleasure--if you're sure we're
not putting you out."

"Not at all," said Mrs. Rumm, heartily. "Eight beautiful trotters they

"Always 'appy to serve you, sir, knowing as it's the Lord's work. Glory
be."

==> "Thank you," said Wimsey, modestly. "It's a simple matter, Bill, but as <==
the young lady is inexperienced with locks and so on, I've brought her
along to be coached. You see, Miss Murchison, before Bill here saw the
light--"

"Praise God!" put in Bill.

"And oh! what 'appiness it is, miss, to turn them talents which I so
wickedly abused to the service of the Lord. His 'oly Name be blessed
that bringeth good out of evil."

==> "That's right," said Wimsey, with a nod. "Now, Bill, I've got my eye on <==
a solicitor's deed-box, which may or may not contain something which
will help me to get an innocent person out of trouble. This young lady
can get access to the box, Bill, if you can show her the way inside it."

"If?" grunted Bill, with sovereign contempt. "'Course I can! Deed-box,

"That's what they are, miss. Ingines of Satan!" He shook his head as he
lovingly fingered the bright steel. "Many's the time sech keys as these
'ave let pore sinners in by the back gate into 'ell."

"Praise Him for His manifold mercies! Well, miss, the fust thing is to
understand the construction of a lock. Now jest you look 'ere."

for religion,' 'e ses, pore lost sheep, 'but I ain't got no quarrel with

==> "Bill, Bill," said Wimsey, shaking a reproachful finger, "I'm afraid <==
this wasn't honestly come by."

"Well, sir, if I knowed the owner I'd 'and it over to 'im with the
greatest of pleasure. It's quite good, you see. Sam put the soup in at

greatest of pleasure. It's quite good, you see. Sam put the soup in at
the 'inges and it blowed the 'ole front clean off, lock and all. It's
small, but it's a real beauty--new pattern to me, that is. But I
mastered it," said Bill, with unregenerate pride, "in an hour or two."

==> "It'd have to be a good bit of work to beat you, Bill"; Wimsey set the <==
lock up before him, and began to manipulate the knob, his fingers moving
with micrometer delicacy and his ear bent to catch the fall of the
tumblers.

"Lord!" said Bill--this time with no religious intention--"wot a

"Lord!" said Bill--this time with no religious intention--"wot a
cracksman you'd a-made, if you'd a-given your mind to it--which the Lord
in His mercy forbid you should!"

==> "Too much work in that life for me, Bill," said Wimsey. "Dash it! I lost <==
it that time."

He turned the knob back and started over again.

By the time the trotters arrived, Miss Murchison had acquired

"And don't you let yourself be 'urried, miss," was Bill's final
injunction, "else you'll leave scratches on the lock and do yourself no
credit. Lovely bit of work, that, ain't it, Lord Peter, sir?"

==> "Beyond me, I'm afraid," said Wimsey, with a laugh. <==

"Practice," said Bill, "that's all it is. If you'd a-started early
enough you'd a-been a beautiful workman." He sighed. "There ain't many
of 'em now-a-days--glory be!--that can do a real artistic job. It fair
goes to my 'eart to see a elegant bit o' stuff like that blowed all to

"Ain't that 'jest like a woman?--beggin' your pardon, miss."

"Well, you know it's true," said Mrs. Rumm.

==> "I know those trotters look very artistic," said Wimsey, "and that's <==
quite enough for me."

The trotters having been eaten, and "Nazareth" duly sung, to the great
admiration of the Rumm family, the evening closed pleasantly with the
performance of a hymn, and Miss Murchison found herself walking up the

[line number in individual story] matching line = 5620    window = 5615 5625

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 43062    window = 43057 43067


and is doing very well at it. Do you feel quite competent about locks
now?"

"I think so. What am I to look for when I get the box open?"

==> "Well," said Wimsey, "the point is this. Mr. Urquhart showed me what <==
purported to be the draft of a will made five years ago by Mrs.
Wrayburn. I've written down the gist of it on a bit of paper for you.
Here it is. Now the snag about it is that that draft was typed on a
machine which, as you tell me, was bought new from the makers only three
years ago."

[line number in individual story] matching line = 5657    window = 5652 5662

provisions in your head if you can and note them down privately when you
get away from the office. And be sure you don't leave those skeleton
keys about for people to find."

Miss Murchison promised to observe these instructions, and, a taxi
==> coming up at that moment, Wimsey put her into it and sped her to her <==
destination.

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 43423    window = 43418 43428


from tenants, bankers and stockbrokers, with copies of the replies
written from the office and signed by Norman Urquhart.

Miss Murchison hastened impatiently through all this. There was no sign
of a will or copy of a will--not even of the dubious draft that the
==> solicitor had shown to Wimsey. Two papers only now remained at the <==
bottom of the box. Miss Murchison picked up the first. It was a Power of
Attorney, dated January 1925, giving Norman Urquhart full powers to act
for Mrs. Wrayburn. The second was thicker and tied neatly with red tape.
Miss Murchison slipped this off and unfolded the document.


[line number in individual story] matching line = 6082    window = 6077 6087

that appreciate such things. Indeed, Miss Murchison was a little late in
returning to Mr. Urquhart's office, and in her haste omitted to hand
back the skeleton keys. But when the wine is good and the company
agreeable one cannot always think of everything.

==> Wimsey himself, by a great act of self-control, had returned to his own <==
flat to think, instead of bolting away to Holloway Gaol. Although it was
a work of charity and necessity to keep up the spirits of the prisoner
(it was in this way that he excused his almost daily visits) he could
not disguise from himself that it would be even more useful and
charitable to get her innocence proved. So far, he had not made much

prescribe a hot bath and massage. And next day a new mirror would be
ordered, because people would come in and ask questions, and civilly
regret the accidental damage to the old one. And Harriet Vane would
still be hanged, just the same.

==> Wimsey pulled himself together, called for his hat and coat, and went <==
away in a taxi to call on Miss Climpson.

"I have a job," he said to her, more abruptly than was his wont, "which
I should like you to undertake yourself. I can't trust anybody else."


[line number in individual story] matching line = 6158    window = 6153 6163

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 43600    window = 43595 43605


you've got to find out where her will is kept, and, if possible, see
it."

"Dear me!" said Miss Climpson.

==> "You see," said Wimsey, "unless we can give some very good reason for <==
delay, they're bound to take the Vane case almost first thing next
sessions. If I could persuade the lawyers for the defence that there is
the least chance of securing fresh evidence, they could apply for a
postponement. But at present I have nothing that could be called
evidence--only the vaguest possible hunch."

"I see," said Miss Climpson. "Well, none of us can do more than our
best, and it is very necessary to have Faith. That moves mountains, we
are told."

==> "Then for Heaven's sake lay in a good stock of it," said Wimsey, <==
gloomily, "because as far as I can see, this job is like shifting the
Himalayas and the Alps, with a spot of frosty Caucasus and a touch of
the Rockies thrown in."

"You may count on me to do my poor best," replied Miss Climpson, "and I

"You may count on me to do my poor best," replied Miss Climpson, "and I
will ask the dear vicar to say a Mass of special intention for one
engaged in a difficult undertaking. When would you like me to start?"

==> "At once," said Wimsey. "I think you had better go just as your ordinary <==
self, and put up at the local hotel--no--a boarding-house, there will be
more opportunities for gossip. I don't know much about Windle, except
that there is a boot-factory there and rather a good view, but it's not
a large place, and I should think everybody would know about Mrs.
Wrayburn. She is very rich, and was notorious in her time. The person

anything--anything at all--to his disadvantage. He's Mrs. Wrayburn's
great-nephew, and goes to see her sometimes."

Miss Climpson made a note of these instructions.

==> "And now I'll tootle off and leave you to it," said Wimsey. "Draw on the <==
firm for any money you want. And if you need any special outfit, send me
a wire."

On leaving Miss Climpson, Lord Peter Wimsey again found himself a prey
to Weltschmerz and self-pity. But it now took the form of a gentle,

==> On leaving Miss Climpson, Lord Peter Wimsey again found himself a prey <==
to Weltschmerz and self-pity. But it now took the form of a gentle,
pervading melancholy. Convinced of his own futility, he determined to do
what little good lay in his power before retiring to a monastery or to
the frozen wastes of the Antarctic. He taxied purposefully round to
Scotland Yard, and asked for Chief-Inspector Parker.

what little good lay in his power before retiring to a monastery or to

Scotland Yard, and asked for Chief-Inspector Parker.

Parker was in his office, reading a report which had just come in. He

delighted.

"Have you come about that packet of powder?"

"Have you come about that packet of powder?"

==> "Not this time," said Wimsey, "I don't suppose you'll ever hear anything <==
more of that. No. It's--rather a more--er--delicate matter. It's about
my sister."

Parker started and pushed the report to one side.

all that sort of thing, what?"

"Lady Mary has honoured me--on one or two occasions--with her company,"
said Parker. "I did not think--I did not know--that is I understood--"

==> "Ah! but _did_ you understand, that's the point?" said Wimsey, solemnly. <==
"You see, Mary's a very nice-minded sort of girl, though I say it,
and--"

"I assure you," said Parker, "that there is no need to tell me that. Do
you suppose that I should misinterpret her kindness. It is the custom

"I assure you," said Parker, "that there is no need to tell me that. Do

now-a-days for women of the highest character to dine unchaperoned with
their friends, and Lady Mary has--"

brother, and all that--it's Gerald's job really, of course, but Mary and
he don't altogether hit it off, you know, and she wouldn't be likely to
burble any secrets into his ear, especially as it would all be handed on

I suppose it's my so to speak duty to push round and drop the helpful
word here and there."

Parker jabbed the blotting-paper thoughtfully.

Parker stared at him.

like a demented sheep at my sister, and starting like a rabbit whenever
her name is mentioned. What do you mean by it? It is not ornamental. It
is not exhilarating. You unnerve the poor girl. You give me a poor idea

"Do you--are you asking me--?"

not Victorian enough, I don't know what is. I quite understand your
having given Mary time to recover from that unfortunate affair with
Cathcart and the Goyles fellow, but, dash it all, my dear man, one can

touching." He was only moderately cheered by hearing from the
industrious Freddy Arbuthnot that Mr. Norman Urquhart was found to be
more or less deeply involved in the disasters of the Megatherium Trust.

Miss Kitty Climpson, on the other hand, was living in what she herself

with the demon. Even in a righteous cause, could anything so wicked be
justified?

She breathed what she thought was a prayer for guidance, but the only
answer was a small whisper in her ear, "Oh, jolly good work, Miss
==> Climpson!" and the voice was the voice of Peter Wimsey. <==

"Pardon me," said Miss Climpson, "but I see you are a student of
spiritualism. How interesting that is!"

If there was one subject in the world about which Miss Climpson might

tea-pot on the hob and the will once more lying innocently on the table,
she smiled and breathed deeply. Her mission was accomplished.

                 *        *        *        *        *

==> Letter from Miss Climpson to Lord Peter Wimsey. <==

                                              Tuesday, Jan. 7, 1930.

         My dear Lord Peter,


[line number in individual story] matching line = 8354    window = 8349 8359

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 45796    window = 45791 45801



"All the same, Bunter, I really don't know how it _was_ done."

"That will undoubtedly suggest itself before long, my lord."

==> "Oh, yes," said Wimsey, airily. "Of course. Of course. I'm not worrying <==
about a trifle like that."





[line number in individual story] matching line = 8435    window = 8430 8440

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 45877    window = 45872 45882


would take your notes clearly at the time. If I am going too fast for
you, you should tell me so. It would save trouble in the end--wouldn't
it?"

Miss Murchison was reminded of a little set of rules which Lord Peter
==> Wimsey--half in jest and half in earnest--had once prepared for the <==
guidance of "The Cattery." Of Rule Seven, in particular, which ran:
"Always distrust the man who looks you straight in the eyes. He wants to
prevent you from seeing something. Look for it."

She shifted her eyes under her employer's gaze.

[line number in individual story] matching line = 8647    window = 8642 8652

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 46089    window = 46084 46094


happy together. Have you had tea? or will you absorb a spot of
something?"

Miss Murchison declined refreshment.

==> "H'm!" said Wimsey. "The patient refuses food. Her eyes glitter wildly. <==
The expression is anxious. The lips are parted. The fingers fumble with
clasp of the bag. The symptoms point to an acute attack of
communicativeness. Tell us the worst, Miss Murchison."

Miss Murchison needed no urging. She told her adventures, and had the

[line number in individual story] matching line = 8658    window = 8653 8663

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 46100    window = 46095 46105


pleasure of holding her audience enthralled from the first word to the
last. When she finally produced the screw of paper containing the white
powder, the sentiments of the company expressed themselves in a round of
applause, in which Bunter joined discreetly.

==> "Are you convinced, Charles?" asked Wimsey. <==

"I admit that I am heavily shaken," said Parker. "Of course, the powder
must be analysed--"

"It shall, embodied caution," said Wimsey. "Bunter, make ready the rack

"Are you convinced, Charles?" asked Wimsey.

"I admit that I am heavily shaken," said Parker. "Of course, the powder
must be analysed--"

==> "It shall, embodied caution," said Wimsey. "Bunter, make ready the rack <==
and thumbscrew. Bunter has been taking lessons in Marsh's test, and
performs it to admiration. You know all about it too, Charles, don't
you?"

"Enough for a rough test."

there is no doubt that the draft itself was drawn out by Urquhart,
certainly within the last three years and probably within the last few
days. Moreover, the fact that the actual Will, though lying in a place
accessible to Urquhart, was not destroyed by him, suggests that it was
not, in fact, superseded by any subsequent testamentary disposition. By
==> the way, Wimsey, why didn't he simply take the will and destroy it? As <==
the sole surviving heir, he would then inherit without dispute."

"Perhaps it didn't occur to him. Or there might even be other relatives
surviving. How about that uncle in Australia?"

dealings will not be exposed.

"So far, the evidence as to motive is extremely cogent, and far more
convincing than the evidence against Miss Vane.

==> "But here is your snag, Wimsey. When and how was the poison <==
administered? We know that Miss Vane possessed arsenic and that she
could easily have given it to him without witnesses. But Urquhart's only
opportunity was at the dinner he shared with Boyes, and if anything in
this case is certain, it is that the poison was not administered at that
dinner. Everything which Boyes ate or drank was equally eaten and drunk

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 46217    window = 46212 46222


this case is certain, it is that the poison was not administered at that
dinner. Everything which Boyes ate or drank was equally eaten and drunk
by Urquhart and the servants, with the single exception of the burgundy,
which was preserved and analysed and found to be harmless."

==> "I know," said Wimsey, "but that is what is so suspicious. Did you ever <==
hear of a meal hedged round with such precautions? It's not natural,
Charles. There's the sherry, poured out by the maid from the original
bottle, the soup, fish and casseroled chicken--so impossible to poison
in one portion without poisoning the whole--the omelette, so
ostentatiously prepared at the table by the hands of the victim--the

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 46308    window = 46303 46313



"But that may be the merest hypocrisy," said Miss Murchison, rather
warmly, for she was militantly rationalist. "I don't trust these
unctuous people."

==> "I didn't offer that as a proof of Hannah's virtue," said Wimsey, "but <==
of Bunter's unsusceptibility."

"But he looks like a deacon himself."

"You've never seen Bunter off duty," said Lord Peter, darkly. "I have,

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 46322    window = 46317 46327



"Then that definitely cuts out the drinks and the dinner," said Miss
Murchison, unconvinced, but willing to be open-minded. "How about the
water-bottle in the bedroom?"

==> "The devil!" cried Wimsey. "That's one up to you, Miss Murchison. We <==
didn't think of that. The water-bottle--yes--a perfectly fruity idea.
You recollect, Charles, that in the Bravo case, it was suggested that a
disgruntled servant had put tartar emetic in the water-bottle. Oh,
Bunter--here you are! Next time you hold Hannah's hand, will you ask her
whether Mr. Boyes drank any water from his bedroom water-bottle before

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 46376    window = 46371 46381



"Well, then," said Parker, "Urquhart or somebody must have emptied it
and dried it out. Now, why? What would one naturally do if one found
one's water-bottle empty?"

==> "Ring the bell," said Wimsey, promptly. <==

"Or shout for help," added Parker.

"Or," said Miss Murchison, "if one wasn't accustomed to being waited on,
one might use the water from the bedroom jug."

[line number in individual story] matching line = 8943    window = 8938 8948

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 46385    window = 46380 46390


"Or," said Miss Murchison, "if one wasn't accustomed to being waited on,
one might use the water from the bedroom jug."

"Ah! ... of course Boyes was used to a more or less Bohemian life."

==> "But surely," said Wimsey, "that's idiotically roundabout. It would be <==
much simpler just to poison the water in the bottle. Why direct
attention to the thing by making it more difficult? Besides, you
couldn't count on the victim's using the jug-water--and, as a matter of
fact, he didn't."

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 46398    window = 46393 46403



"No--I'm afraid there's nothing to be got out of the jug and bottle
department. Hollow, hollow, hollow all delight, Tennyson."

"All the same," said Parker, "that incident convinces me. It's too
==> complete, somehow. Wimsey's right; it's not natural for a defence to be <==
so perfect."

"My God," said Wimsey, "we have convinced Charles Parker. Nothing more
is needed. He is more adamantine than any jury."

"All the same," said Parker, "that incident convinces me. It's too
complete, somehow. Wimsey's right; it's not natural for a defence to be
so perfect."

==> "My God," said Wimsey, "we have convinced Charles Parker. Nothing more <==
is needed. He is more adamantine than any jury."

"Yes," said Parker, modestly, "but I'm more logical, I think. And I'm
not being flustered by the Attorney-General. I should feel happier with
a little evidence of a more objective kind."

[line number in individual story] matching line = 8985    window = 8980 8990

from contamination."

"I see nothing at all," said Freddy.

"That, as Sherlock Holmes would say, is what you may expect to see when
==> there is nothing there," said Wimsey, kindly. "Charles, you will pass <==
the water and the flask and the tube, old Uncle Tom Cobley and all as
being arsenic-free."

"I will."

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 46453    window = 46448 46458



Miss Murchison blushed, and fumbled in her handbag.

"Well--there's a little note I scribbled this afternoon to a friend--"

==> "_In_ your employer's time, _on_ your employer's paper," said Wimsey. <==
"Oh, how right Diogenes was when he took his lantern to look for an
honest typist! Never mind. Let's have it. Who wills the end, wills the
means."

Miss Murchison extracted the envelope and freed it from the enclosure.

[line number in individual story] matching line = 9024    window = 9019 9029

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 46466    window = 46461 46471


brightly, but the little tubes still remained stainless from end to end.

"Does something begin to happen soon?" enquired Mr. Arbuthnot. "Because
I feel this show's a bit lackin' in pep, what?"

==> "If you don't sit still I shall take you out," retorted Wimsey. "Carry <==
on, Bunter. We'll pass the envelope."

Bunter accordingly opened the second envelope, and delicately dropped
the white powder into the wide mouth of the flask. All five heads bent
eagerly over the apparatus. And presently, definitely, magically, a thin

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 46482    window = 46477 46487



"Your lamp's smoking or something," said Freddy.

"Is that arsenic?" breathed Miss Murchison, gently.

==> "I hope so," said Wimsey, gently detaching the tube and holding it up to <==
the light "It's either arsenic or antimony."

"Allow me, my lord. The addition of a small quantity of solute
chlorinated lime should decide the question beyond reach of cavil."


[line number in individual story] matching line = 9051    window = 9046 9056

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 46493    window = 46488 46498


He performed this further test amid an anxious silence. The stain
dissolved out and vanished under the bleaching solution.

"Then it is arsenic," said Parker.

==> "Oh, yes," said Wimsey, nonchalantly, "of course it is arsenic. Didn't I <==
tell you?" His voice wavered a little with suppressed triumph.

"Is that all?" inquired Freddy, disappointed.

"Isn't it enough?" said Miss Murchison.

[line number in individual story] matching line = 9072    window = 9067 9077

either before, during or after dinner, during the period required for
the symptoms to develop. I agree that an impossibility so bolstered up
by testimony is suspicious in itself, but, to convince a jury, I should
prefer something better than a _credo quia impossibile_."

==> "Riddle-me-right, and riddle-me-ree," said Wimsey, imperturbably. "We've <==
overlooked something, that's all. Probably something quite obvious. Give
me the statutory dressing-gown and ounce of shag, and I will undertake
to dispose of this little difficulty for you in a brace of shakes. In
the meantime, you will no doubt take steps to secure, in an official and
laborious manner, the evidence which our kind friends here have already

and if the Force has made a mistake, the sooner it's put right the
better for all concerned."

                 *        *        *        *        *

==> Wimsey sat late that night in the black-and-primrose library, with the <==
tall folios looking down at him. They represented the world's
accumulated hoard of mellow wisdom and poetical beauty, to say nothing
of thousands of pounds in cash. But all these counsellors sat mute upon
their shelves. Strewn on tables and chairs lay the bright scarlet
volumes of the Notable British Trials--Palmer, Pritchard, Maybrick,

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 46572    window = 46567 46577



"I've still got to prove it."

"A secondary consideration, my lord."

==> Wimsey yawned. When Bunter returned a minute or two later with the <==
coffee, he was asleep.

Bunter put the books quietly away, and looked with some curiosity at the
chosen few left open on the table. They were: "The Trial of Florence
Maybrick"; Dixon Mann's "Forensic Medicine and Toxicology"; a book with

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 46607    window = 46602 46612


"Well?"

"I'm frightened of it. One couldn't get away. I'll live with you, if you
like, but I won't marry you."

==> Her tone was so unutterably dreary that Wimsey could feel no enthusiasm <==
for this handsome offer.

"But that sort of thing doesn't always work," he expostulated. "Dash it
all, you ought to know--forgive my alluding to it and all that--but it's
frightfully inconvenient, and one has just as many rows as if one was

"Oh, yes, you would. You've got a family and traditions, you know.
Caesar's' wife and that sort of thing."

"Blast Caesar's wife! And as for the family traditions--they're on my

help the person who gets in the way. We've even got a damned old family
motto about it--'I hold by my Whimsy'--quite right too. I can't say that
when I look in the glass I exactly suggest to myself the original Gerald
de Wimsey, who bucked about on a cart horse at the Siege of Acre, but I
do jolly well intend to do what I like about marrying. Who's to stop me?

Harriet laughed.

"I can't," said Harriet, beginning to wilt. "Do please stop asking me. I
don't know. I can't think. I can't see beyond the--beyond the--beyond
the next few weeks. I only want to get out of this and be left alone."

==> "All right," said Wimsey, "I won't worry you. Not fair. Abusing my <==
privilege and so on. You can't say 'Pig' and sweep out, under the
circs., so I won't offend again. As a matter of fact I'll sweep out
myself, having an appointment--with a manicurist. Nice little girl, but
a trifle refained in her vowels. Cheerio!"

astonishment.

"Why, of course I could," she said finally, "but whatever do you want
them for? Seems funny to me."

==> "Call it just a joke," said Wimsey. <==

"No." Her mouth hardened. "I wouldn't like it. It doesn't make sense, if
you see what I mean. What I mean, it sounds a queer sort of joke and
that kind of thing might get a girl into trouble. I say, it's not one of
those, what do they call 'em?--there was a bit about it in Madame

some way off, grew quite peevish with envy, making sure that darling
Mabel was being offered a flat in Paris, a Daimler car and a
thousand-pound necklace, and quarrelled fatally with her own escort in
consequence.

==> "So you see," said Wimsey, "it means a lot to me." <==

Darling Mabel gave an ecstatic sigh.

"Is that all true? You're not making it up? It's better than any of the
talkies."

give you all I get. And I'll fix Fred. He always has Fred. Fred'll do it
if I ask him. What'll I do with them when I get them?"

==> Wimsey drew an envelope from his pocket. <==

"Sealed up inside this," he said, impressively, "there are two little
pill-boxes. You mustn't take them out till you get the specimens,
because they've been carefully prepared so as to be absolutely
chemically clean, if you see what I mean. When you're ready, open the

"Right; then I can send you an unbirthday present any day in the year.
You'd look nice in mink, I think."

"Mink, I think," she mocked him. "Quite a poet, aren't you?"

"I have come round," said Mr. Urquhart, "in answer to your letter. I am
greatly interested to hear that you have some fresh information about my
unfortunate cousin's death. Of course I shall be delighted to give you
any assistance I can."

==> "Thank you," said Wimsey. "Do sit down. You have dined, of course? But <==
you will have a cup of coffee. You prefer the Turkish variety, I fancy.
My man brews it rather well."

Mr. Urquhart accepted the offer, and complimented Bunter on having
achieved the right method of concocting that curiously syrupy brew, so

[line number in individual story] matching line = 9344    window = 9339 9349

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 46786    window = 46781 46791


Bunter thanked him gravely for his good opinion, and proffered a box of
that equally nauseating mess called Turkish Delight, which not only
gluts the palate and glues the teeth, but also smothers the consumer in
a floury cloud of white sugar. Mr. Urquhart immediately plugged his
mouth with a large lump of it, murmuring indistinctly that it was the
==> genuine Eastern variety. Wimsey, with an austere smile, took a few sips <==
of strong black coffee without sugar or milk, and poured himself out a
glass of old brandy. Bunter retired, and Lord Peter, laying a note-book
open upon his knee, glanced at the clock and began his narrative.

He recapitulated the circumstances of Philip Boyes' life and death at

[line number in individual story] matching line = 9353    window = 9348 9358

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 46795    window = 46790 46800



He recapitulated the circumstances of Philip Boyes' life and death at
some length. Mr. Urquhart, yawning surreptitiously, ate, drank and
listened.

==> Wimsey, still with his eye on the clock, then embarked upon the story of <==
Mrs. Wrayburn's will.

Mr. Urquhart, considerably astonished, set his coffee-cup aside, wiped
his sticky fingers upon his handkerchief, and stared.

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 46805    window = 46800 46810



Presently he said:

"May I ask how you have obtained this very remarkable information?"

==> Wimsey waved his hand. <==

"The police," he said, "wonderful thing, police organisation. Surprisin'
what they find out when they put their minds to it. You're not denying
any of it, I presume?"

"I am listening," said Mr. Urquhart, grimly. "When you have finished
this extraordinary statement, I may perhaps discover exactly what it is
I have to deny."

==> "Oh, yes," said Wimsey, "I'll try to make that clear. I'm not a lawyer, <==
of course, but I'm tryin' to be as lucid as I can."

He droned remorselessly on, and the hands of the clock went round.

"So far as I make it out," he said, when he had reviewed the whole

[line number in individual story] matching line = 9399    window = 9394 9404

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 46841    window = 46836 46846


you worked out something ingenious for that? Or am I supposed to have
suborned my cook and parlourmaid to be my accomplices? A little rash of
me, don't you think, and affording remarkable opportunities for
blackmail?"

==> "So rash," said Wimsey, "that it is quite out of the question for a man <==
so full of forethought as yourself. The sealing-up of that bottle of
burgundy, for example, argues a mind alive to possibilities--unusually
so. In fact, the episode attracted my attention from the start."

"Indeed?"

[line number in individual story] matching line = 9414    window = 9409 9419

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 46856    window = 46851 46861


meeting your cousin before a witness and never being left alone with
him--I think that rules out the period before dinner."

"I should think it might."

==> "The sherry," pursued Wimsey, thoughtfully, "It was a new bottle, <==
freshly decanted. The disappearance of the remains might be commented
on. I fancy we can absolve the sherry."

Mr. Urquhart bowed ironically.


[line number in individual story] matching line = 9430    window = 9425 9435

it--a dogma."

"An unsafe attitude of mind," remarked the lawyer, "but in the
circumstances I will not quarrel with it."

==> "Besides," said Wimsey, "if the poison had been given in the soup or the <==
fish, it might have started to work before Philip--I may call him so, I

Hannah Westlock can give the casserole a clean bill of health, I fancy.
And by the way, from the description it must have been most delicious. I
speak as a man with some considerable experience in gastronomic matters,

"What about it?" asked Mr. Urquhart, perhaps a trifle less easily than
before.

"It is not very difficult to introduce powdered arsenic into a cracked
==> egg," said Wimsey. "I have made the experiment myself with a small glass <==
tube. Perhaps a small funnel would be even easier. Arsenic is a fairly
heavy substance--7 or 8 grains will go into a tea-spoon. It collects at
one end of the egg, and any traces on the exterior of the shell can be
readily wiped off. Liquid arsenic could be poured in still more easily,
of course, but for a particular reason I made my experiment with the

eggs, one particular poisoned egg was somehow kept miraculously
separated from the rest and deposited with its load of arsenic at one
end of the omelette only? Or that my cousin deliberately helped himself
to the poisoned end and left the rest to me?"

==> "Not at all, not at all," said Wimsey. "I suggest merely that the <==
arsenic was in the omelette and came there by way of the egg."

Mr. Urquhart threw his match into the fireplace.

"There seem to be some flaws in your theory, as well as in the egg."

He sketched the shape of a noose lightly in the air.

"I don't understand you," said the solicitor, hoarsely.

==> "Oh _you_ know," said Wimsey. "Hemp--what they make ropes of. Great <==
stuff, hemp. Yes, well, about this arsenic. As you know, it's not good
for people in a general way, but there are some people--those tiresome
peasants in Styria one hears so much about--who are supposed to eat it
for fun. It improves their wind, so they say, and clears their
complexions and makes their hair sleek, and they give it to their horses

"None?"

"None."

==> "Then how is it," asked Wimsey, coolly, but with something menacing in <==
his rigidly controlled voice, "how is it that you have this evening
consumed, without apparent effect, a dose of arsenic sufficient to kill
two or three ordinary people? That disgusting sweetmeat on which you
have been gorging yourself in, I may say, a manner wholly unsuited to
your age and position, is smothered in white arsenic. You ate it, God

forgive you, an hour and a half ago. If arsenic can harm you, you should
have been rolling about in agonies for the last hour."

"You devil!"

==> "Couldn't you try to get up a few symptoms?" said Wimsey, sarcastically. <==
"Shall I bring you a basin? Or fetch the doctor? Does your throat burn?
Is your inside convulsed with agony? It is rather late in the day, but
with a little goodwill you could surely produce _some_ display of
feeling, even now."

"You are lying. You wouldn't dare to do such a thing! It would be
murder."

"Not in this case, I fancy. But I am willing to wait and see."

==> Urquhart stared at him. Wimsey got out of his chair in a single swift <==
movement and stood over him.

"I wouldn't use violence if I were you. Let the poisoner stick to his
bottle. Besides, I am armed. Pardon the melodrama. Are you going to be
sick or not?"

"I'm ill."

"Of course; but your tone is not convincing. Through the door, along the

bell.

"I think, Bunter, Mr. Parker may require some assistance in the
bathroom."

==> Bunter departed and Wimsey waited. Presently there were sounds of a <==
scuffle in the distance. A group appeared at the door. Urquhart, very
white, his hair and clothes disordered, flanked by Parker and Bunter,
who held him firmly by the arms.

"Was he sick?" asked Wimsey, with interest.

"No, he wasn't," said Parker, grimly, snapping the handcuffs on his

dressing-room door and ran straight into me. Now don't struggle, my lad,

"And he still doesn't know whether he's poisoned or not?"

"He doesn't seem to think he is. At any rate, he made no effort about
it. His one idea was to hop it."

==> "That's feeble," said Wimsey, "if I wanted people to think I'd been <==
poisoned I'd put up a better show than that."

"Stop talking, for God's sake," said the prisoner. "You've got me, by a
vile, damnable trick. Isn't that enough? You can shut up about it."

"Oh," said Parker, "we've got you, have we? Well, I warned you not to
talk, and if you _will_ do it, it's not my fault. By the way, Peter, I
don't suppose you did actually poison him, did you? It doesn't seem to
have hurt him, but it'll affect the doctor's report."

==> "No, I didn't, as a matter of fact," said Wimsey. "I only wanted to see <==
how he'd react to the suggestion. Well, cheerio! I can leave it to you
now."

"Three loud cheers!" said Eiluned.

Harriet greeted them a little vaguely.

verdict was given."

a little peevishly.

to judge and jury. The judge congratulated you, Miss Westlock, and I'm
sure he didn't say nearly enough--so plainly and well as you spoke up
before the whole court."

that young and tender, I says to Hannah at the time as it seemed a shame
to casserole it, for it would 'ave roasted beautiful. But Mr. Urquhart
is very partial to a casseroled chicken; he says as there's more flavour
to 'em that way, and I dunno but what he's right."

==> "If done with a good beef stock," pronounced Mr. Bunter, judicially, <==
"the vegetables well packed in layers, on a foundation of bacon, not too
fat, and the whole well seasoned with salt, pepper and paprika, there
are few dishes to beat a casseroled chicken. For my own part I would
recommend a soupçon of garlic, but I am aware that such is not agreeable
to all tastes."

frankly, "but as for the rest I'm with you, always allowing that the

juices perambulate through _and_ through each other as you might say.
I'm not denyin' as sech is very 'ighly enjoyable, and so Hannah and me

Urquhart wouldn't hear of it, and bein' as it's him that pays the bills,
he has the right to give his orders."

==> "Well," said Bunter, "it's certain if there had been anything <==
unwholesome about the casserole, you and Miss Westlock could scarcely
have escaped it."

"No, indeed," said Hannah, "for I won't conceal that, being blessed with
hearty appetites, we finished it every bit, except a little piece I gave

thing Mr. Boyes had to himself, like, Mr. Urquhart told me to cork it up
tight and keep it. And just as well we did, because, of course, the
police asked to see it when the time came."

"It was very far-seeing of Mr. Urquhart to take such precautions," said
==> Bunter, "when there wasn't any thought at the time but that the poor man <==
died naturally."

"That's what Nurse Williams said," replied Hannah, "but we put it down
to him being a solicitor and knowing what ought to be done in a case of
sudden death. Very particular he was, too--got me to put a bit of

it, so that it shouldn't be opened accidental. Nurse Williams always
said he expected an inquest, but Dr. Weare being there to speak to Mr.
Boyes having had these kind of bilious attacks all his life, of course
there was no question raised about giving the certificate."

==> "Of course not," said Bunter, "but it's very fortunate as it turns out <==
that Mr. Urquhart should have understood his duty so well. Many's the
case his lordship has seen in which an innocent man has been brought
near to the gallows for lack of a simple little precaution like that."

"He said dinner for half-past seven. That'll be the six-thirty, I should

At this moment Lord Peter had one of those bursts of illumination which
come suddenly when two unrelated facts make contact in the mind. In the
excitement of hearing Parker's news about the white paper packet, he had
==> paid insufficient attention to Bunter's account of the tea-party with <==
Hannah Westlock and Mrs. Pettican, but now he remembered something about
an actress, with a name like ''Yde Park or something of that.' The
readjustment made itself so smoothly and mechanically in his mind that
his next question followed almost without a pause.

"By all means, if you think it important. I do apologise for my
carelessness. In the meantime, is there anything else I can tell you
about the matter?"

Wimsey asked a few questions, covering the ground already traversed by
==> Bunter in his investigations, and took his departure. Miss Murchison was <==
again at work in the outer office. She did not look up as he passed.

"Curious," mused Wimsey, as he pattered along Bedford Row, "everybody is

Suddenly he woke up and read it a third time, noticing by no means
mechanically, the chipped p and the irregular capital A.

Then he sat down, wrote a line on a sheet of paper, folded it, addressed
==> it to Miss Murchison and sent Bunter out to post it. <==

For the first time, in this annoying case, he felt the vague stirring of
the waters as a living idea emerged slowly and darkly from the innermost
deeps of his mind.

He would be worth thousands to an American millionaire, most impressive,

Peter, I mean, though the other way on would be true too, I'm sure Peter
pays more attention to his opinion than he does to mine."

Wimsey had escaped, and was by now on his way to the stables. He met
Gerald, Duke of Denver, returning, with Freddy Arbuthnot in tow. The

Freddy, "but I believe some sort of bridegroom's friend comes into it.

when Miss Murchison entered the "Cattery," and she had never seen him
till a few weeks ago. This would be the first time she had actually
spoken to him. An odd-looking person, she thought, but people said he
had brains. Anyhow--

==> The door was opened by Bunter, who seemed to expect her and showed her <==
at once into a sitting-room lined with bookshelves. There were some fine
prints on the walls, an Aubusson carpet, a grand piano, a vast
Chesterfield and a number of deep and cosy chairs, upholstered in brown
leather. The curtains were drawn, a wood-fire blazed on the hearth, and
before it stood a table, with a silver tea-service whose lovely lines

"Frightfully good of you to come round, Miss Murchison. Beastly day,
isn't it? I'm sure you want your tea. Can you eat crumpets? Or would you
prefer something more up-to-date?"

elbow, "I like crumpets very much."

"Oh, good! Well, Bunter, we'll struggle with the tea-pot ourselves. Give

with a kind of anxious courtesy which pleased her. She expressed
admiration of the big bronze chrysanthemums heaped here and there about
the room.

"Oh! I'm glad you like them. My friends say they give a feminine touch

"The books look masculine enough."

On the way to the East End, Wimsey insisted upon talking music--rather

a little sinister in this pointed refusal to discuss the object of their
journey.

caressed the patina--and the impulse seized him to smash the mirror and
smash the face--to break out into great animal howls and gestures.

Silly! One could not do that. The inherited inhibitions of twenty
civilised centuries tied one hand and foot in bonds of ridicule. What if

unmoved and unsurprised, would sweep up the debris in a dust-pan, would
prescribe a hot bath and massage. And next day a new mirror would be
ordered, because people would come in and ask questions, and civilly
regret the accidental damage to the old one. And Harriet Vane would
still be hanged, just the same.

Miss Murchison needed no urging. She told her adventures, and had the

powder, the sentiments of the company expressed themselves in a round of

"It seems to me," said Miss Murchison, "that Hannah is an exceedingly
important witness for Mr. Urquhart's defence. You don't think--I hardly
==> like to suggest it--but you don't think that Bunter is allowing his <==
feelings to overcome his judgment?"

"He says," replied Lord Peter, "that he believes Hannah to be a
sincerely religious woman. He has sat beside her in chapel and shared
her hymn-book."

"But that may be the merest hypocrisy," said Miss Murchison, rather
warmly, for she was militantly rationalist. "I don't trust these
unctuous people."

"I didn't offer that as a proof of Hannah's virtue," said Wimsey, "but

"The devil!" cried Wimsey. "That's one up to you, Miss Murchison. We
didn't think of that. The water-bottle--yes--a perfectly fruity idea.
You recollect, Charles, that in the Bravo case, it was suggested that a
disgruntled servant had put tartar emetic in the water-bottle. Oh,

whether Mr. Boyes drank any water from his bedroom water-bottle before
dinner?"

"Pardon me, my lord, the possibility had already presented itself to my
mind."

"Yes," said Parker, modestly, "but I'm more logical, I think. And I'm
not being flustered by the Attorney-General. I should feel happier with
a little evidence of a more objective kind."

necessary for making a Marsh's test of arsenic. The distilled water was

"Oh, how right Diogenes was when he took his lantern to look for an

means."

Miss Murchison extracted the envelope and freed it from the enclosure.

small pieces which he dropped into the flask. The water bubbled
brightly, but the little tubes still remained stainless from end to end.

"Does something begin to happen soon?" enquired Mr. Arbuthnot. "Because

Bunter accordingly opened the second envelope, and delicately dropped
the white powder into the wide mouth of the flask. All five heads bent
eagerly over the apparatus. And presently, definitely, magically, a thin

The theatre-going crowds surged home in saloon and taxi, the lights
shone over the empty width of Piccadilly, the heavy night-lorries
rumbled slow and seldom over the black tarmac, the long night waned and
the reluctant winter dawn struggled wanly over the tiled roofs of

Photography" over and over again.

important to remember that she is a writer of so-called 'mystery' or
'detective' stories, such as deal with various ingenious methods of
committing murder and other crimes.

unprotected position, still feel that she was a person of unstable moral
character. You will not be led away by the false glamour which certain
writers contrive to throw about 'free love,' into thinking that this was
anything but an ordinary, vulgar act of misbehavior. Sir Impey Biggs,
very rightly using all his great eloquence on behalf of his client, has

library."

"Philip Boyes and the prisoner lived together in this fashion," went on
the judge, "for nearly a year. Various friends have testified that they
appeared to live on terms of the greatest mutual affection. Miss Price
==> said that, although Harriet Vane obviously felt her unfortunate position <==
very acutely--cutting herself off from her family friends and refusing
to thrust herself into company where her social outlawry might cause
embarrassment and so on--yet she was extremely loyal to her lover and
expressed herself proud and happy to be his companion.

"Nevertheless, in February 1929 there was a quarrel, and the couple
separated. It is not denied that the quarrel took place. Mr. and Mrs.
Dyer, who occupy the flat immediately above Philip Boyes', say that they
heard loud talking in angry voices, the man swearing and the woman
==> crying, and that the next day, Harriet Vane packed up all her things and <==
left the house for good. The curious feature in the case, and one which
you must consider very carefully, is the reason assigned for the
quarrel. As to this, the only evidence we have is the prisoner's own.
According to Miss Marriott, with whom Harriet Vane took refuge after the
separation, the prisoner steadily refused to give any information on the

subject, saying only that she had been painfully deceived by Boyes and
never wished to hear his name spoken again.

note--a vigorous note, to judge from the action of her pencil on the
paper. Lord Peter Wimsey shook his head slowly two or three times and
muttered something under his breath.

"After this," said the judge, "nothing particular seems to have happened
==> to these two people for three months or so, except that Harriet Vane <==
left Miss Marriott's house and took a small flat of her own in Doughty
Street, while Philip Boyes, on the contrary, finding his solitary life
depressing, accepted the invitation of his cousin, Mr. Norman Urquhart,
to stay at the latter's house in Woburn Square. Although living in the
same quarter of London, Boyes and the accused do not seem to have met

another in the second week in April, and a third some time in May. These
times are worth noting, though, as the exact day is left doubtful, you
must not attach too much importance to them.

"However, we now come to a date of the very greatest importance. On
==> April 10th, a young woman, who has been identified as Harriet Vane, <==
entered the chemist's shop kept by Mr. Brown in Southampton Row, and
purchased two ounces of commercial arsenic, saying that she needed it to
destroy rats. She signed the poison-book in the name of Mary Slater, and
the handwriting has been identified as that of the prisoner. Moreover,
the prisoner herself admits having made this purchase, for certain

destroy rats. She signed the poison-book in the name of Mary Slater, and
the handwriting has been identified as that of the prisoner. Moreover,
the prisoner herself admits having made this purchase, for certain
reasons of her own. For this reason it is comparatively unimportant--but
you may think it worth noting--that the housekeeper of the flats where
==> Harriet Vane lives has come here and told you that there are no rats on <==
the premises, and never have been in the whole time of her residence
there.

"On May 5th. we have another purchase of arsenic. The prisoner, as she
herself states, this time procured a tin of arsenical weed-killer, of

and so on, and aching in the limbs. Plenty of people have such troubles
from time to time. Still, there is a coincidence of dates here which may
be significant. We get these attacks--noted in Dr. Weare's
case-book--one on the 31st. of March, one on the 15th. of April and one
on the 12th. of May. Three sets of coincidences--as you may perhaps

"After the third attack--the one in May--the doctor advises Boyes to go
away for a change, and he selects the north-west corner of Wales. He
goes to Harlech, and spends a very pleasant time there and is much
better. But he has a friend to accompany him, Mr. Ryland Vaughan, whom
you have seen, and this friend says that 'Philip was not happy'. In

Vane. His bodily health improved, but he grew mentally depressed. And so
on June 16th, we find him writing a letter to Miss Vane. Now that is an
important letter, so I will read it to you once more:

harmless.

"This brings us to 9 o'clock. After dinner, coffee is offered, but Boyes

Boyes leaves Mr. Urquhart's house in Woburn Square, and is driven in a

growing weaker, and the skin about the mouth getting dry and peeling
off. The doctors gave him every attention, but could do nothing for him.
His father was summoned, and when he arrived he found his son conscious,
but unable to lift himself. He was able to speak, however, and in the
presence of his father and Nurse Williams he made the remark, 'I'm going

now--I didn't know she hated me quite so much.' Now that was a very
remarkable speech, and we have heard two very different interpretations
put upon it. It is for you to say whether, in your opinion, he meant:
'She has succeeded in getting rid of me; I didn't know she hated me
enough to poison me,' or whether he meant, 'When I realised she hated me

so, and if they had discovered that the illness was caused by arsenic,
they would not have been able to do anything more to save the life of
this unfortunate man. At any rate, what happened was that Nurse Williams
was sent, during the last week of June, to nurse another patient of Dr.
Weare's, who happened to belong to the same literary set in Bloomsbury
==> as Philip Boyes and Harriet Vane, and while she was there, she spoke <==
about Philip Boyes, and said that, in her opinion, the illness looked
very much like poisoning, and she even mentioned the word arsenic. Well,
you know how a thing like that gets about. One person tells another and
it is discussed at tea-parties, or what are known, I believe, as
cocktail parties, and very soon a story gets spread about, and people

mention names and take sides. Miss Marriott and Miss Price were told
about it, and it also got to the ears of Mr. Vaughan. Now Mr. Vaughan
had been greatly distressed and surprised by Philip Boyes' death,
especially as he had been with him in Wales, and knew how much he had
improved in health while on his holiday, and he also felt very strongly
==> that Harriet Vane had behaved badly about the love-affair. Mr. Vaughan <==
felt that some action ought to be taken about the matter, and went to
Mr. Urquhart and put the story before him. Now Mr. Urquhart is a
solicitor, and is therefore inclined to take a cautious view of rumours
and suspicions, and he warned Mr. Vaughan that it was not wise to go
about making accusations against people, for fear of an action for

[line number in concatenated text file] matching line = 38152    window = 38147 38157


poisoning and of acute gastritis are really indistinguishable.

"When this was communicated to Mr. Vaughan, he was confirmed in his
suspicions, and wrote to the elder Mr. Boyes suggesting an enquiry. Mr.
Boyes was naturally very much shocked, and said at once that the matter
==> should be taken up. He had known of the liaison with Harriet Vane, and <==
had noticed that she did not come to enquire after Philip Boyes, nor
attend the funeral, and this had struck him as heartless behavior. In
the end, the police were communicated with and an exhumation order
obtained.

persistent vomiting and diarrhoea and so on, points to a large dose
having been taken at some time.

"Now there was a great deal of discussion about the time at which the
symptoms first set in. It is suggested by the defence that Philip Boyes
==> may have taken the arsenic himself at some time between leaving Harriet <==
Vane's flat and hailing the taxi in Guilford Street; and they bring
forward books which show that in many cases the onset of symptoms takes
place in a very short time after taking the arsenic--a quarter of an
hour, I think, was the shortest time mentioned where the arsenic was
taken in liquid form. Now the prisoner's statement--and we have no

arsenic, which he must in that case have brought with him in
anticipation of an unfavourable interview with the prisoner? And I may
remind you here, that the defence have brought no evidence to show that
Philip Boyes ever bought any arsenic, or had access to any arsenic. That
is not to say he could not have obtained it--the purchases made by
==> Harriet Vane show that the law about the sale of poisons is not always <==
as effective as one would like it to be--but the fact remains that the
defence have not been able to show that the deceased ever had arsenic in
his possession. And while we are on this subject, I will mention that,
curiously enough, the analysts could find no traces of the charcoal, or
indigo, with which commercial arsenic is supposed to be mixed. Whether

between the quarrel and the death, and four months between the first
illness and the death, and you may think that there is some significance
in these dates.

"We now come to the enquiries made by the police. When suspicion was
==> aroused, detectives investigated Harriet Vane's movements and <==
subsequently went to her flat to take a statement from her. When they
told her that Boyes was found to have died of arsenic poisoning, she
appeared very much surprised, and said, 'Arsenic? What an extraordinary
thing!' And then, she laughed, and said, 'Why, I am writing a book all
about arsenic poisoning.' They asked her about the purchases of arsenic

Here Sir Impey Biggs interposed and begged with submission to suggest
that his lordship should remind the jury of the evidence given by Mr.
Challoner.

"Certainly, Sir Impey, I am obliged to you. You remember that Mr.
==> Challoner is Harriet Vane's literary agent. He came here to tell us that <==
he had discussed with her as long ago as last December the subject of
her forthcoming book, and she then told him that it was to be about
poisons, and very probably about arsenic. So you may think it is a point
in the prisoner's favour that this intention of studying the purchase
and administration of arsenic was already in her mind some time before

then embarrassed the unfortunate young woman with the burden of an
honour unto which she was not born. I've no doubt he made himself
perfectly intolerable about it, with his ancient oaks and family plate,
and the curtseying tenantry and all the rest of it."

==> Harriet Vane laughed once more. <==

"Yes--it's ridiculous--but humiliating too. Well, there it is. I thought
Philip had made both himself and me ridiculous, and the minute I saw
that--well, the whole thing simply shut down--flop!"

"No; I was looking beyond that. What I mean to say is, when all this is
over, I want to marry you, if you can put up with me and all that."

==> Harriet Vane, who had been smiling at him, frowned, and an indefinable <==
expression of distaste came into her eyes.

"Oh, are you another of them? That makes forty-seven."

"Forty-seven what?" asked Wimsey, much taken aback.

might even help to distinguish me from the other forty-six, if you
should happen to mislay my features, or anything. Oh, by the way--I
don't positively repel you or anything like that, do I? Because, if I
do, I'll take my name off the waiting-list at once."

==> "No," said Harriet Vane, kindly and a little sadly. "No, you don't repel <==
me."

"I don't remind you of white slugs or make you go goose-flesh all over?"

"Certainly not."

"Well, then there is another letter, saying that the marriage had fallen
through. Here it is. 'Dear Dad--sorry, but I'm afraid your
congratulations must be returned with thanks. The wedding is off, and
==> the bride has run away. There's no need to go into the story. Harriet <==
has succeeded in making a fool of herself and me, so there's no more to

that you know already."

"Did he suggest any reason for these illnesses of his?"

Wimsey begged him not to mention it, and with a cordial farewell ran
hastily down the stairs.

Challoner was an abrupt, dark, militant-looking little man, with untidy
hair and thick spectacles.

Lord Peter Wimsey almost bounced into Holloway Prison next morning.

"So you've reappeared?"

"Good lord, yes! Surely you expected me to. I fancied I'd left that

for a living, and was therefore usually to be found either in her studio
or in some one else's studio. A telephone-call at 10 a.m. would probably
catch her scrambling eggs over her own gas-stove. It was true that there
had been passages, about the time of the Bellona Club affair,[1] between
her and Lord Peter which made it a little embarrassing and unkind to

which to pick and choose his tools, Wimsey was past worrying about
gentlemanly scruples. He put the call through and was relieved to hear
an answering "Hullo!"

there was to it. Just because she couldn't write anything but tripe

You'd think it would have been enough for her to help and look after a
genius like Phil, wouldn't you? Why, damn it, he used to ask her advice
about his work, her advice, good lord!"

and that sort of thing. The minute I saw him I knew he was out to ruin
Philip, body and soul. What he wanted--what Phil wanted, I mean--was
freedom and room to turn about in, but what with the woman and the
cousin and the father in the background--oh, well! It's no use crying

more probable."

In theory it might do so, but the theory did not square as well as
Wimsey could have wished with what he had heard about the character of
Philip Boyes. Personally, he was inclined to put more faith in the idea
==> that the final interview with Harriet had been the deciding factor in <==
the suicide. But this, too, was not quite satisfactory. He could not
believe that Philip had felt that particular kind of affection for
Harriet Vane. Perhaps, though, it was merely that he did not want to
think well of the man. His emotions, he feared, clouding his judgment a
little.

lived in Bloomsbury and led an ideal existence, full of love and

"I'm sorry," he said; "the fact is, I'm most damnably jealous of this
fellow Boyes. I oughtn't to be, but I am."

"And if I was, I shouldn't be fit to live with. Is that it?"

"You would be very unhappy. Quite apart from all the other drawbacks."

there was nothing in any of them--except Barbara, of course."

"Oh, a girl. I owe her quite a lot, really," replied Wimsey, musingly.

wounded feelings, and it's really been great fun, take it all in all.
Dear me, yes--I was very much bowled over that time. I even took a

Wimsey pulled himself together, called for his hat and coat, and went
away in a taxi to call on Miss Climpson.

They can't eat me. They can't even cut me, if it comes to that. Joke,

"No, I suppose they can't cut you. You wouldn't have to slink abroad

watering-places like people in Victorian novels."

"Top-hole to see old Wimsey back, isn't it?" he said, with simple
kindliness. "Wonderful how keen he is on this sort of thing, don't you
know. Rampages off the minute he gets home like the jolly old war-horse
sniffing the T.N.T. Regularly up to the eyes in it."

==> "Well, it's one of Chief-Inspector Parker's cases, and they're such <==
great friends, you know, quite like David and Beersheba--or do I mean
Daniel?"

Wimsey joined them at this complicated moment, and tucked his mother's
arm affectionately in his own.

Lord Peter. Sir Impey Biggs, having watched over his client's interests
to the last, disappeared, chatting cheerfully to the Attorney-General,
and followed by the smaller legal fry. The dock was deserted. On the
bench the red roses stood solitary, their petals dropping.

==> Chief-Inspector Parker, disengaging himself from a group of friends, <==
came slowly up through the crowd and greeted the Dowager. "And what do
you think of it, Peter?" he added, turning to Wimsey, "rather neatly got
up, eh?"

"Charles," said Wimsey, "you ought not to be allowed out without me.

"You don't really think that."

"I do."

==> Parker looked distressed. He had confidence in Wimsey's judgment, and, <==
in spite of his own interior certainty, he felt shaken.

"My dear man, where's the flaw in it?"

"There isn't one. It's damnably knife-proof. There's nothing wrong about

"My dear man, where's the flaw in it?"

"There isn't one. It's damnably knife-proof. There's nothing wrong about
it at all, except that the girl's innocent."

==> "You're turning into a common or garden psychologist," said Parker, with <==
an uneasy laugh, "isn't he, Duchess?"

"I wish I had known that girl," replied the Dowager, in her usual
indirect manner, "so interesting and a really remarkable face, though
perhaps not strictly good-looking, and all the more interesting for

"Too late, too late, you cannot enter now. I have locked my heart in a
silver box and pinned it wi' a golden pin. Nobody's opinion matters now,
except the jury's. I expect Miss Climpson is telling 'em all about it.
When once she starts she doesn't stop for an hour or two."

==> "Well, they've been half-an-hour now," said Parker. <==

"Still waiting?" said Salcombe Hardy, returning to the press-table.

"Yes--so this is what you call twenty minutes! Three-quarters of an
hour, I make it."

"I expect that can be done," said Sir Impey. "In the meantime you have
nothing to suggest?"

"Haven't had time yet. But I'll fish out something, don't you worry.
I've already started to undermine the confidence of the police.
==> Chief-Inspector Parker has gone home to twine willow-wreaths for his own <==
tomb-stone."

"You'll be careful," said Sir Impey. "Anything we can discover will come
in much more effectively if the prosecution don't know of it
beforehand."

telephone-line to Scotland Yard, and that few of her ladies were quite
so unprotected as they appeared. It is also a fact that the money which
paid for the rent and upkeep of the premises might, by zealous
enquirers, have been traced to Lord Peter Wimsey's banking account. His
lordship was somewhat reticent about this venture of his, but
==> occasionally, when closeted with Chief-Inspector Parker or other <==
intimate friends, referred to it as "My Cattery."

Miss Climpson poured out a cup of tea before replying. She wore a
quantity of little bangles on her spare, lace-covered wrists, and they
chinked aggressively with every movement.

Yard.

==> Chief Detective-Inspector Parker was, as usual, delighted to see Lord <==
Peter, but there was a worried expression on his plain though pleasant
face as he greeted his visitor.

"What is it, Peter? The Vane case again?"

straight. Even the path of the light is curved--or so they tell us. For
God's sake, old man, do what you can to put the thing right before next
assizes. If you don't, I'll never forgive you. Damn it, you don't _want_
to hang the wrong person, do you?--especially a woman and all that."

==> "Have a fag," said Parker. "You're looking quite wild about the eyes. <==
What have you been doing with yourself? I'm sorry if we've got the wrong
pig by the ear, but it's the defence's business to point out where we're
wrong, and I can't say they put up a very convincing show."

"No, confound them. Biggy did his best, but that fool and beast Crofts

"No, confound them. Biggy did his best, but that fool and beast Crofts
gave him no materials at all. Blast his ugly eyes! I know the brute
thinks she did it. I hope he will fry in hell and be served up with
cayenne pepper on a red-hot dish!"

==> "What eloquence!" said Parker, unimpressed. "Anybody would think you'd <==
gone goopy over the girl."

"That's a damned friendly way to talk," said Wimsey, bitterly. "When you
went off the deep end about my sister, I may have been unsympathetic--I
daresay I was--but I swear I didn't dance on your tenderest feelings and

daresay I was--but I swear I didn't dance on your tenderest feelings and
call your manly devotion 'going goopy over a girl.' I don't know where
you pick up such expressions, as the clergyman's wife said to the
parrot. 'Goopy,' indeed! I never heard anything so vulgar!"

==> "Good lord," exclaimed Parker, "you don't seriously say--" <==

"Oh, no!" retorted Wimsey, bitterly. "I'm not expected to be serious. A
buffoon, that's what I am. I now know exactly what Jack Point feels
like. I used to think the 'Yeomen' sentimental tosh, but it is all too
true. Would you like to see me dance in motley?"

==> "I'm sorry," said Parker, taking his cue rather from the tone than the <==
words. "If it's like that, I'm damned sorry, old man. But what can I
do?"

"Now you're talking. Look here--the most likely thing is that this
unsavoury blighter Boyes committed suicide. The unspeakable defence

unsavoury blighter Boyes committed suicide. The unspeakable defence
haven't been able to trace any arsenic to his possession--but then they
probably couldn't trace a herd of black cattle over a snow-bound field
in broad noonday with a microscope. I want your people to take it up."

==> "Boyes--query arsenic," said Parker, making a note on a pad. "Anything <==
else?"

"Yes. Find out if Boyes visited any pub. in the neighbourhood of Doughty
Street between, say, 9.50 and 10.10 on the night of Jan. 20th--if he met
anybody, and what he took to drink."

"Thirdly, if any bottle or paper that might have contained arsenic was
picked up in that district."

"A bottle is more likely than a paper," went on Wimsey, ignoring him,
"because I think the arsenic must have been taken in liquid form to work
so quickly."

==> Parker made no further protest, but noted down "Boyes--Doughty <==
Street--query bottle," and paused expectantly.

"Yes?"

"That's all for the moment. By the way, I should try the garden in

Wimsey pranced back into the room.

==> "Here you are, Peter," said Chief-Inspector Parker, "and here is the <==
lady you are anxious to meet. Mrs. Bulfinch, allow me to introduce Lord
Peter Wimsey."

"Pleased, I am sure," said Mrs. Bulfinch. She giggled, and dabbed her
large, blonde face with powder.

"Pleased, I am sure," said Mrs. Bulfinch. She giggled, and dabbed her
large, blonde face with powder.

"Mrs. Bulfinch, before her union with Mr. Bulfinch, was the life and
soul of the saloon bar at the Nine Rings in Grays Inn Road," said Mr.
==> Parker, "and well-known to all for her charm and wit." <==

"Go on," said Mrs. Bulfinch, "you're a one, aren't you? Don't you pay no
attention to him, your lordship. You know what these police fellows
are."

not, never having been accustomed to it, so you can do as you like.' So
I came away and left him to it: Mind you, I like him for it. I ain't
saying nothing against Bulfinch, but police or no police, I reckon I
know how to take care of myself."

==> "Quite so," said Parker, patiently. "Mr. Bulfinch need feel no alarm. <==
All we want you to do is to tell us, to the best of your recollection,
about that young man you spoke of and help us to find the white-paper
packet. You may be able to save an innocent person from being convicted,
and I am sure your husband could not object to that."

"Not within a day or so I couldn't, for I wouldn't wish to swear to a
fib, but it wasn't far off the longest day, for I remember making that
same remark to the gentleman for something to say, you know."

==> "That's near enough," said Parker. "Round about June 20th, or 21st, or <==
something like that?"

"That's right, as near as I can speak to it. And as to the time of
night, that I _can_ tell you--knowing how keen you 'tecs always are on

"How much powder do you think he put in?"

"Oh, a good dollop. He didn't measure it or anything, just shot it in
out of the packet. Near a dessert spoonful it might have been."

"Ah, there you are." Mrs. Bulfinch took a glance at Wimsey's face and
seemed pleased with the effect she was producing.

"We'd just got the last customer out--about five past eleven, that would

because I looked to see what it was."

"You didn't try tasting it, I suppose?"

"Not me. It might have been poison or something. I tell you, he was a

"Was that what you thought at the time?" enquired Wimsey, "or did it
only occur to you later on--after you'd read about the case, you know?"

"I thought it at the time, of course," retorted Mrs. Bulfinch,

The gentleman might have come back for it. So I stuck it up on the shelf

again from that day to yesterday, when your policeman came round about
it."

"Well, I don't know about that. I put it there and I left the Rings in
August, so what's gone with it I can't say. Daresay they threw it away

George said, 'Now don't you get fancies, Gracie my girl; you don't want
to get mixed up in a police case.' George has always held his head high,
you see."

severely.

"Well, how was I to know it was important? The taxi-driver had seen him
a few minutes afterwards and he was ill then, so the powder couldn't

of 'em, the ladies aren't in it with the gentlemen."

"I may pass this on to the solicitors for the defence, I suppose?" said
Wimsey, when the witness had departed.

==> "Of course," said Parker, "that's why I asked you to come and hear <==
it--for what it's worth. Meanwhile, we shall of course have a good hunt
for the packet."

"Yes," said Wimsey, thoughtfully, "yes--you will have to do
that--naturally."

and I'll make you damn well believe it before I've done."

"Excellent, excellent," said Mr. Crofts, suavely, "nobody will be more

them for very many years."

At this moment Lord Peter had one of those bursts of illumination which
come suddenly when two unrelated facts make contact in the mind. In the
==> excitement of hearing Parker's news about the white paper packet, he had <==
paid insufficient attention to Bunter's account of the tea-party with
Hannah Westlock and Mrs. Pettican, but now he remembered something about
an actress, with a name like ''Yde Park or something of that.' The
readjustment made itself so smoothly and mechanically in his mind that
his next question followed almost without a pause.

Lady Mary stared into the fire.

"I suppose it would. But it would probably upset them just as much if he

On leaving Miss Climpson, Lord Peter Wimsey again found himself a prey
to Weltschmerz and self-pity. But it now took the form of a gentle,
pervading melancholy. Convinced of his own futility, he determined to do
what little good lay in his power before retiring to a monastery or to

Parker was in his office, reading a report which had just come in. He

my sister."

"About Lady Mary?"

accompanied as it was by tedious demonstrations of affection for
himself. Like the man in Max Beerbohm's story, Wimsey "hated to be
touching." He was only moderately cheered by hearing from the
industrious Freddy Arbuthnot that Mr. Norman Urquhart was found to be
more or less deeply involved in the disasters of the Megatherium Trust.

eagerly over the apparatus. And presently, definitely, magically, a thin
silver stain began to form in the tube where the flame impinged upon it.
Second by second it spread and darkened to a deep brownish-black ring
with a shining metallic centre.

==> "Oh, lovely, lovely," said Parker, with professional delight. <==

"Your lamp's smoking or something," said Freddy.

"Is that arsenic?" breathed Miss Murchison, gently.

chlorinated lime should decide the question beyond reach of cavil."

He performed this further test amid an anxious silence. The stain
dissolved out and vanished under the bleaching solution.

==> "Then it is arsenic," said Parker. <==

"Oh, yes," said Wimsey, nonchalantly, "of course it is arsenic. Didn't I
tell you?" His voice wavered a little with suppressed triumph.

"Is that all?" inquired Freddy, disappointed.

"Is that all?" inquired Freddy, disappointed.

"Isn't it enough?" said Miss Murchison.

==> "Not quite," said Parker, "but it's a long way towards it. It proves <==
that Urquhart has arsenic in his possession, and by making an official
enquiry in France, we can probably find out whether this packet was
already in his possession last June. I notice, by the way, that it is
ordinary white arsenious acid, without any mixture of charcoal or
indigo, which agrees with what was found at the post-mortem. That's

the meantime, you will no doubt take steps to secure, in an official and
laborious manner, the evidence which our kind friends here have already
so ably gathered in by unconventional methods, and will stand by to
arrest the right man when the time comes?"

==> "I will," said Parker, "gladly. Apart from all personal considerations, <==
I'd far rather see that oily-haired fellow in the dock than any woman,
and if the Force has made a mistake, the sooner it's put right the
better for all concerned."

The manicurist, who had been discovered by the help of Chief-Inspector
==> Parker and his sleuths, was a kitten-faced child with an inviting manner <==
and a shrewd eye. She made no bones about accepting her client's
invitation to dine, and showed no surprise when he confidentially
murmured that he had a little proposition to put before her. She put her
plump elbows on the table, cocked her head at a coy angle, and prepared
to sell her honour dear.

The lawyer stumbled out. Wimsey returned to the library and rang the
bell.

"Very good, my lord."

Bunter departed and Wimsey waited. Presently there were sounds of a

"Very good, my lord."

Bunter departed and Wimsey waited. Presently there were sounds of a
scuffle in the distance. A group appeared at the door. Urquhart, very

"Was he sick?" asked Wimsey, with interest.

"No, he wasn't," said Parker, grimly, snapping the handcuffs on his

white, his hair and clothes disordered, flanked by Parker and Bunter,
who held him firmly by the arms.

"Was he sick?" asked Wimsey, with interest.

==> "No, he wasn't," said Parker, grimly, snapping the handcuffs on his <==
prey. "He cursed you fluently for five minutes, then tried to get out of
the window, saw it was a three-story drop, charged in through the
dressing-room door and ran straight into me. Now don't struggle, my lad,
you'll only hurt yourself."

poisoned I'd put up a better show than that."

"Stop talking, for God's sake," said the prisoner. "You've got me, by a
vile, damnable trick. Isn't that enough? You can shut up about it."

==> "Oh," said Parker, "we've got you, have we? Well, I warned you not to <==
talk, and if you _will_ do it, it's not my fault. By the way, Peter, I
don't suppose you did actually poison him, did you? It doesn't seem to
have hurt him, but it'll affect the doctor's report."

"No, I didn't, as a matter of fact," said Wimsey. "I only wanted to see

"No, I didn't, as a matter of fact," said Wimsey. "I only wanted to see
how he'd react to the suggestion. Well, cheerio! I can leave it to you
now."

==> "We'll look after him," said Parker. "But you might let Bunter ring up a <==
taxi."

When the prisoner and his escort had departed, Wimsey turned
thoughtfully to Bunter, glass in hand.
